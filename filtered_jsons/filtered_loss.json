        "justification": "There's no evidence that Oprah Winfrey suffered a \"tragedy\" or died in early May 2022, nor did she endorse keto weight loss gummies. These claims, one of which resembled a death hoax, came from misleading text messages that were sent out to an unknown number of recipients. Oprah Winfrey keto Scammers sent the text messages with the words, \"Fans react to the Oprah tragedy.\" The texts also included a link: Scammers Oprah    We don't recommend trusting text messages like these. Upon clicking the link, we were led to a fraudulent page that was purposely designed to mimic a Time magazine article. In reality, Time.com had nothing to do with the page. This bore similarities to another keto scam that used the image and likeness of \"The Price Is Right\" host Drew Carey, which we previously reported on days before publishing this story. Time magazine Time.com The Price Is Right Drew Carey reported The fake Time.com article mentioned nothing of Winfrey having died or suffered a tragedy, as the text messages were nothing more than misleading clickbait. The article falsely claimed Winfrey had personally endorsed keto weight loss gummies such as Keto Start ACV, Gemini Keto, Kwazi Keto Gummies, Slim Mediq Keto Gummies, Trim Life Keto + ACV Gummies, and perhaps others. It used both her image and likeness to sell the products. Winfrey Winfrey    Winfrey did not endorse any of these keto weight loss gummy products, nor did she die or suffer a tragedy in early May 2022. We noticed that the product name changed in the article when we refreshed. This perhaps indicated that the product name was rotated on a timed basis or that specific product names showed up in specific locations, depending on the user's IP address. Basically, the fake Winfrey endorsement was used for more than one keto gummies product. The articles on genuinesmother.com and newsurvey22offer.com began as follows: Oprah Launches First-Ever \"Weight Loss Gummy\" in Partnership with Weight Watchers After Being Forced to Lose 60 LBS in Just Weeks (Time) - In an insightful 1-on-1 interview, one of the world's most prominent talk show host reveals how she forced Weight Watchers to create a transformational weight loss product the world has never seen before. Gifted host, and business genius, Oprah Winfrey, made headlines after bringing the first ever \"Weight Loss Gummy\" to the market on live TV last week in memory of her heart failure just last year. Ever since Oprah was forced to lose 60 lbs due to her heart failure risk, Winfrey and her team have been working alongside the team at Weight Watchers to develop a better weight loss product that helps people quickly lose weight and keep it off for good. Oprah Winfrey Despite what's mentioned in the article, we found no evidence that Winfrey had suffered heart failure in 2021, nor did we find any data on Weight Watchers supposedly creating keto weight loss gummies. Both of these claims appeared to have been fabricated. Winfrey Weight Watchers The article went on to make the baseless claim that the long-running program \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" had been \"canceled because the producers were not happy with\" her \"weight and appearance.\" It also claimed that Winfrey appeared on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" to promote the keto weight loss gummies that had supposedly been created by Weight Watchers. This also was false. Winfrey Ellen DeGeneres Weight Watchers The end of the page claimed that Winfrey herself was offering a \"free\" bottle of keto weight loss gummies to readers, whether that product be Keto Start ACV, Gemini Keto, Kwazi Keto Gummies, Slim Mediq Keto Gummies, Trim Life Keto + ACV Gummies, or another one. The article said, \"The only thing you'll need to pay for is the shipping rate, which is less than $6!\" Winfrey However, we read through the terms and conditions pages for the various products, which were not easy to find. The fine print said that purchasing a \"free\" bottle of the keto weight loss gummies enrolled customers in a \"trial,\" \"program,\" or \"subscription\" that would eventually charge the full cost on a monthly basis. One product's terms and condition page said the charges would occur \"every 30 days after the initial purchase.\" In order to cancel a recurring order, customers would first need to contact the company to initiate the process. However, that might be a problem for anyone who opted for a \"free\" bottle of Kwazi Keto Gummies. In the terms and conditions for that specific product, it listed no phone number. The contact page on the Kwazi Keto Gummies website showed only this email address: care@buykwazi.com. Even worse, the area that was supposed to show the return shipping address was left blank, making it more difficult for people to get their money back:    A package won't get very far without a shipping address. We contacted Kwazi Keto Gummies to ask about the absence of the phone number and shipping address. Within minutes, the page with the fake Time.com article that used Winfrey's image and likeness changed to a fake keto endorsement from the cast of \"Shark Tank,\" which we reported on before. It then switched to another scam page that claimed singer-songwriter Adele Adkins, better known simply as Adele, had also endorsed keto weight loss gummies. All of this was false. reported Adele In sum, no, there's no evidence that Winfrey suffered a \"tragedy\" or died in early May 2022, nor did she endorse keto weight loss gummies that had been created by Weight Watchers. All of this was misleading and false. Winfrey Weight Watchers",

            "An online article that featured the People magazine logo said Cowell \"shocked everyone when he announced his departure from the show.\""
        ],
        "justification": "In June 2023, paid ads were displaying on Facebook and Instagram that led to a claim that said Simon Cowell would be leaving \"America's Got Talent,\" NBC's performance-competition TV show that's perhaps better known as \"AGT.\" However, not only was this false, but the reason for these ads was to lure users to a scam that might end up costing those users thousands of dollars a year. The claim made by this scam was that Cowell had endorsed an \"amazing miracle gummy product\" for weight loss called G6 Keto ACV Gummies, with \"ACV\" standing for apple cider vinegar. To be clear, none of this was true. Cowell never endorsed any CBD or keto weight loss gummy products. His image and likeness were being used without permission. Further, we don't recommend placing trust in weight loss promises that feature the words \"amazing miracle.\" In this story, we'll walk through how this scam worked, including shedding light on the strange return addresses that appeared on packages that customers who ordered similar gummies had received in the past. The Facebook and Instagram ads with Cowell featured before-and-after pictures that appeared to show a weight loss transformation. \"Simon Cowell Shares How He Dropped 56 In Just Weeks,\" the ads read.  The link in the ads directed users to a specific page on the website brownnature.art. Before clicking on the link in the ad, we decided to check out the homepage for brownnature.art. According to what we found, this website appeared to have been created for the sole purpose of running scams. How did we know this? A fake bookstore served as the facade for the scam operation on the website. This bookstore didn't have any payment options enabled, which meant that users couldn't order any of the books the website claimed to offer. Back to the subject about the ads that featured Cowell, we clicked the link that took us to a specific page on brownnature.art. An article loaded in our browser that featured a People magazine logo. \"Simon Cowell Confirms He is 'LEAVING' America's Got Talent After His Accidental 'Live' Confession On-Air,\" the false headline of the story read.  The article also falsely claimed that celebrities Kelly Clarkson and Melissa McCarthy had lost weight with G6 Keto ACV Gummies. Both Clarkson and McCarthy have been featured in these scams for years, even though they have nothing to do with any keto weight loss gummies. This was not a story that People magazine had ever published. Scammers had replicated on brownnature.art the design of how articles are displayed on people.com, the official website for the magazine, all as a way to try to fool users into believing they were reading an authentic story put out by the publication. After clicking on one of the many links in the fake People magazine article on brownnature.art, we were led to the G6 Keto ACV Gummies website,secure.get6gproducts.com/v1/. The creator or creators of the product's website published several false statements that were an extension of the scam seen in the social media ads and the fake People magazine article. secure.get6gproducts.com/v1/ For example, Dr. Mehmet Oz never called the product the \"holy grail\" of weight loss, nor did the Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism medical journal publish any pieces about the gummies, as the G6 website claimed. never called the product The G6 website also included mentions of CBS News, NBC, CNN, Women's Health, Woman's World, and Honolulu Magazine, even though these publications never featured, mentioned, or endorsed anything about the product. Perhaps worst of all was the fact that no phone number was available on the G6 website, not even in its privacy policy or terms and conditions documentation. In fact, part of the terms and conditions left two spaces after \"TOLL FREE\" where the phone number belonged: \"Please contact Customer service at TOLL FREE between the hours of 9am EST - 9pm EST Mon - Sat with any questions regarding your product, payment or return.\" We've seen phone numbers be omitted like this on CBD and keto weight loss gummies websites for more than a year. This was not a one-time issue. For many months, we've been observing comments from purported customers who complained about being victims of CBD and keto weight loss gummies scams. Many of these comments were posted to YouTube and contained detailed accounts of how they were scammed. These customers often said in their comments that they were charged around $200 after believing they would only be paying about $40. They also said that they were surprised that making a purchase enrolled them in a subscription that would charge their credit card hundreds of dollars per month, charges that would end up totaling thousands of dollars per year. Additionally, customers said that when the gummy packages arrived at their doorstep, they contained no real identifying information about a parent company or anything about the people behind the products. According to the customers, the packages only would include the two words \"fulfillment center\" with a P.O. Box physical mailing address for Tampa, Florida, or Las Vegas, Nevada. Customers often reported a return address with the city of Smyrna, Tennessee. If any readers ordered CBD or keto gummies that promised an \"amazing miracle\" involving weight loss, we recommend they contact their credit card company to inform them of the scam. Again, these scams sign customers up for subscriptions. Unless action is taken, a new charge for hundreds of dollars will be placed on customers' credit cards every month. As for how Cowell truly lost weight, he once credited dropping pounds to hisvegan diet. We found no credible reporting that said anything about him ever consuming gummies. vegan diet To be completely clear, we have never found even one real example of a celebrity who endorsed CBD or keto weight loss gummies.

For readers unfamiliar with \"Little People, Big World,\" it's a reality TV show that follows the lives of the Roloff family. reality TV show \"Matt and Amy Roloff, both 4 feet tall, face a variety of challenges in raising their four children: twins Jeremy and Zach, who is 2-feet shorter than his brother, and younger siblings Molly and Jacob, who like Jeremy are average height,\" a synopsis on TheTVDB.com reads. \"The family's 34-acre Oregon farm serves as part playground and part moneymaker. As the series ages, Matt and Amy deal with personal strife, embrace their kids getting older and leading lives of their own, become grandparents, and attempt to keep Roloff Farms operational.\" synopsis The show began airing on TLC in 2006 and is often referred to by the acronym, \"LPBW.\" Matt and Amy divorced in 2015. airing on TLC divorced In the Facebook ad about the Roloff family's \"sudden loss,\" the caption contained several grammatical errors. It said: \"Since the allegation were confirmed to the public, the cast of 'Little People, Big World' has ask for some privacy. Here is all the information given to the public so far.\" In other words, the ad appeared to imply that there were recent developments about a death that involved someone on \"LPBW\" or in the Roloff family.  This strange Facebook ad came from a page named P-15897-2.  The ad was posted on a Facebook page with a strange name: P-15897-2. It was described as a \"clothing store.\" However, the truth was that this was nothing more than a quickly-created page that was being used to profit off of tragic and outdated news. It was likely managed from outside of the U.S. One of the photos showed a young Zach Roloff in a hospital bed. The picture was a screenshot from a 2006 episode of \"LPBW\" named \"Zach's Emergency\" where he experienced a \"mysterious illness.\" episode The ad led to a lengthy slideshow-style article on foodisinthehouse.com. Its headline read: \"Little People, Big World: Learn the Shocking Truth About the Roloff Family.\" article However, the Facebook ad and this article were both misleading. The story was nothing more than an extremely long history of the Roloff family. It mentioned several tragic developments. Matt had a brother named Josh who died at the age of 34 in 1999. He had experienced multiple medical problems since his birth, according to a report. Additionally, the story mentioned the August 2021 death of Felix, who was Amy's dog. She posted about his passing on Instagram. This news, which was reported by People.com and others, was around four months old by the time the misleading article was published and the Facebook ad went live. There's no evidence that the family asked \"for privacy\" about either of these two past deaths, as the Facebook ad claimed. report posted reported by People.com The lengthy article also documented two unrelated, sad developments about Dr. Jennifer Arnold, the star of the former TLC series, \"The Little Couple.\" According to Chron.com, the show provided a \"deeper look into the married life of Dr. Jen Arnold and Bill Klein, who happen to be dwarfs.\" According to Chron.com In 2013, Today.com reported that Dr. Arnold was \"diagnosed with stage 3 choriocarcinoma, a rare cancer that began with a September pregnancy loss.\" reported In sum, an unknown person was paying Facebook to display an ad about \"Little People, Big World\" that seemed to indicate there were new and tragic developments. It said that the Roloff family asked \"for privacy\" and hinted with the words \"so far\" that more information was coming about a recent \"loss\" or death. However, this was misleading and appeared to be little more than an attempt to profit from past tragedies from two TLC TV shows. For these reasons, we have rated this claim as \"Outdated.\" attempt to profit Snopes debunks a wide range of content, and online advertisements are no exception.

            "The number stems from a misreading of a 2021 online survey of just over 3,000 individuals. "
        ],
        "justification": "A June 2023 Twitter thread from Democratic presidential primary challenger Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that began with a video of him performing pushups also stated an allegedly science-based fact  that the average American gained 29 pounds during the lockdowns of the early COVID-19 pandemic. There are several ways in which this statement is false. Twitter thread  First, Kennedy misrepresented the findings of the survey he cited. Second, that survey  even when read correctly  does not properly address the question Kennedy claimed it addresses. And third, published clinical data suggest the pandemic did not have a significant overall effect on weight and, instead, followed a trend of an increase in the average weight of Americans that has existed since well before the pandemic. In an email to Snopes, Kennedy conceded that this critique was valid. \"I appreciate you catching my mistake and alerting me,\" he wrote. The statistic Kennedy (partially) quoted comes from a 2021 survey conducted by the American Psychological Association. That study found that 42% of people gained unwanted weight during the pandemic, and within that subset of people the average weight gain was 29 pounds. 2021 survey APA's survey of U.S. adults, conducted in late February 2021 by The Harris Poll, shows that a majority of adults (61%) experienced undesired weight changesweight gain or losssince the pandemic started, with 42% reporting they gained more weight than they intended. Of those, they gained an average of 29 pounds (the median amount gained was 15 pounds) and 10% said they gained more than 50 pounds, the poll found. majority of adults (61%) experienced undesired weight changes When the pool of individuals you are looking at includes only people who reported gaining weight (and not, for example, the people who say they lost or maintained weight during the same period of time) the number is going to be significantly higher. Kennedy's claim relies on the notion that the only Americans that existed during the pandemic are those who gained weight. This same survey indicated that \"18% of U.S. adults report undesired weight loss, with an average weight loss of 26 lbs.\" same survey In response to our question about his use of this data, Kennedy responded to Snopes by email stating that he was in error. \"I made an error in describing 29 lbs as a national average,\" he wrote. The APA survey did not gather weight data on any individual. Instead these data stem from surveys carried out by the APA, Stress In America, that measure \"attitudes and perceptions of stress among the general public\". This particular survey, the Pandemic Anniversary Survey, was conducted roughly a year into the pandemic in February 2021. It had a sample size of just over 3,000 individuals: Stress In America sample size The Pandemic Anniversary Survey was conducted online within the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of the American Psychological Association between Feb. 19 and 24, 2021, among 3,013 adults age 18+ who reside in the U.S.  The survey questions were designed to identify perceptions of stress, not to quantify standardized measurements of weight. Reports of undesired weight gain, in this sort of study, are entirely self-reported. Even if used in good faith, such a survey would not be an appropriate gauge of actual trends of weight gain or loss in America. In contrast to the APA study and its 3,000 participants, a research paper published by the Epic Health Research Network (EHRN) analyzed anonymized medical data collected from nearly 20 million patients across America at multiple times before, at the onset of, and during the pandemic, as explained in the July 2021 publication: research paper These data come from Cosmos, a HIPAA Limited Data Set of more than 111 million patients. [...] Data are pooled from 128 healthcare organizations representing 640 hospitals that span 49 states and cover 19,573,285 patients. This includes 15,663,833 patients in the year prior to the pandemic and 14,922,615 patients over the course of the pandemic. Cosmos, its website says, is the \"largest integrated database of clinical information in the United States.\" Composed of anonymized clinical records, the dataset is a product of a software company that manages medical records in many American hospitals. Epic Research is an arm of this collection of companies publishing papers based on their Cosmos dataset. says many American hospitals In the study, the researchers found that an almost equal number of individuals gained weight as lost weight during the pandemic: found We evaluated weight change for adults during the pandemic compared to weight change for adults in the year prior to the pandemic. A weight loss or gain of 2.5 pounds, which we define as a normal fluctuation or \"no change,\" was most common, both pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. Nearly as many patients lost weight (35%) as gained weight (39%) during the pandemic. By utilizing data from before the pandemic, from the start of the pandemic, and from during the pandemic, the researchers were also able to compare rates of weight gain or loss year by year. As described in the study, the period of time from the onset of the pandemic into May 2021 brought slightly higher average body weight than the preceding time period, but this was in line with a national trend of increasing average weight: described The average adult weight over time has increased, as shown in Figure 3 [below]. The slight increase in the average adult weight during the pandemic period of less than one pound is consistent with the previous trend. Weight change patterns were similar regardless of age and sex.  Their findings also put the extremity of Kennedy's claim in perspective. The clinical data indicates that only about 2% of individuals gained more than 27.5 pounds during the early pandemic: only about 2%  Because no study actually says that the average American gained 29 pounds during the early pandemic, because the study used to reach that conclusion  even if interpreted correctly  is ill-suited for the purpose Kennedy used it, and because nationwide clinical data suggest otherwise, the claim is False.

On that final page was another misleading story on a website called Live Intelligence Outreach. The headline read: \"50lbs in 61 Days: New No-Exercise Skinny Pill Melts Belly Fat. Why Every Judge On Shark Tank Backed This Product!\" another misleading story The article showed a screenshot that appeared to be from a Fox News Channel television show.  This fake screenshot appeared on a Keto Burn pitch website.  However, this was also fake. This did not air on the Fox News Channel. One dead giveaway is that the font in the lower-third area looks amateurish. The email for the Keto Burn weight loss product claimed to come from \"ABC - Shark Tank\" and mentioned \"Inc Magazine: Shark Tank Shocker.\" Clicking the link in the email led to a page that claimed: \"It was the most-watched episode in 'Shark Tank' history when sisters Anna and Samantha Martin won over the 'Shark Tank' panel.\" page However, we found no such episode. People named Anna and Samantha Martin never appeared on the show. The scam article also claimed: \"The pair are the first contestants in the shows long duration to ever receive a standing ovation and offers of investment from all panel members. The sisters said they celebrated the success with champagne and cake when the episode wrapped.\" The story then displayed a picture of \"Shark Tank\" personalities with a cake, purportedly celebrating after an episode about a weight loss product.  This photograph has nothing to do with weight loss products.  However, this picture had nothing to do with weight loss products and simply showed \"Shark Tank\" celebrating its 100th episode. This was confirmed on the Getty Images website. The celebration had nothing to do with Anna and Samantha Martin, Keto Burn, or any other weight loss offerings. Getty Images website In addition to \"Shark Tank,\" the Keto Burn weight loss website also claimed the product was covered by The New York Times, \"Today,\" O, The Oprah Magazine, People's Stylewatch, and Redbook.  These publisher logos were misleading.  However, we searched the content of all five publishers and did not find any coverage of a product called Keto Burn. This was highly misleading. In sum, a scam involving unsolicited emails, \"Shark Tank,\" and a Keto Burn weight loss product led to an article that misled readers. We recommend readers delete such emails and avoid following links to such websites.",

            "The cast of \"Shark Tank\" never endorsed any CBD gummies or keto gummies, despite a lie that scammers have promoted for years."
        ],
        "justification": "One online scam that never seems to come to an end is the lie that the cast of the TV show \"Shark Tank\" endorsed, invested in, or provided reviews for either CBD gummies or keto gummies for weight loss. For years, scammers have used the \"Shark Tank\" name to push the false idea that the cast of the show invested in CBD gummies and keto gummies, even though no such episode of the show ever aired. No one on the \"Shark Tank\" show has anything to do with CBD gummies or keto gummies. In this story, we'll spell out everything we know about these scams. We'll also provide ways to fight back. Some readers may have seen scam ads about \"Shark Tank\" and keto gummies online, perhaps in Google search results or on Facebook or Instagram.Such ads also appeared in email messages, like the one shown below. These ads led to scammy articles branded with the logos of major publishers. However, those articles were written by scammers and hosted on scam websites. Here's how the seemingly legitimate-looking articles were created. Scammers copied the designs of various news websites in order to fool potential victims into thinking they were reading from the publisher's official page. In the past, scammers copied and used article layouts from ABC News, Fox News, Us Weekly, \"Today,\" People magazine, Time magazine, and others. The articles usually claim that various celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Ree Drummond, Kelly Clarkson, Tom Selleck, Kaley Cuoco, Melissa McCarthy, Wayne Gretzky, the cast of \"Shark Tank,\" or others all endorsed either CBD gummies or keto gummies, even though they had no involvement with the products whatsoever. In reality, the image and likeness of each celebrity was being used without permission. Oprah Winfrey Ree Drummond Kelly Clarkson Tom Selleck Aside from the scammy ads, we often see numerous fake CBD and keto gummies reviews that use the \"Shark Tank\" name. These articles aren't really reviews, however. They're paid-for product pitches that appear as sponsored content. Outlook India, Tribune India, Mid-Day.com, and others all appeared to be accepting money in exchange for sponsored content articles that named \"Shark Tank\" alongside many different CBD and keto gummies product names. In recent months, our reporters received word from some users who said they received bags (not boxes) of CBD or keto gummies products at their doorstep, despite having no recollection of ordering the products. Some also said there was no charge on their credit card. It's unclear why people who hadn't ordered or been charged for the products were receiving them in the mail. Many of these users said that the return addresson the package was for a nameless \"fulfillment center\" with a P.O. box in Smyrna, Tennessee, Tampa, Florida, or Las Vegas, Nevada. Typing \"fulfillment center\" into Google (without quotes) displayed the first search suggestion as \"fulfillment center smyrna tn,\" which perhaps showed just how many people were looking for help after being scammed. Unfortunately, more details about these \"fulfillment center\" addresses were not yet available at the time this article was published. It's unclear if anyone associated with these mailboxes or locations had any knowledge of or involvement with the scams. In the past, our reporters noticed that brand new CBD gummies and keto gummies product names popped up regularly, with no sign of a parent company or any other branding, as if such details had been omitted on purpose. It's possible that many of these products were the same and had simply been rebranded after previous product names received negative feedback. We also noticed that phone numbers on some product order pages for CBD and keto gummies are often missing or disconnected. Placing a call to any working number goes to a generic, nameless customer service phone line. When calling these lines, the person on the other end of the call declined to say the name of thecompany they worked for, nor would they give any information regarding the name of the apparent call center. One additional aspect of the \"Shark Tank\" CBD gummies and keto gummies scams, plus the scams that used the image and likeness of other celebrities, was that many users told us they believed they would be charged around $40 for their order, but were ultimately charged close to $200. From what we could tell, this information may have appeared in the fine print of the terms and conditions, but was not mentioned at all on product checkout pages. After having difficulties getting in touch with the phone line for the product they ordered, users consistently told us that they were offered a refund of 50%, something that apparently was a part of the call center's script. In 2022, \"Shark Tank\" cast member Mark Cuban tweeted about the seemingly never-ending keto gummies scams, where he railed against tech platforms that continue to accept money from scammers to allow ads to run that promote the scams. \"Does anyone really think keto pills work?,\" Cuban asked. \"Why would anyone take an ad for them with or without the fake endorsement? Where is the content filtering that we hear so much? If a platform can't detect fake keto or CBD gummy ads, can they really detect anything? Or do they not care that mostly seniors are getting ripped off!\"  The official \"Shark Tank\" website on ABC.com also once published a page about scammers that use the show's name without authorization. page \"The internet has become overrun with advertisements featuring products allegedly endorsed by 'Shark Tank' or the Sharks,\" the page read. \"Many merchants are using the names and images of the show and the Sharks in an attempt to sell their products. Unfortunately, with every new episode comes the opportunity for imposters to use false information to exploit the unwary. While many products claim to have been on 'Shark Tank,' that is not always the case.\" On the subject of gummy scams, this story would not be complete without the inclusion of two past court cases. In 2021, famed film actor and director Clint Eastwood won $6.1 million in a lawsuit after alleging that a Lithuanian company had used his image and likeness without permission to promote CBD products. won In the following year, Eastwood won another lawsuit, also pertaining to a CBD promotion. That time, he won $2 million.

            "An online article purportedly published by People magazine said Underwood had \"shocked everyone when she announced her departure from the show.\""
        ],
        "justification": "In November 2023, multiple Facebook ads were displayed to users that led to an article that bore the People magazine logo and claimed that Sheryl Underwood, the longtime co-host of \"The Talk,\" would be leaving the TV talk show to work on expanding her own line of keto gummies for weight loss. However, this was not true. Underwood has nothing to do with any keto gummies for weight loss, nor did People magazine ever publish any such story. Underwood was simply the latest person in a long line of famous people who had had their image and likeness used without permission to sell keto gummies. Further, this false rumor that mentioned Underwood led to a dangerous scam that could potentially cost victims thousands of dollars per year. a long line of famous people One version of the Facebook ad claimed, \"Producers are furious that she came forward.\" The headline in the ads read, \"Sheryl Abandons 'The Talk' After Confessing Her Trick.\" Two of the false Facebook ads that promoted the scam. These ads led to a fake People magazine article on scam websites including emperorsland.pro, sizzlingpear.pro, mindfulmovement.pro and chillytreats.info. (We were unable to provide an archived link to the article since scammers design these websites so that the scam version of the page is cloaked from prying eyes  that is, unless users specifically came from a Facebook ad.) This is not a true story, nor did People.com ever publish any such article. The fake People magazine article, which was nothing more than fiction and a scam, began as follows: Sheryl Underwood Confirms She Is Leaving 'The Talk' After Her Accidental 'Live' Confession On-Air... The host said that it was 'time for a break', but she may actually have bigger things in mind. (People) - Sheryl Underwood, the 60-year-old host on CBS's show 'The Talk', shocked everyone when she announced her departure from the show after 12 record-breaking years on-air. Sheryl, who has earned the reputation of being one of the most business savvy women in the industry, made sponsors (and CBS) FURIOUS. Why? Because Sheryl failed to disclose her new weight loss line to the network. Sheryl's new company is actually a HUGE competitor to CBS's current sponsor Weight Watchers because Sheryl's product is 90% cheaper and five times more effective than Weight Watchers's competing product. According to sources, CBS made Sheryl decide on which direction she was going to focus on in the future. Being so turned off by the reaction of the network and their power move she has decided to pursue her new weight loss line and dream. The scam article went on to falsely claim that other celebrities had joined with Underwood to promote the products, whether they be Belly Blast Keto Gummies, Total Fit Keto Gummies or other products. It is a fact that no celebrities have ever endorsed keto gummies that are purportedly intended for use in weight loss. Websites that promote sales of keto gummies for weight loss usually lack information about the true creators of the products and the source of where they were packaged. In the past, some consumers who fell victim to these scams told Snopes that the post office box numbers included in return addresses for the products don't exist. The rabbit hole for keto gummies goes even deeper, however. Two odd scenarios have been laid out by numerous victims of the scams, which usually involve monthly subscription fees often reported as being around $200 or more, or around $2,400 per year. Some consumers said that they never ordered the products but kept receiving shipments that they had no way of returning, due to fake return addresses. On the flip side, other customers said that they received charges for the products on their credit card statements despite never having ordered them, and then never received any products in the mail. Further, listings for keto gummies for weight loss on Amazon.com and Walmart.com often feature the words \"Shark\" and \"Tank,\" although not consecutively as \"Shark Tank.\" The two words are included in product listings on Amazon.com and Walmart.com so that any customers searching online for keto gummies with the words \"Shark Tank\"  after those same customers saw false claims that said the TV show's investors endorsed the products  would then fall victim to the scam and purchase the products based on the \"Shark Tank\" lie. Again, to be clear, no investors associated with \"Shark Tank\" ever endorsed gummies. false claims If any readers have been victimized by these scams, we recommend contacting your credit card company immediately, reporting fraud to the FTC and also searching the U.S. Better Business Bureau's (BBB) website to perform a search for the product name associated with the purchase on your account or the product that arrived at your doorstep, so that you can find the company or LLC connected with the scam. reporting fraud to the FTC website Liles, Jordan.

However, for more than a decade now, there has been confusion as to the precise wording of the quote. In 2011, following the killing of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, a version of the quote went viral on the internet. It stated: \"I will mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy. Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.\" Given that if followed the controversial killing of bin Laden, the quote spread across the internet at an impressive reach, especially for the time.

Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction.

            "A mother and daughter sounded the alarm over a Pantene product sold at a Walmart store. We checked out their claims. "
        ],
        "justification": "In late summer 2019, multiple news accounts reported that a Wisconsin woman had endured a frightening encounter with a supermarket product tamperer who, the articles said, had added hair remover to a bottle of conditioner, causing the woman's hair to fall out. On Aug. 1, the website Distractify published an article under the headline \"Woman Loses Hair After Buying Tampered-With Conditioner That Was Mixed With Nair,\" reporting that: article \nTaffy Jo Trimm [sic] and her daughter Ashley Rose recently bought this bottle of Pantene from a Walmart in New Richmond, Wisconsin. In a now-viral Facebook post, Taffy explains that the bottle must have been tampered with. Someone must have mixed in Nair or some other hair removal product with the conditioner because, when Taffy's daughter Ashley used the conditioner, her hair started falling out. In clumps. How horrifying is that? 'Attention New Richmond Wisconsin Walmart shoppers,' Taffy's Facebook post reads, \"be aware of shampoo and conditioner you buy there as my daughter Ashley Rose bought some two days ago and someone mixed Nair in her conditioner bottle!!!! As I speak she is losing hair and crying!! Conditioner below this conditioner [sic] is supposed to be white. It is an ugly pink color.\"\n Other reports went beyond the parameters of that single purported incident, claiming without evidence that it was part of a broader trend. The websites Popbuzz and Rare.us both published articles using headlines that stated \"People are Putting Hair Removal Cream in Shampoo,\" while one Twitter user posted a viral tweet that claimed \"people\" were mixing Nair into shampoo and conditioner bottles: Popbuzz Rare.us tweet Please check your hair products before you buy them, people are mixing Nair into shampoo & conditioner in the store smh pic.twitter.com/iCuDpZLpmL pic.twitter.com/iCuDpZLpmL  ???? ??????? (@shandiditbetter) July 30, 2019 July 30, 2019   We have been unable to verify the claim that the woman in question lost her hair involuntarily as a result of exposure to a substance deliberately added to a bottle of hair conditioner before she purchased it from Walmart. The details follow. The narrative began on July 28, when Taffy Jo Timm wrote on Facebook that her daughter, 21-year-old Ashley Robinson, was \"losing her hair and crying\" after using conditioner she had purchased two days earlier from the Walmart in New Richmond. Timm's post was accompanied by a photograph of a bottle of Pantene conditioner and a photograph showing what appeared to be black hair deposited in a shower:  Later that night, Robinson herself posted the same photograph of black hair, along with a brief account of what had happened earlier that evening: account \"... Got in shower, shampoo [sic] and conditioned my hair, got out, something was different and didnt smell the greatest. I carried on sat down for a bit and then decided to go blow dry my hair, I took my hair out of the towel and it smelt terrible, got back in the shower used my other shampoo and rubbed that in, as I took my hands out of my hair it was covered in hair and just kept on falling out.\" Robinson said she visited the emergency room due to a burning sensation and was later discharged. The following evening, she wrote on Facebook that she had undergone a \"consultation\" but had resigned herself to having to shave her head. On July 30, Robinson posted a photograph of herself bald, and on Aug. 1, Minneapolis television station WCCO interviewed her: wrote photograph  On Aug. 1, the New Richmond Police Department announced they had opened an investigation into potential product tampering after having received a formal complaint about Robinson's experience. Their news release on the subject stated that: news release \nDue to the significance of this offense, New Richmond officers and detectives have been working with Wal-Mart staff to identify potential suspects and review video surveillance. The New Richmond Police Department will continue to follow the facts of this case. While this appears to be an isolated case at this time, the New Richmond Police Department is asking anyone in this area that has been a recent victim of this type of activity to please report it immediately to your local police/sheriffs department. The New Richmond Police Department is also reminding people to be diligent in checking products for safety seals and prior to any use to make sure it is consistent with the product you are expecting.\n We have so far been unable to independently verify that Ashley Robinson's hair loss was involuntary and came about as the result of her using conditioner tainted with Nair (or some other hair-removal product, or any other substance) following an act of product tampering at the Walmart in New Richmond. If or when we receive evidence that would verify that sequence of events, we will update this article accordingly. We do know that Robinson experienced hair loss, and that she did indeed visit the emergency room at Westfields Hospital and Clinic in New Richmond on July 28, 2019. Her mother provided Snopes with a photograph of part of Robinson's after-visit summary. We have redacted certain personal details, but the doctor's summary clearly establishes that Robinson had experienced hair loss and suffered chemical burns on her scalp: \"If [she] develops further burning sensation please ... re-rinse her hair. You can follow up in your clinic regarding hair regrowth. Based on the appearance of her scalp, that will likely grow back normally. However, follow-up may be necessary if you're [sic] hair is not coming in as expected.\" The doctor listed the diagnosis as: \"Chemical burn of scalp, unspecified corrosion degree, initial encounter.\"   However, beyond this documentation, we have found no evidence that corroborates the claim that Robinson's conditioner was deliberately contaminated with hair-removal cream by a third party. Furthermore, we have discovered certain details that subtract, rather than add, support to that theory. Dispute over dates First, significant confusion exists over when Robinson actually purchased the conditioner that she believes caused her hair loss. In her original Facebook post, Timm said her daughter had bought it from Walmart around two days earlier, which would be July 26. However, Timm later told Snopes that Robinson bought it on July 23. And in its Aug. 1 news report, WCCO said she Robinson bought it on the same day as her hair began to fall out, July 28. When we asked Timm to clear up those discrepancies, she insisted that her daughter had indeed purchased the conditioner on July 23 and said she had asked WCCO to correct its reporting. However, a spokesperson for Walmart told us that a team of employees had extensively reviewed video surveillance footage from the company's New Richmond location and found evidence that a customer who appeared to be Robinson had, in fact, purchased what appeared to be similar conditioner two weeks before the onset of her hair loss, not five days before it. Walmart found no evidence of Robinson's purchasing conditioner there at any other time in the ensuing two weeks. Walmart also reviewed footage of the same aisle from before Robinson's visit and saw no evidence of an individual's tampering with shampoo or conditioner bottles. We again put this discrepancy to Timm, who told us she could not explain it and said she had been told by her daughter that July 23 was the date on which her daughter bought the conditioner in question. We also asked Robinson about this discrepancy, checking whether it was possible she had misremembered either the date of the purchase or the location of the Walmart. She told us she was certain she made the purchase at the New Richmond Walmart and was \"almost positive\" she did so on July 23. Robinson also told us that July 28 was the first time she had used the conditioner, meaning it would have been sitting unused in her home for either five days (by her account), or around two weeks (based on Walmart's surveillance footage). We asked Robinson whether any possibility existed that a visitor to her home during that time might have contaminated the conditioner before she first used it, and she told us she had not had any visitors during that time. The smell test Furthermore, Walmart's review of the surveillance footage found evidence that the customer who resembled Robinson had unscrewed the pump-top cap from several bottles of conditioner, smelling each item before settling on one for purchase. This is potentially a significant finding. Robinson, in her July 28 Facebook post, asserted that she quickly realized something had gone awry in washing her hair because she could detect the odor of another substance in her conditioner (\"something was different and didnt smell the greatest,\" \"I took my hair out of the towel and it smelt terrible\"). asserted If the conditioner did contain a contaminant (whether hair removal cream or some other substance) which smelled strongly enough at the time that it struck Robinson as \"terrible,\" it stands to reason that she would have detected it in the first place if she were \"sniff-testing\" conditioners in Walmart before she chose the one she purchased. We put this question to Robinson, who claimed that she had opened bottles of shampoo when she visited the store, but not bottles of conditioner. In a statement, Walmart told us they had \"inspected all products in our store, reviewed surveillance footage and found no evidence of tampering.\" The company removed no products from its shelves, despite Robinson and Timm's claims of product-tampering, and according to their statement, Walmart employees have \"attempted to reach out to the customer to discuss this further and have received no response.\" Robinson told us she had not yet contacted Walmart because she was waiting to meet with her attorney. Two different colors Significant difference appears to exist between the look of the hair shown deposited in the shower in Robinson's original July 28 photographs, and that of the hair shown in photographs posted later. The hair in the photograph below appears to be black in color, and some strands look to be relatively long:  By contrast, Robinson later posted three photographs of herself on Facebook, which appeared to show her with brown or even blonde hair, apparently shorter than the black hair shown deposited in the shower. Timm told us that these photographs had been taken in the hospital on July 28. This means that, according to Timm and Robinson's version of events, her hair appeared black when she washed it on the evening on July 28, but had significantly lightened in color within a matter of hours:  Timm also sent us a fourth photograph, which she said was taken on the day after the event. It even more clearly illustrated the change in apparent hair color that, according to the two women's account, took place:  Courtesy of Taffy Jo Timm.  We put those discrepancies to Timm, who told us that her daughter had dyed her hair and speculated that whatever substance was purportedly added to the conditioner removed the dye from her hair, as well as removing portions of the hair itself: \"I feel whatever was put into [the] conditioner stripped the hair color and removed big clumps of hair.\" Robinson told us she had dyed her hair dark brown two months earlier, but her roots sometimes appeared \"medium brown\" and \"even a little blonder-looking.\" The hair shown in the shower appeared darker than it really was, she told us, because it was wet. And the hair shown in the subsequent Facebook photographs appeared lighter than it really was due to the effect of the camera's light. Robinson later posted to Facebook a photograph of herself with dyed hair, which she said was taken the day before her hair loss began, and various photographs on her Facebook account demonstrated that she did indeed periodically dye her hair. posted We haven't been able to verify that any substance was added to Robinson's conditioner in the first place, or that the conditioner was the cause of her hair loss, placing doubt on Timm's hypothesis that a contaminant added to the conditioner removed the dye from her daughter's hair and led to a significant difference in hair color across the photographs. Furthermore, the difference between the apparent color of the hair in the first photograph and its appearance in the other four remains significant enough that, while we are by no means dismissing it, Robinson's explanation remains open to reasonable doubt. Finally, other elements are absent that would add credibility to the \"Walmart tampering\" account of Robinson's hair loss. For example, New Richmond police Chief Craig Yehlik told us that his department had received no other recent reports of product tampering of any kind in the New Richmond area. This absence of reports of similar incidents does not destroy the credibility of Timm and Robinson's version of events, but neither does it enhance it. Although not definitive, Walmart's internal investigation into many hours of surveillance footage yielded no evidence of product tampering at its New Richmond store, but it did reveal evidence that cast doubt on Timm and Robinson's version of events. It is noteworthy that the company has decided not to withdraw any items from sale at that store, despite widely publicized allegations that product-tampering took place there.

        "justification": "Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. here In late November 2020, social media users called attention to the number of Twitter accounts following U.S. President Donald Trump after his reelection loss to Joe Biden. Donald Trump Joe Biden One such tweet (displayed below) alleged the sitting president had lost followers \"for the first time\" and included a chart supposedly depicting that trend. such tweet  The underlying assertion  that Trump's account saw an unusual decline in followers after the election  is true; however, it is false to say the follower count had never dipped at all before, or that the number only increased or remained stagnant until late November 2020. Firstly, the number of Twitter accounts following @realDonaldTrump overall increased during Trump's presidency. Snopes created the below-displayed visualization of the trend based on follower analytics by Factba.se, a database of the president's public statements that uses automated software and archived screenshots to measure his accounts follower count over time. @realDonaldTrump Factba.se   Next, let us unpack the claim. Socialbakers, a software company that compiles social media analytics, apparently created the tweet's data visualization. The graph measured @realDonaldTrump's millions of Twitter followers between Nov. 16 and Nov. 23, when the account was a leading tool for the president's misinformation campaign to try to lower Americans' trust in the 2020 election as states certified election results in Biden's favor. @realDonaldTrump president's misinformation campaign states certified election results The graph depicted a steady decrease in followers over that time period, going from about 88.95 million followers to 88.90 million followers. Below is another visualization of the account's growth or decline in followers via Socialbakers over a longer time frame, between Election Day on Nov. 3 and Nov. 29.   Those numbers were indeed accurate estimations, according to Factba.se. Factba.se In other words, it is accurate to state that the president's follower account was decreasing from one day to the next in late November 2020. Per Factba.se, the president recorded an all-time peak follower count  88,964,791  on Nov. 17. Then, the following day, that total dropped by more than 18,900 accounts, and a daily decline continued with no sign of changing course as of this writing on Nov. 30. By that point, the president had lost almost 140,000 followers since the high point roughly two weeks earlier. (See the slight declines each day via Factba.se data below.)   That type of consecutive daily decline over the course of almost two weeks had not happened since the start of Trump's presidency in January 2017, per Factba.se's data.   However, it was false to claim that Trump's follower count had never before decreased. Between Jan. 20, 2017  the day of Trump's inauguration  and Nov. 17, 2020, Trump lost followers from one day to the next on numerous occasions, per the database. The net losses, which ranged in size, were documented on the following dates: June 15, 2017; June 29, 2017; July 13, 2017; Jan. 30, 2018; Feb. 2, 2018; May 25, 2018; June 9, 2018; June 28, 2018; July 12, 2018; July 18, 2018; July 19, 2018; Oct. 23, 2018; Oct. 24, 2018; Nov 4, 2018; Nov. 5, 2018; Nov. 9, 2018; Nov. 29, 2018; Dec. 7, 2018; April 24, 2019; Nov. 29, 2019; Jan. 29, 2020; Oct. 31, 2020; Nov. 9, 2020; Nov. 14, 2020, and Nov. 15, 2020. In other words, in four instances  July 2018, October 2018, November 2018, and mid-November 2020  Trump's Twitter account measured a follower count less than the day prior two days in a row. But in all of those cases, on the third day, the quick trend reversed and showed a net gain. That was not the case in late November 2020, when, as of this writing, the account tallied 13 days of consecutive net losses. We should note here: the data showed the total number of accounts following the president, no matter if they were associated with particular individuals, companies, organizations, or bots. The latter are run by programs attempting to spread content on social media without human involvement. Factba.se tweeted the following: tweeted   \"We don't analyze for bot behavior,\" the tweet said. However, \"small drops daily\"  like what the president's account measured in late November  were not typically the result of bots removing themselves from accounts, per Factba.se's analysis. In sum, it was true in November 2020 that Trump was losing Twitter followers from one day to the next over almost two weeks  something that had not happened since the start of his presidency. However, it was false to say his follower account declined \"for the first time.\" On numerous occasions, he lost followers from one day to the next. For those reasons, we rate this claim a mixture of truth and falsehood.    ",

Since it's conceivable that he published it then deleted it, we can't reach a definitive conclusion as to whether or not it is genuine. However, there are good reasons to doubt its authenticity. no record Firstly, it is strikingly similar to another tweet which was revealed to have been a hoax in February 2018, after another massive loss for the Dow Jones. On that occasion, Shaun Usher -- who runs the popular \"Letters of Note\" blog -- admitted to having fabricated an \"old Trump tweet\" from 2015, in which the presidential candidate was supposed to have proclaimed:  hoax loss If the Dow Joans [sic] ever falls more than 1000 \"points\" in a Single Day the sitting president should be \"loaded\" into a very big cannon and Shot into the sun at TREMENDOUS SPEED! No excuses!    Secondly, there is no record of the 2012 tweet existing before 11 October 2018. The earliest instance we could find was the purported screenshot posted on that date by Twitter user Travis Allen. Despite searching Twitter and online news archives from 2012 onward, we did not find a single reference to Trump advocating the impeachment of the U.S. president in the event of a significant stock market drop. Twitter Nobody made reference to such a tweet despite almost six years passing -- not even when the Dow Jones dropped 1,175 points on 5 February 2018.  Also, we could find no variances in screenshots of the purported tweet. Every instance shows the same number of retweets and likes, and the same set of thumbnail avatars. Additional screenshots displaying variations in the number of retweets and likes, and/or different avatars, would at least suggest that someone besides Travis Allen had taken note of the tweet and kept a record of it (although that, in itself, would not amount to definitive corroboration).  As it stands, the case for the tweet's authenticity rests entirely on a sole Twitter user (out of hundreds of millions) having taken a screenshot of it between 6 November 2012 and 11 October 2018, before it could have been deleted.  Finally, the person who posted the earliest known instance of the tweet has a history of posting anti-Trump \"sharebait,\" a fact that casts even more reasonable doubt on its authenticity.  Allen's own 11 October tweet implores readers to \"retweet and like to spread this old Trump tweet.\" This effort to garner shares and engagement is a common feature of his Twitter account. In the week leading up to the \"Dow Jones\" screenshot, Allen published nine tweets that included requests that readers share and like his content. For example:  Remember when Trump said he was going to build the Wall and make Mexico pay for it? ??? RT and like if you remember!  Travis Allen ?

(@TravisAllen02) October 5, 2018 October 5, 2018   A pattern of posting partisan sharebait does not prove that Allen's \"Dow Jones\" tweet was fake, but it justifies further skepticism about its authenticity.  We sent Allen a message asking him whether he fabricated the tweet, and, if not, whether he could provide the date on which he captured a screenshot of it, its URL, or an archive link to it.

        ],
        "justification": "Claim:   The outcome of Washington Redskins home football games has correctly predicted the winner of every U.S. presidential election since 1936. OUTDATED Example:  [Collected via e-mail, November 2012] \nDid you know....??  The Washington Redskins have proved to be a time-tested election predictor. In the previous 15\nelections, if the Washington Redskins have lost their last home game prior to the election, the incumbent party has lost the White House. When they have won, the incumbent has stayed in power.  This election year, that deciding game takes place on Sunday, October 31 ... vs. Green Bay.  Go Pack!!!\n Origins:  Our desire to understand and assert some control over the world around us is often manifested by our attempts to find predictive signs that enable us to prognosticate events  even when there is no seeming connection between predictor and event.  Sometimes one natural phenomenon supposedly forecasts another, as in the belief that a    groundhog's seeing his shadow on February 2 portends another six weeks of winter.  In other instances the linkage is between affairs of mankind, as in the superstition that the winner of football's Super Bowl augurs that year's stock market performance (or vice-versa). groundhog Super Bowl One item of this ilk which gained currency in 2004 maintained that the results of the last game played at home by the NFL's Redskins (a football team based in the national capital, Washington, D.C.) before a U.S. presidential election foretold the winner of that contest.  If the Redskins won their last home game before the election, the party that occupied the White House continued to hold it; if the Redskins lost that last home game, the challenger from the out-of-office party unseated the incumbent party.  And up until that 2004 election, the Redskins indicator had a rather remarkable record: Since 1936, the earliest  presidential election year in which the current Redskins franchise played under that team name, the team's results had currently predicted the outcome of 17 straight presidential contests.   Reality finally trumped coincidence in 2004, however: Despite the Green Bay Packers' 28-14 defeat of the Redskins at the latter's home field on 31 October, presaging a victory for Democratic challenger John Kerry in upcoming the presidential election, two days later incumbent President George W. Bush was re-elected, breaking the Redskins' predictive pattern.   The Redskins indicator failed again in 2012 as Washington suffered a 21-13 home loss at the hands of the Carolina Panthers on 4 November 2012, just two days before that year's election, but Republican nominee Mitt Romney failed to unseat incumbent president Barack Obama. defeat loss While we don't presume there is anything more behind the phenomenon than random correlation, the Redskins indicator can still boast an accuracy rate of 90% with 18 correct matches out of the last 20 elections:   \n After stumbling in 2004, the Redskins' power as election predictors got back on track in 2008.  In a Monday night game contested on 3 November 2008, the evening before Election Day, the Redskins were defeated at home, 23-6, by the Pittsburgh Steelers, a loss that foretold a change in party which would bring the Democratic candidate into the White House.  The following day, the Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, defeated the Republican presidential candidate, Senator John McCain, for the White House. defeated  On 30 October 2000 the Washington Redskins lost a Monday night game at home to the Tennessee Titans, 27-21, presaging a loss for the incumbent Democratic party.  Since President Bill Clinton had already been elected to the constitutionally-mandated maximum of two terms in office, the 7 November 2000 presidential election pitted Democratic Vice-President Al Gore against Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas.  In the closest (and most controversial) presidential election since 1876, Governor Bush gained the White House by the slim margin of five electoral votes, thereby fulfilling the Redskin prophecy. lost   On 27 October 1996 the Washington Redskins defeated the Indianapolis Colts at home, 31-16, predicting a win for the incumbent Democrats.  Sure enough, in the 5 November 1996 general election, Democratic President Bill Clinton won re-election over his Republican challenger, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. defeated   On 1 November 1992 the Washington Redskins lost to the New York Giants at home, 24-7, predicting a similar loss for the incumbent Republicans.  As expected, in the 3 November 1992, Republican President George H. W. Bush lost his re-election bid to Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. lost   On 6 November 1988 the Washington Redskins edged the New Orleans Saints at home, 27-24, predicting a win for the incumbent Republicans.  As President Ronald Reagan had already been elected twice, the 8 November 1988 election once again matched a sitting Vice-President, Republican George H. W. Bush, against a challenger, Democratic Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.  True to form, Vice-President Bush emerged victorious. edged   On 5 November 1984 the Washington Redskins bested the Atlanta Falcons in a Monday night home game, 27-14, predicting a win for the incumbent Republicans.  The next day, President Ronald Reagan handily defeated his Democratic challenger, former Vice-President and Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota, winning re-election with an electoral vote landslide. bested   On 2 November 1980 the Washington Redskins were trounced at home by the Minnesota Vikings, 39-14, predicting a loss for the incumbent Democrats.  As expected, on 4 November 1980 President Jimmy Carter failed in his re-election bid, losing to his Republican opponent, former California governor Ronald Reagan. trounced   On 31 October 1976 the Washington Redskins were spooked by the Dallas Cowboys in a Halloween Day home game, losing 20-7 and predicting a loss for the incumbent Republicans.  Two days later, on 2 November 1976, Democratic Governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia unseated President Gerald Ford (who had been appointed Vice-President after the resignation of Spiro Agnew in 1973 and became chief executive in 1974 after President Richard Nixon also resigned). spooked   On 22 October 1972 the Washington Redskins edged the Dallas Cowboys, 24-20, predicting a win for the incumbent Republicans.   The 7 November 1972 election resulted in the electoral vote landslide re-election of President Richard Nixon over the Democratic nominee, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota. edged   On 27 October 1968 the Washington Redskins lost a close game to the New York Giants, 13-10, predicting a loss for the incumbent Democrats.  Since President Lyndon B. Johnson had announced several months earlier that he would not seek another term as president, the November 1968 election was a contest between sitting Vice-President Hubert Humphrey and a former Vice-President, Republican Richard Nixon.  In a mirror of the Redskins game, the Democrats lost in a close contest (the two candidates were separated by a slim 0.6% margin in the popular vote). lost   On 25 October 1964 the Washington Redskins beat the Chicago Bears, 27-20, predicting a win for the incumbent Democrats.  As predicted, on 3 November 1964 President Lyndon Johnson (who had ascended to the White House after the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963) won a landslide victory over Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. beat   On 30 October 1960 the Washington Redskins were pasted at home by the Cleveland Browns, 31-10, predicting a loss for the incumbent Republicans.  President Dwight D. Eisenhower had already served two terms, so Vice-President Richard Nixon took up the Republican mantle against Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts in the 8 November 1960 presidential election.  Like the Redskins, the Republicans lost; unlike the Redskins, the Republicans made the contest a very close one. (Kennedy bested Nixon by a mere 0.2% margin in the popular vote.) pasted   On 21 October 1956 the Washington Redskins soundly defeated the Cleveland Browns at home, 20-9, predicting a win for the incumbent Republicans on 6 November 1956.  And, for the second straight election, the Republicans and their standard-bearer, Dwight D. Eisenhower, prevailed over the Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson. defeated   On 2 November 1952 the Washington Redskins lost a squeaker to the Pittsburgh Steelers at home, 24-23, predicting a similar loss for the incumbent Democrats.  President Harry S. Truman declined to run for re-election (he had already served eight years), leaving the field open for former Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson to stand against the Republican candidate, General Dwight D. Eisenhower.  The Democrats' loss on 4 November 1952 was not nearly as close as the Redskins' had been. lost   On 31 October 1948, the Washington Redskins walloped the Boston Yanks at home, 59-21, predicting a win for the incumbent Democrats.  Two days later, In one of the most stunning political upsets in U.S. history, President Harry S. Truman (who had assumed office in 1945 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt died shortly after beginning his fourth term) defeated his Republican challenger, Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York. walloped   On 5 November 1944, the Washington Redskins trimmed the Cleveland Rams at home, 14-10, predicting a win for the incumbent Democrats.  And win the Democrats did, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt secured an unprecedented fourth term by defeating the Republican nominee, Thomas Dewey, on 7 November 1944. trimmed   On 3 November 1940, the Washington Redskins thrashed the Pittsburgh Pirates (forebears of today's Steelers team) at home, 37-10, predicting a win for the incumbent Democrats.  Likewise, Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt became the first (and only) three-term president as he thrashed Republican challenger Wendell Willkie of New York (a former Democrat who had never held high elected office) on 5 November 1940. thrashed  Going back to 1936 puts us beyond the beginnings of the Washington Redskins, as that year the Redskins franchise was still playing in Boston. Nonetheless, their knack for foretelling the outcome of presidential elections was already in place.  On 1 November 1936 the Boston Redskins downed the Chicago Cardinals at Fenway Park, 13-10, predicting a win for the incumbent Democrats.  Two days later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt won  re-election over Republican Governor Alf Landon of Kansas.\n downed That is as far back as the streak goes.  In 1932 the Washington Redskins were neither the Redskins nor a Washington team: they were the Boston Braves, and they played in Braves Field, which they shared with the National League baseball team of the same name.  On 6 November 1932 they won at home against the Staten Island Stapletons, 19-6, a result that should have foretold a presidential victory for the incumbent Republican party.  Neither the Redskins' team name nor their predictive powers were yet evident, however, as President Herbert Hoover lost to his Democratic challenger, Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt of New York, on 8 November 1932. won Sightings:  This Redskins home game election predictor was mentioned in an episode of the AMC television drama Mad Men (\"The Wheel,\" original air date 18 October 2007):  Last updated:  7 November 2012\n",

Olive oil is a rich source of antioxidants and fatty acids that can reverse the damage caused by free radicals and prevent sagging breasts. Plus, it will help improve the skin tone and texture. According to the claim, topical application of olive oil either circumvents or reverses loss of elasticity in breasts. No specific reason was provided for the claim that olive oil, versus any other type of oil,could replicate the effect shown. The efficacy of topical treatments for sagging breasts or loss of skin elasticity is often discussed in cosmetic circles, thanksin part to the cost and invasiveness of surgical approaches. But research demonstrating any single topical ingredient can prevent (much less reverse) loss of skin elasticity is notably skimpy: notably Antioxidant ointments, creams, and lotions may help reduce the risk of wrinkles and protect against sun damage. Unlike sunscreens, they build up in the skin and are not washed away, so the protection may last longer. Selenium, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), and alpha-lipoic acid are antioxidants that can be applied to the skin. Evidence of their benefit is limited and more studies in humans are needed. More commonly used antioxidants are described below. Your dermatologist (skin doctor) can tell you which product is right for you. Research from 2012 indicates that anxioxidants could potentially prevent damage to facial skin, but evidence was \"limited\" and reversal was not referenced. Only 1.5 percent of olive oil contains antioxidants (and that fraction is not composed entirely of antioxidants). Other foods are described as being higher in antioxidants, but no memes recommended rubbing a berry paste onto breasts for firmness. Research overwhelmingly examined efficacy of topical treatment for facial skin, which lacks the weight and density of breast tissue. And although topicals designed for facial skin need only penetrate a few dermal layers, any product designed or intended for useon breasts would have to enter the breast tissue to \"lift\" or prevent elasticity loss (a far taller order). contains described A blog post written by Miami-based cosmetic surgeon Dr. Ary Krau directly addressesthe question of whether any specific topical substance (including olive oil) had ever shown promise to improve loss of elasticity for breast tissue in clinical research: addresses Unfortunately, no cream or lotion has been clinically proven or FDA-approved to lift the breasts into a higher position. Dont waste your money on any product that claims to improve your breast position. While genetics play a big role in breast sagging, there are a few things you can do to prevent it in the first place. Try not to fluctuate greatly in body weight; gaining and losing a lot of weight in a short period of time can take its toll on the breasts. Be diligent about wearing sunscreen on your chest and dcolletage area to protect the skin from the suns rays. Wear a supportive bra as much as possible, especially when performing high-intensity aerobic exercise. We contacted Dr. Krau's office, and a representative for the clinic told usthat no effective topical treatment appears to exist. A thorough search of related studies turned up no strong evidence facial skin or breast tissue could be firmed by topical treatments at all.

The superstar rapper, also known as Curtis Jackson was outside of the Glass House nightclub early Tuesday morning when the Lamborghini Doors on his Escalade slammed down on his left hand. Eyewitness reports claimed that it may have been a gust of wind, but some say the vibration from the speakers in his Cadillac may have cause the Lamborghini door to slam shut. Paramedics rushed Jackson to the USC Medical Center, where emergency room doctors tried to reattach Jackson's left hand. Unfortunately, the blood loss was too severe, and they were unable to salvage Jackson's hand.  The operating doctor was not available for comment, but the hospital did release a statement. \"Our medical staff performed beyond expectations in an attempt to prevent the loss of Curtis Jackson's hand. It's an unfortunate accident, and we hope to help Mr. Jackson through the trauma and\nrehabilitation,\" signed by the president of USC Medical Center.  Jackson's debut album, \"Get Rich or Die Tryin',\" sold over 3 million copies worldwide. He is signed to Eminem's Shady Record label under the Interscope umbrella. He has a new album slated for release this March titled, \"The St. Valentine's Day Massacre.\"  A comment from his label was unavailable at press time.\n Origins:  This   item about an accident in which rapper Curtis Jackson (now better known as 50 Cent) supposedly lost a hand to a car door and underwent (unsuccessful) emergency surgery to reattach the severed limb\nbegan making the rounds of e-mail inboxes in January 2005.

        "justification": "On 8 March 2018, the liberal Facebook page \"The Other 98%\" posted a meme reporting that 100,000 jobs at aerospace and airplane manufacturing giant Boeing will be lost  because President Donald Trump has reneged on the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran nuclear deal:   The claim that 100,000 American manufacturing jobs would be lost likely came from a Marketwatch report, which states: report Boeing announced the largest of its deals with Iranian airlines in December 2016: 80 jets for Iran Air  including 50 of the 737 MAX 8 model. In April 2017, Iran Aseman Airlines signed an agreement to purchase 30 Boeing 737 MAX planes, with an option to buy 30 more. Boeing at the time said the Iran Air deal would support 100,000 U.S. jobs. Dan Curran, a spokesman for Boeing, told us in a statement that the company expects the effect on jobs from the policy reversal to be \"minimal,\" if there's any at all: The production plan that we have put in place was not and is not dependent on the Iranian orders. Boeing has a robust sales backlog of more than 5,800 airplanes, which represents about 7 years of production. Iranian airlines were not included in our order backlog. And there has been no change to our backlog or production rates as a result of the Administrations announcement. At an event in Washington, D.C., Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company had planned for the possibility that the U.S. could back out of the agreement by not committing production slots for planes slated for Iran. event It's too early to know how blowback from the policy reversal will impact Boeing and the economy as a whole, as financial publication TheStreet.com points out: Bernstein's analysts said there may be as much of a chance for Boeing to profit on an Iran fallout as not. \"For defense contractors with significant Middle Eastern exposure, heightened regional tensions could drive increased demand for missile defense, in particular, but potentially also aircraft, ships, missiles, and vehicles,\" Harned and company wrote. [...] Various analysts, including Seaport's Sullivan and Bernstein's Harned, Laughlin and Sheey, were not overly concerned with Boeing falling behind on that production rate. The company has said it did not model the Iranian order into its production rate forecast for the 777 and the order was not part of its firm backlog of those jets as of April, which totaled 94. Any loss to 737 deliveries due to the Iranian deal would also be immaterial given the company had a backlog of 4,622 of those jets as of April. French aircraft dealer Airbus will also lose roughly $20 billion in business as a result of Trump's decision, because although the company is based in Europe, parts used to manufacture the planes are made in the United States. Among other large companies that stand to lose as a result of the decision are General Electric, Volkswagen, and Total, as CNN Money reports: reports Total (TOT), the French oil and gas company, signed a $2 billion agreement to help develop Iran's giant South Pars gas field, together with Chinese state oil company CNPC. Now the company is worried the agreement could collapse in the face of new sanctions. General Electric (GE) received millions of dollars in orders from Iran in 2017, according to company filings, for its oil and gas business. This includes orders for machine parts and equipment used in gas plants. [...] And in 2017, Germany's Volkswagen (VLKAF) announced that it would sell cars in Iran for the first time in 17 years.

The amount of calories burned by farting would depend on how long the fart lasts and how much energy you use to do it. Some people believe you can burn up to 67 calories by releasing gas. It should be noted that similar inquiries posed via ChaCha also prompted answers of less than one calorie, not very many calories, and no calories. less not very many no So how many calories do you burn during a single fart? Unsurprisingly, we weren't able to uncover much scientific research on the subject. But according to a post on the web site Fat Loss School, the number is much lower than 67: number Some people get a bit desperate when it comes to weight loss. They start wondering which of their daily activities burns enough calories to warrant increasing the frequency. We get questions about calorie consumption in a host of different scenarios.

When you fart, your muscles relax and the gas pressure in your bowels do all the work in expelling the gas. The only way you would achieve a measureable figure in the calories burned farting is if you really strained yourself to the limit.",

            "Has Jared of the Subway commercials died?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Jared Fogel, the star of commercials for the Subway chain of sandwich stores, has died.  \nStatus:  False.\n Origins:  Subway's pitchman Jared Fogle is alive and well, but so too are rumors about his demise. Because he lost so much weight so quickly and became a minor celebrity through the many commercials he has starred in for the sandwich   shop chain, this young man become the focus a spurious rumor that places him six feet under and pushing up daisies. Though this hadn't been in the plan when he started on the road towards a more svelte figure, Jared's dieting success transformed him into Subway's pitchman and goodwill ambassador at large. He started out just a guy who wanted to lose weight and who came up with an novel and effective way of doing so. As a student at Indiana University, Jared began his reduction plan in March 1998, when he weighed 425 pounds. His \"Subway diet\" regime consisted of no breakfast, a 6-inch turkey sub (hold the mayo and the cheese) with baked chips, and a Diet Coke for lunch and a 12-inch veggie sub (again, no mayo or cheese) with a Diet Coke for dinner.  He lost 94 pounds in the first three months; after he added exercise (mostly walking) to his diet regimen, he dropped 245 pounds within a year. His current 190 pound weight suits his 6-foot-2 frame. (He put ten pounds back on after he discovered 180 was too thin for him.)  In April 1999  the Indiana Daily Student (his university's newspaper) did a story on Jared's remarkable weight loss. The Associated Press followed with a nationally circulated article (as did Men's Health magazine) which brought him to Subway's attention. They called and asked if  he'd like to be in a TV commercial that would run regionally in the Midwest. And thus a fitness star was born. As to how well he's done in maintaining his weight loss and fitness goals since 1998, in November 2010 he ran the New York City marathon in 5 hours, 13 minutes. Jared is currently under contract to Subway, and in addition to the commercials he appears in for them, he makes numerous personal appearances both to tout Subway and to promote fitness. Celebrity death rumors are nothing new, as Steve Burns of Blue's Clues can attest to. (Rumors about that popular TV show's host death have been rampant for years, with his leaving the show in 2001 only adding to them.) In this case, however, they seem to be underpinned by an unvoiced conviction that all that weight loss can't be good for a person, plus some good old-fashioned sour grapes. Those who are struggling with their own weight issues or watching loved ones dealing with the same might find comfort in a rumor that the high-profile \"success\" they see on television every day paid for it with his life.  Steve Burns Most of the rumors about Jared simply place him in a pine box, with no explanation given for how he came to that end. Some, however, make the \"sour grapes\" aspect of the rumor startlingly apparent: \n\nThe current rumor going around Tulsa is that Jared of Subway Diet Commercial Fame has been busted for cocaine possession and the real reason he lost so much weight as well as his position with the Subway Restaurant chain is in question.\n \n Any truth to the rumor that Jerrod from the Subway commercials was fired after being diagnosed with A.I.D.S. because weight loss was due to illness?\n \n Did Jared the subway guy have gastric bypass?  Is that realy how he lost the weight?  He is making an appearance at the Heartwalk for the AHA in Mobile, AL. The rumors around town are that he had the bypass.\n In each of the three preceding cases, the college student's 245 pound weight loss is attributed to reasons other than successful dieting and willpower. Moreover, each of these explanations has a dark component that serves to erode his accomplishment: In one, Jared is a cokehead. In another, he has full-blown AIDS (which, in the world of rumor at least, goes hand-in-hand with an unstated presumption of homosexuality). In another, he's secretly had an operation that made his startling reduction possible.  Another \"sour graping\" component is also evident: the envied one's perfidy brings about (or is about to bring about) a loss of position, power, money, and fame. It's not enough that the truth come out  the person who has through his own success made others feel bad about their less-than-stellar results has to be brought down. Jared is \"found out\" by Subway, which fires him or is on the brink of terminating its association with him. In this form of the rumor, punishment  ostensibly for having gained something wrongly but actually for having caused others to feel less competent in comparison  is meted out. Nothing brings out the green-eyed monster like success. It's a sad truth that often those who accomplish something in this world attract not praise, but belittling rumors that say the one who succeeded doesn't deserve the adulation or prosperity good fortune or hard work brought his way.  Barbara \"petty cache\" Mikkelson Sightings:  In an episode of the animated TV series South Park (\"Jared has Aides\"; original air date 6 March 2002) Jared makes a public appearance in South Park to talk about his weight loss regimen and mentions that he lost weight with the help of aides (i.e., dietary aides, a dietician, and a personal trainer).  However, the townspeople think he means AIDS and try to force him out of town.

            "Mexico is in trade talks with Argentina, but no deal has been finalized; the cost to American farmers would likely be lower than claimed."
        ],
        "justification": "Two of Donald Trump's most prominent 2016 campaign pledges were to build a border wall along the Mexican border (or rather, to reinforce and extend it; a wall already exists along hundreds of miles of the international border), and to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, a 1994 arrangement between the United States, Canada and Mexico which he called \"the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.\" exists arrangement called In October 2017, left-wing Facebook page \"The Other 98%\" posted a widely-shared meme which claimed that Mexico had  in retaliation for Trump's border wall plans  signed a major agricultural trade agreement with Argentina, which would have very harmful effects on American farmers: meme They're trying to distract us from the fact that Mexico retaliated against the border wall by establishing an agricultural agreement with Argentina. Starting next year Mexico will be buying 100% of their corn, rice, wheat and soy from Argentina duty free. In exchange Mexico will ship cars to Argentina duty free. This will take away at least $13 billion annually from American farmers.    As of 1 November 2017, Mexico and Argentina have not signed an agreement like the one described by \"The Other 98%\", but the two countries have held talks about a more limited (though still significant) trade deal involving grains and cars. Furthermore, the main catalyst for the negotiations has been the uncertainty caused by Donald Trump's vow to renegotiate NAFTA rather than his plans to build a border wall.  The source cited by \"The Other 98%\" is a September 2017 article by Daily Kos, which reported: Daily Kos Mexico already retaliated against Trump and his insults earlier this year by establishing an agricultural agreement with Argentina. Starting next year Mexico will be buying 100% of her corn, rice, wheat and soy from Argentina duty free. In exchange Mexico will ship cars to Argentina, duty free. This will taken [sic] away $13 billion annually from American farmers.  It's not clear what the source of these claims is, but a similar meme appeared online earlier in 2017, which read: meme Mexico has retaliated against Trump's racial profiling and insistence that Mexico will pay for his border wall. Beginning in 2018, Mexico will be buying its corn, rice, wheat and soy from Argentina. Not America. American farmers stand to lose $13 billion. The ripple effect will be even more devastating. The fact that this announcement was made during Trump's Made in America week, is just karmic icing.  \"Made in America Week\" took place from 17-24 July 2017; we found no evidence of any deal between Mexico and Argentina being announced during that time period. However, talks have been ongoing between the two countries.  place In the spring of 2017, Mexico's Deputy Economy Minister Juan Carlos Baker made several comments in interviews about his country's negotiations with Argentina and Brazil. On 26 March 2017, the Financial Times reported: Financial Times Mexico, the worlds biggest buyer of US corn, is considering offering duty-free access to Brazilian and Argentine maize as an alternative to American imports in a move that could have big consequences for US farmers worried about Donald Trumps trade and tax agenda. [...] \"I am pretty optimistic about the possibility of having a deal with these countries soon,\" Juan Carlos Baker, Mexicos deputy economy minister, told the Financial Times in an interview. \"Were pretty far advanced with Brazil...Argentina is a few steps behind,\" he said.... The following month, Baker told Reuters that a deal with Argentina could be finalized by the end of 2017: Reuters Mexico, seeking closer ties with the rest of Latin America, expects to finish negotiations on a trade deal with Argentina involving cars and agricultural products around the end of the year, Mexicos deputy minister for foreign trade said in an interview on Tuesday. [...] Under the deal, Argentina could gain part of the lucrative grains market in Mexico, Latin Americas No. 2 economy, Baker told Reuters. In 2015 Mexico imported $2.3 billion worth of U.S. corn and $1.4 billion of U.S. soy. But Baker said those numbers will likely decrease under a renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement called for by Trump. \"The potential is there,\" Baker said. \"The Argentine exporters could find attractive conditions in Mexico.\" Mexico, in turn, could export cars to Argentina, he said. \"We have a very strong manufacturing industry and Argentina is an important market for us,\" Baker said. A trade deal between Mexico and Argentina may be in the works, but it has not yet been announced as of 1 November 2017. However, assuming a deal goes ahead to shift Mexico's importation of certain products from the United States to Argentina, the numbers are significant  but not as dramatic as they are in the meme. According to United States Grain Council statistics, the United States exported $2.5 billion worth of corn to Mexico in 2015 and 2016. In 2015, the United States exported $2.9 billion worth of soy products to Mexico, according to the U.S. Soybean Export Council (page 19.) According to Global Agricultural Trade System statistics for 2016, exports of wheat and rice were worth $612 million and $274 million, respectively.  Grain Council page 19 Global Agricultural Trade System This yields a total of $6.3 billion in U.S. exports to Mexico of corn, rice, wheat and soy  the four products specified in the above meme. So even if Mexico did decide to stop importing all these products from the U.S., the likely annual financial cost to the American agriculture industry would be extremely significant, but still only around half the $13 billion claimed. It's not entirely clear where the figure of $13 billion came from, but it might have originated in an October 2017 letter sent to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and signed by dozens of food and agriculture companies and industry associations, warning Ross about the dangers, as they see them, of withdrawing from NAFTA.  letter According to a study by ImpactECON, if Canada, Mexico, and the United States return to most favored nation (MFN) tariff rates upon any withdrawal from NAFTA, the negative impact on the United States will far outweigh any benefits from higher U.S. tariffs, including a net loss of 256,000 U.S. jobs, a net loss of at least 50,000 jobs in the U.S. food and agriculture industry, and a drop in GDP of $13 billion from the farm sector alone. The study mentioned here was an August 2017 working paper produced by the economic consulting firm ImpactECON. It did not actually mention any figure of $13 billion. Rather, it projected that over the course of two to three years after a U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA, real GDP in the United States would fall by as much as 0.09 percent. working paper Gross domestic product, or GDP, is the combined market value of all goods and services produced in a particular geographic area (in this case, the United States.) It is a calculation commonly used to measure the total size of an economy. Real GDP is gross domestic product adjusted for inflation - meaning, roughly speaking, the size of the economy in relation to the cost of living.  As of the third quarter of 2017 (when the ImpactECON report was published), the real GDP of the United States was $17.01 trillion, according to figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. A 0.09 percent decline in that would amount to a $15.3 billion loss  not far off the $13 billion posited by the food and agriculture industry, in their letter.  figures There are a couple of things to note here: firstly, the 0.09 percent decline estimated in the ImpactECON report relates to the entire U.S. economy, and not \"the farm sector alone,\" as mentioned in the letter. In fact, the working paper projects a very small increase in production for the crops and forestry sector (0.04 percent, page 20), accompanied by a significant boost to production in the sugar sector (5.11 percent), but it also projects production declines of between one and two percent in the meat, food and livestock and fishing sectors.  page 20 Secondly, this real GDP declined is projected to happen \"in the next 2-3 years\", so if the meme is using the letter to Wilbur Ross as the source of its $13 billion figure, it is misrepresenting the decline as happening \"annually.\" projected Politico. \"Full Transcript: First 2016 Presidential Debate.\"\r\n Politico. 27 September 2016.

However now that the clean up is underway in the region, deep sea creatures that live too deep to be studied are being found scattered throughout the wreckage.  These creatures were washed up on shore when the waves hit. Amazing what lives so far below the surface isn't it? It is ironic how terrible human tragedy and natural disaster can lead to unprecedented expansion of scientific knowledge.  The theory is the tsunami created enough vertical currents to sweep these deep living creatures to the surface quickly. The gases in their blood expanded rapidly causing death (like divers ascending too quickly). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  The same set of pictures was dusted off in April 2011 and attributed to the tsunami that hit Japan the previous month: \nCreatures Found At Seaside After JAPAN TSUNAMI Everyone knows, the tsunami in Japan was devastating, both in the loss of life and economically to the region. However, now that the cleanup is underway in the region, deep sea creatures that live too deep to be studied are being found scattered throughout the wreckage.

        "justification": "Claim:  Husband loses false teeth after prankingly swapping them with his wife's lost dentures. Example:  [Scott, 1981] \nThere is the story of the husband who was always trying to score off his wife. This went on for years until both were middle-aged people. Then on one weekend they went to the beach with friends for the day. Husband was a keen surfer still, and he persuaded his wife to go swimming with him despite the big surf running this particular day. The inevitable happened, and the wife was caught by a dumper and rolled helplessly up the beach. In the process she opened her mouth to shout and lost her false teeth, much to her dismay. Her husband went ostensibly to help her find the missing dentures, along with their friends who accompanied them on the excursion and, winking hugely at them, slipped his own false teeth out and pretended to find them. He offered them to his wife, who rinsed them in the sea and tried to fit them in. They wouldn't fit, of course, and to the husband's horror she flung them far out into the breaking waves, saying, \"It's no good, those aren't mine!\"\n\n   Variations:  In some versions a fellow loses his false teeth during a bout of seasickness while on a fishing trip, and his companion ties his own dentures to his fishing line and pretends to \"fish\" his friend's teeth out of the ocean. Origins:  Many a plot has turned on one person's losing something of importance, while others attempt to replace it with a hastily-obtained look-alike: a deceased pet is swapped for a similar animal procured from a pet store before the  swapped owner finds out that his critter has died; a woman loses a ring of great sentimental value, but helpful friends quickly secure a (usually cheaper) replacement from a local jeweler.  The typical denouement to such tales is that the recipient eventually catches on to the deception but is touched that others cared enough to try to make up for his or her loss. The \"Not My Teeth\" legend stands such plots on their head: Rather than trying to be helpful in replacing the loss of something important to his wife, a husband cynically tries to one-up her with a crude trick instead, resulting in his suffering an equivalent loss.

Amanda Haughman, a student at Cornell University, was able to drop 31lbs off her waist in 1 month without ever using a dime of her own money. Amanda is studying nutrition sciences at Cornell, and for a required research project Amanda thought it would be perfect to use university funds to find out how to 'hack' her weight loss. According to Amanda, \"the most expensive piece of it all was actually finding what worked. But the actual solution only cost about $5.\" \"I had struggled with my weight my whole life. I tried things like Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig, which just didn't work as good as they promised. I am a single Mom with a kid at home and I am also working towards my degree, so I don't have any time to be at the gym. When I was assigned this big research project, I saw it as a perfect opportunity to get a deeper look at the natural weight loss opportunities that are out there, and that is when I found out about combining Refresh Garcinia Cambogia and apple cider vinegar. The best part of it all, I can tell that my daughter is proud of me.\" - Amanda Haughman These reports included a number of false and misleading claims. For instance, the lead photograph purportedly showing Amanda Haughman's tremendous weight loss is actually Rachel Graham, who lost nearly 100 pounds in a year. Graham told Today in 2016 that she credited her weight loss to exercise and a healthy diet. Graham did not mention the alleged magic formula of apple cider vinegar and garcinia cambogia: Rachel Graham Today Ask Rachel Graham how shes managed to lose almost 100 pounds in one year and the formula is simple: Healthy food and exercise. No secrets. No gimmicks. No quick fixes. Shes also honest about the impact of going from 235 pounds to 144 pounds, especially the loose skin on her stomach, thighs and arms.  [...] I want people to know that it is 110 percent possible, Graham told TODAY. I used to feel as though it wasn't. That I didn't have what it takes, and that it was just too far out of reach... If you want to make changes, it is completely possible with healthy food and exercise. This weight loss advertisement also fabricated an interview with CNN and claimed that the network ran a segment on this Cornell student's \"amazing discovery\":   We sat down with Amanda to ask her more about how she found out about Refresh Garcinia Cambogia and whether or not that is all that she used to lose 31lbs so quickly. CNN: Tell us, how did you know where to start? Amanda: To be honest, I really didn't. I was given a budget for the project by the university, and I spent nearly all of it researching everything under the sun. I looked into other previous research, case studies, and even successful weight loss stories of others.   This story never appeared on CNN.  Not surprisingly the Platinum Beard post links to a site selling Garcinia Cambogia. The Running Evolutions article links instead to what is apparently borrowed content from Barry's Boot Camp, a personal training program. We reached out to Barry's Boot Camp for comment, but have not yet received a reply.  Although we can't speak to the effectiveness of drinking apple cider vinegar with Refresh Garcinia Cambogia, we can say that this text did not originate in a genuine news article. This is an advertisement that used a fabricated interview, falsified claims, and an unrelated photograph to sell a diet product.

The pilot managed to return and land at the Calgary airport. This damage was inflicted upon the plane 5 minutes into the flight after takeoff from Calgary. After managing to somehow bring the plane to a safe landing, the pilot ... QUIT!!! No shit, he basically got out of the Cockpit and said ... \"I quit !!!\"\nUnreal!!!  Last night circa 2300 our BAX aircraft flight 705BX encountered severe weather over Alberta Canada. The aircraft was cruising at 35,000 feet when it encountered tennis ball sized hail. The pictures below show some of the damage. All landing lights were destroyed, as was the radar. Amazingly, the engines continued to work. The crew was forced to make a \"blind\" emergency landing. Upon safe return to the ground the first officer and flight engineer quit. It is expected that the aircraft is a total loss as its structural integrity has been compromised.  The ol' Boeing Tri-Motor/Three-Holer made it through though.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n     Origins:  As usual, these pictures of a hail-damaged aircraft from August 2006 are a case of genuine photographs accompanied by descriptions full of erroneous details and exaggerations regarding their origins (as the First officer of the described flight disdainfully noted elsewhere). noted The essential (corrective) details are as follows: \n The aircraft pictured did not belong to BAX World, nor was it used\nfor flight number 705BX.  The plane was a Boeing 727-200 operated by Capital Cargo International Airlines which was en route from Calgary to Minneapolis on the evening of 10 August 2006 when the described incident occurred. BAX World Capital Cargo  The  plane was climbing from 30,000 to 35,000 feet (not \"cruising at 35,000 feet\") over Alberta when it encountered severe weather, including thunderstorms and large hail. The size of the hail that hit the aircraft cannot be definitively determined, as none of it was captured or penetrated the craft's windshield. hail  Although the crew declared an in-flight emergency and returned to Calgary International Airport, their landing was not nearly as dramatic as described in the accompanying text.  The hail put out about half of the plane's landing lights (not \"all\" of them), the radar was undamaged (not \"destroyed\"), and the crew made a routine landing (not a \"'blind' emergency landing\").  The damage suffered by the 727-200 was largely cosmetic (the craft was not written off as a \"total loss\"), and the plane was back in service the following month.  Neither the first officer nor the flight engineer quit his job as a result of the experience.\n Last updated:  21 December 2006\n  \n",

I don't know if U've ever watched Murder In Small Town X  . . . but the guy who won it (Angel... I forget his last name), who was a fire fighter, was involved with the tower rescue and is missing due to the collapse of the buildings . . . Is this true? I was a big fan of that show      Comment: I heard that Angel (?last name?), the New York firefighter who won on Fox's summertime show \"Murder in Small Town X,\" was among those killed in the World Trade Center tragedy.  Is this true?          I heard on the TV that the guy who won the money on 'Murder in Small town X',\na New York firefighter, was killed in the WTC collapse. True or false?\n Origins:  Many of us who watched the events of September 11 unfold on television felt a discomforting sense of disconnectedness.  We saw two airplanes smash into the World Trade Center,   and we watched as both towers later collapsed.  We viewed scenes of the wreckage where a third plane\nhad been crashed into one side of the Pentagon.  We heard reports that a fourth hijacked plane had been driven into the ground short of its target.  We knew that thousands of people were killed at the World Trade Center, hundreds more in the Pentagon and the four hijacked flights.  Yet it all seemed so unreal to many of us, in part because we had no tangible personal connections to any of the victims.  We had much in common with them, but they weren't our relatives, they weren't our friends, and they weren't people whom we even knew indirectly because they were famous.  We knew that their deaths were horrible and tragic, yet we had difficulty coming to grips with the magnitude of human loss, with the overwhelming grief felt by millions of people who lost parents, spouses, children, siblings, friends, co-workers, and acquaintances. One way we deal with that sense of disconnectedness is to try to find someone with whom we can identify  someone to whom we can put a name or a face, or with whom we can find some common bond.  For many of us that person was 35-year-old New York firefighter Angel Juarbe. Angel was one of ten contestants on the summer TV program \"Murder in Small Town X, in  Murder in Small Town X which players endeavored to \"track down a fictional killer from among the townspeople  mainly actors  in a mythical hamlet known as Sunrise, U.S.A.\"  Juarbe was the winner  taking home $250,000 and a Jeep for his efforts  of a series whose conclusion aired a mere week before the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York.  Unfortunately, Angel Juarbe, a Bronx native and a seven-year veteran of New York's firefighting force, was also among one of the first rescue units to respond to the World Trade Center emergency.  He was caught in the collapse of the first tower and remains among the hundreds of rescue personnel listed as missing and presumed dead. Here, then, was our connection.  Here was a person whom millions of us  even if only indirectly through the medium of television  had once seen walk and talk and breathe and laugh.  Someone who described himself to a viewing audience as \"stubborn\" and \"dependable\" and said he handled uncomfortable situations \"rationally and logically.\" Someone whom we rooted for (or against) for several weeks as he struggled to solve a mystery.  Someone whose anxiety we shared as he tracked down a killer while trying to avoid becoming a victim himself  even if it was all a bit of fiction created for our entertainment.  We mourn Angel, just as we mourn the thousands of other victims who perished that day, and we perhaps feel extra grief for Angel's loss because he gave his life attempting to save others.  And we feel an additional bit of sadness for Angel because, even if we didn't truly know him, he was our friend.

        ],
        "justification": "During the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in the spring of 2020, questions arose about protective measures. Social media users shared related images, and in one case, a newspaper column claimed that continual or prolonged use of face masks resulted in breathing too much of one's own exhaled carbon dioxide, which can lead to health concerns.  images,  one case, \"Dr. Dennis A Castro B\" wrote in the Nigerian newspaper Vanguard, for instance, that prolonged use of face masks causes hypoxia:  Vanguard Breathing over and over exhaled air turns into carbon dioxide, which is why we feel dizzy. This intoxicates the user and much more when he must move, carry out displacement actions. It causes discomfort, loss of reflexes and conscious thought. It generates great fatigue. In addition, oxygen deficiency causes glucose breakdown and endangered lactic acid rise. The post does not specify what kinds of masks cause these issues (though the article image does show N95 respirator masks), nor does it indicate whether this affects people with respiratory conditions more. It should be noted that hypoxia is a condition in which the tissues of the body are starved of oxygen.  hypoxia Another post on Facebook argued that prolonged mask usage caused hypercapnia, a condition arising from too much carbon dioxide in the blood.  Facebook hypercapnia  Image via Facebook.  Symptoms cause hypoxia But research articles and experts suggest that such extreme symptoms are unlikely to occur in most people. Dr. Abrar Ahmad Chughtai, an epidemiologist and lecturer at the School of Public Health and Community Medicine at University of New South Wales Australia, says the risk of hypoxia and hypercapnia are unlikely to take place with cloth and surgical masks, because they are not tight-fitting:  Dr. Abrar Ahmad Chughtai Some people with pre-existing respiratory illnesses (like asthma, COPD), may face breathing difficulty with use of certain types of tight fitted masks, called respirators. [There is] less chance of hypoxia as they may discontinue using masks in that case. Risk is very low with cloth and surgical masks as they are not tight around [the] face. He also argued that in the case of prolonged usage of any of these masks, \"Dizziness [was] less likely, but fatigue may occur.\" The N95 respirator is an example of personal protective equipment (PPE) usually worn by health workers to protect the wearer from airborne particles and from liquid contaminating the face. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend that the general public use these masks because health workers and other medical first responders need them more.  N95 respirator A team of Stanford engineers is developing an N95 face mask to counteract the side effects of oxygen deficiency. In an interview, John Xu, a mechanical engineer behind the effort, said: interview N95 masks are estimated to reduce oxygen intake by anywhere from 5 to 20 percent. Thats significant, even for a healthy person. It can cause dizziness and lightheadedness. If you wear a mask long enough, it can damage the lungs. For a patient in respiratory distress, it can even be life threatening. And their focus is on getting these masks to healthcare workers first. We are targeting this to anyone who has to wear a mask for the long term, first responders, doctors, nurses and even patients who dont want to infect others. In the near term, we hope to get these into healthcare workers as soon as possible. The general public is unlikely to wear masks for a prolonged period other than for short stints outside of homes, according to Reuters. A CDC representative spoke to Reuters:  Reuters The CO2 will slowly build up in the mask over time. However, the level of CO2 likely to build up in the mask is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it. Youmight get a headache but you most likely [would] not suffer the symptoms observed at much higher levels of CO2. The mask can become uncomfortable for a varietyof reasons including a sensitivity to CO2 and the person will be motivated to remove the mask. It is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia. The CDC recommends that the general public wear cloth masks, leaving N95 respirators and surgical masks to healthcare workers. They also offer exceptions for who should be wearing them: recommends exceptions Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. With these recommendations comes the additional guidance that face masks should not be a substitute for social distancing.  guidance The CDC also responded to Snopes about the impact an N95 respirator would have on healthcare workers:  Hypoventilation (deficient ventilation of the lungs) is a primary cause of significant discomfort while wearing an N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR). However, studies [indicate] that hypoventilation did not pose a significant risk to healthcare workers over the course of less than one hour of continuous N95 use. When healthcare workers are working longer hours without a break while continuously wearing an N95 FFR, CO2 may accumulate in the breathing space inside of the respirator and continuously increase past the 1-hour mark, which could have a significant physiological effect on the wearer, including headache, altered cognitive judgement, and increased breathing frequency, among other symptoms. deficient To fix the problem of breathing too much CO2 that has built up within the respirator facepiece, a worker can simply remove the respirator. Some facilities practice oxygen supplementation during these breaks from respirator use, but there really is no need for this as the oxygen in the environment is more than enough to relieve most of the symptoms listed above. The Vanguard piece also says it is dangerous to use masks in cars: Some people drive their car with the mask on, that is very dangerous, because, the stale air can make the driver lose consciousness. Chughtai said he believed such danger was \"less likely,\" and that running while wearing such a mask also was \"unlikely\" to cause breathing issues, unless the runner had a pre-existing respiratory illness. In all, little research has been done on the impact of masks on wearers, according to Chughtai. In some studies, participants noted breathing difficulties, but not hypoxia.  Ultimately, the impact of a mask on its wearer depends on the wearer's health, any pre-existing respiratory illnesses, the type of mask, and the length of time the person wears it. In most instances, the effects of prolonged cloth mask usage are small. Masks, like most short-term measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, should be worn only if the wearer has to be in close proximity to others, and be used in addition to necessary measures like social distancing, and more.

        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  The Boy Scouts of America has lost some funding over its refusal to accept homosexuals within its ranks. \nStatus:  True.\n Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2000] \n\n\nGood Morning,\nAs near as I can tell the following is a real concern and not a hoax.  The Boy Scouts need all the support they can get.  The request is to sign a petition in their support in response to the many funding sources that have withdrawn support due to the issue that was ruled on by the Supreme Court. Also many Federal Parks that now will not permit them to use that facility. You can access this issue at the following address. https://www.grassfire.net/index1.asp?CID=2&PID=70471 https://www.grassfire.net/index1.asp?CID=2&PID=70471 They also provide a series of statements of what has happened concerning the removal of support. Thanks for your interest\n Origins:  The petition quoted above began circulating on the Internet in October 2000.  It calls upon folks to electronically sign a petition in support of the Boy Scouts. (The Boy Scouts of America are not sponsoring this petition; an unrelated entity is housing and administering it.)  The petition (found at the Grassfire site) reads as follows: \n\nPETITION TO SUPPORT THE BOY SCOUTS!!\nAs a concerned citizen, I am deeply troubled by the recent attacks which have come against the Boy Scouts simply because the Scouts have taken a stand for faith and moral values. As a private organization, the Boy Scouts has every right to set standards for leadership and morality. The U.S. Supreme Court made this clear! I urge you to cease these hostile attacks against one of America's great institutions.\n\n Should you sign it? The answer to that depends on two things: What your views on the underlying issues are,  as well as what you think of the validity of online petitions.  We think it's not at all likely any Internet petition (no matter what issue it addresses) will have an appreciable impact on anyone in a position to affect policy. It's too easy to cook up lists of fake names and phony e-mail addresses and festoon a petition with them for anyone charged with gauging public reaction to be tempted to give such documents much weight when it comes time to make a decision. Petitions signed in ink in a variety of different handwritings aren't given all that much consideration in this world; how valid will a computer printout appear? A decision to support this petition should probably be based on what one thinks of the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to uphold the Boy Scouts of America's right to exclude homosexuals from its ranks. The Grassfire petition glosses the question of why support is being sought by saying nothing other than \"the Scouts have taken a stand for faith and moral values.\" This wording leaves those who weren't aware of the core issue in the dark as to what prompted folks to withdraw support from the BSA. We don't find that a fair way to write a petition. In a 5-to-4 opinion handed down on 28 June 2000, the Supreme Court decided that the Boy Scouts of America held the right as a private group to expel scoutmaster James Dale on the basis of his sexual orientation. The court ruled: \n\nHaving determined that the Boy Scouts is an expressive association and that the forced inclusion of Dale would significantly affect its expression, we inquire whether the application of New Jersey's public accommodations law [the statute contended in a New Jersey suit involving Dale] to require that the Boy Scouts accept Dale as an assistant scoutmaster runs afoul of the Scouts' freedom of expressive association. We conclude that it does.\n\n Grassfire expresses its view of the issues at stake as: \n\nThis summer, the Scouts won a hard-fought case before the U.S. Supreme Court called Dale v. Scouts. The Supreme Court affirmed the Scouts right to set standards for leadership within their organization. This apparently infuriated the politically correct cultural elites. Almost immediately, the anti-Scout campaign was launched, with the Scouts being branded as intolerant.\n\n The standard affirmed by the Supreme Court in Dale vs. Scouts, which recognized the BSA's right to determine how to run its organization, also applies to the groups who would now withhold funding from the Scouts: they too possess the right of association. Some local chapters of the United Way are guided by policies that expressly forbid them from financially supporting groups that practice discrimination. They have discontinued funding of the Boy Scouts of America because their entrenched principles  rule out this association in much the same way the BSA's principles rule out an association with homosexuals. It's the same issue, just the other side of the coin. At this point, only a few chapters of the United Way have withdrawn financial support from the Boy Scouts of America. Some municipalities are also now refusing to allow Scout troops to use municipal sites for camping and rallies. United Way funding to the BSA has not yet been substantially affected, however. A rough estimate of loss of beneficence over this issue places the figure at $500,000 a year out of budget hundreds of times that. (In 1996, for example, United Way funding of the BSA amounted to $83,743,000.)  As to what to make of the core issue behind the petition, it comes down to this: The Boy Scouts uphold their deeply-held beliefs by barring homosexuals from becoming scouts or scoutmasters. That stand, however, impels organizations who have sworn to refuse aid to those who practice discrimination to now recognize the Boy Scouts of America as one of the groups they must turn away.

The NYC Wire Fire Facebook page helped spread O'Connell's message by resharing his post with the caption, \"In case anyone comes across this ... maybe the thief is stupid enough to try to sell on eBay.\" Within a week, the message reportedly reached more than 8 million people and had been reshared hundreds of thousands of times. Unfortunately, despite the wide dissemination of this Facebook post, it did not result in the return of O'Connell's FDNY helmet. Facebook reportedly AM New York reported on 24 June 2015, a few weeks after the Facebook post went viral, that while O'Connell had not been reunited with his helmet, he did receive an outpouring of support from the community and two replica helmets from \"good Samaritans hoping to sooth the sting\" of his loss: reported Retired firefighter Michael O'Connell's social media campaign to retrieve his stolen FDNY helmet has gotten him the next best thing -- two replicas thanks to some good Samaritans. \"There are still amazing people in this world!,\" O'Connell said. O'Connell, 39, recently turned to Facebook to track down the significant memento that he wore at Ground Zero following 9/11 and hoped to leave to his three children. What came back instead were two painstakingly created replica helmets from good Samaritans hoping to soothe the sting of his loss and an avalanche of human kindness and compassion. \"I'm taking the good out of this story, not the bad,\" said O'Connell, who was forced to retire from the FDNY after being diagnosed with sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease that attacks the lungs and lymphatic system, in 2007. \"We live in an amazing world. So many people are willing to help. I hope people recognize this more than all the hate out there,\" he said. Although this FDNY firefighter's message was originally posted in June 2015, social media users have continued to share his plea on Facebook over the ensuing years. In April 2019, for example, a screenshot of O'Connell's message that was posted by the \"Ramsey, New Jersey Volunteer Fire Department\" racked up more than 600,000 shares. Ramsey, New Jersey Volunteer Fire Department When viewers learned that this message was nearly four years old by the time they encountered it in April 2019, they were left wondering if O'Connell had ever been reunited with his firefighter helmet. Unfortunately, that's not the case. O'Connell told us in April 2019: \"I appreciate everyones support in this matter. Unfortunately, my helmet was never returned! Hoping that it will make its way back home one day as I am a retired FF who has fallen sick to my work on September 11th and this was the helmet that I wore that day and throughout my career!\" Stepansky, Joseph.  \"FDNY Firefighter's Helmet Worn During 9/11 Stolen from Long Island Home.\"\r\n  New York Daily Post.  3 June 2015.

        "justification": "Climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions is a threat to the existence of polar bears that, if left unabated, may push many some groups to the brink of local extinction by the end of the century -- and thats under conservative estimates. More likely, research published in a July 2020 issue of Nature Climate Change suggests that most of the species will be extinct by 2100.  Nature Climate Change Previously, we knew that polar bears would ultimately disappear unless we halt greenhouse gas rise. But knowing when they will begin to disappear in different areas is critical for informing management and policy -- and inspiring action, said study co-author Steven Amstrup, chief scientist of Polar Bears International, in a statement. statement We found that moderate emissions reductions may prolong global persistence, but are not likely to prevent the extirpation of several populations, emphasizing the urgency of more ambitious emissions cuts. Amstrup and a team of researchers from Polar Bears International and several North American universities determined for the first time when polar bears are likely to go extinct due to a loss of sea ice, which provides crucial hunting grounds during the summer months, by analyzing 13 of 19 Arctic polar bear subpopulations, which collectively make up about 80% of the species. Other groups were omitted because of their remote locations, making them difficult to study. A framework was developed to determine how different weights of polar bears may make them better or worse equipped to survive longer fasting periods as well as the amount of energy expended during this time -- what they call the fasting impact threshold -- and compared this data with the projected future number of days that the Arctic is likely to be sea-ice-free based on observations made between 1979 and 2016. Polar Bears International By estimating how thin and how fat polar bears can be, and modeling their energy use, we were able to calculate the threshold number of days that polar bears can fast before cub and/or adult survival rates begin to decline, said Professor Pter Molnr of the University of Toronto, Scarborough.   Polar bears depend on sea ice to hunt seal prey, but in recent years declining levels have made it increasingly difficult for bears to feed. Sea ice is frozen ocean water that forms in the fall, grows in the winter, and eventually melts back into the ocean in the summer, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. But NOAA notes that observations in recent decades suggest that minimum sea ice -- that is, the lowest level each September -- is declining at a rate of more than 12% each decade since the 1970s. As sea ice declines, polar bears are forced ashore or to less productive waters and more time spent searching for food means that they are spending longer periods of time fasting and using up vital energy reserves built over the winter. National Snow and Ice Data Center NOAA Scientists calculated the timeliness of risk to determine how individual polar bear populations might be affected by two different futures based on greenhouse gas projections. If current greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate, a scenario colloquially known as business-as-usual, researchers project that all but a few of the polar bear subpopulations will collapse by the end of the century, leaving only those living in the high Arctic. Though moderate emissions will likely prolong the survival rates of some, it is likely that at least some of the population will become locally extinct within this century. business-as-usual By keeping global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, as was set forth by the Paris Agreement, it is still likely that most of the polar bear population will experience reproductive failure by 2080. Paris Agreement  Polar bears have long been seen as a bellwether, highlighting what might happen to some of the planets most vulnerable species in the face of climate change. A 2019 assessment conducted by the Polar Bear Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) found that sea ice loss resulting from climate change posed the most serious threat to polar bear survivals, but determining how and when the species may go extinct has been a challenge to the scientific community. Polar Bear Specialist Group IUCN Some polar bear subpopulations were further shown to be more impacted by environmental conditions differently. In the southernmost areas, total sea-ice melt forces local bears ashore every summer and they must largely rely on energy reserves from winter hunting for their survival and to produce enough milk for their cubs. The researchers add that their timeline projections are probably conservative and predict that many of the subpopulations will likely pass their threshold earlier. This is due to the high probability that researchers underestimated bears metabolic rate and assumed in their calculations that the large animals spend less energy on thermoregulation or growth than they do in reality. Environmental and physiological differences in bear subpopulations also play a role in how likely they are to pass their threshold sooner. For example, bears that hunt in areas like the Southern Beaufort Sea with fragmented sea-ice are likely to use far more energy than is gained by feeding -- a potential difference of up to four times more energy than bears who hunt in Western Hudson Bay, which the scientists note render their baseline timelines optimistic. The International Union of the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species lists polar bears as vulnerable and estimates that there are between 22,000 and 31,000 individuals left worldwide, up to 80% of which are found in Canada. Though some subpopulations appear to be rebounding, in part due to measures placed on historical hunting, at least four groups are experiencing population decreases. vulnerable Molnr, Pter, et al.  \"Fasting Season Length Sets Temporal Limits for Global Polar Bear Persistence.\"\r\n  Nature Climate Change.  20 July 2020.

Bush. \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, January 2008] \n\n\nSurprise, Surprise (not really) These are some rather eye-opening facts. Since the start of the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan, the sacrifice has been enormous. In the time period from the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 through today, we have lost over 3,000 military personnel to enemy action and accidents. As tragic as the loss of any member of the US Armed Forces is, consider the following statistics: The annual fatalities of military members while actively serving in the armed forces from 1980 through 2006: 1980 ........2,392\n1981 ........2,380\n1984 ........1,999\n1988 ........1,819\n1989 ........1,636\n1990 ....... 1,508\n1991 ........1,787\n1992 ........1,293\n1993 ........1,213\n1994 ........1,075\n1995 ........2,465\n1996 ........2,318\nClinton years @14,000 deaths\n1997 ..........817\n1998 ........2,252\n1999 ........1,984\n2000 ........1,983\n2001 ......... 890\n2002 ........1,007\n2003 ........1,410\n2004 ........1,887\n2005 ..........919\n2006.......... 920\nBush years (2001-2006): 7,033 deaths If you are confused when you look at these figures, so was I. Do these figures mean that the loss from the two latest conflicts in the middle East are LESS than the loss of military personnel during Mr. Clinton's presidency; when America wasn't even involved in a war? And, I was even more confused; when I read that in 1980, during the reign of President (Nobel Peace Prize winner) Jimmy Carter, there were 2,392 US military fatalities! These figures indicate that many members of our Media and our Politicians will pick and choose. They present only those \"facts\" which support their agenda-driven reporting. Why do so many of them march in lock-step to twist the truth? Where do so many of them get their marching-orders for their agenda? (These statistics are published by Congressional Research Service, and they may be confirmed by anyone at: https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32492.pdf )\n Origins:  What a muddle one can make of statistics. The item quoted above attempts to demonstrate that  despite the criticism of President George W.  Bush for involving the U.S. in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  U.S. active duty military deaths were actually significantly higher during the administration of his predecessor, President Bill Clinton.  However, the proffered list of statistics is seriously flawed, as it grossly exaggerates the yearly loss figures for years corresponding to the presidency of Bill Clinton and under reports them for the years corresponding to the presidency of George W. Bush.  The numbers reproduced in this piece were taken from a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report on American War and Military Operations Casualties, using Table 4 on page 10, that presents statistics for U.S. active duty military deaths for the period 1980-2006. (Table 5, which separates combat/operational losses from deaths due to other causes  accident, homicide, illness, suicide  would have been a better source, but since the item quoted above used Table 4 to document its claim, so do we here.) report We find the following totals in that CRS report: \n\nYear\nPresident\nDeaths\nTotal during presidency\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n1980\nJimmy Carter\n2,392\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n1981\nRonald Reagan\n2,380\n\n  \n1982\nRonald Reagan\n2,319\n\n  \n1983\nRonald Reagan\n2,465\n\n  \n1984\nRonald Reagan\n1,999\n\n  \n1985\nRonald Reagan\n2,252\n\n  \n1986\nRonald Reagan\n1,984\n\n  \n1987\nRonald Reagan\n1,983\n\n  \n1988\nRonald Reagan\n1,819\n\n  \n\n\n\n17,201\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n1989\nGeorge H.W.

Bush's presidency, the total number of U.S. military losses that have occurred during his administration is already significantly higher than the equivalent figure for Bill Clinton's presidency (8,792 vs. 7,500).   When active duty deaths for 2007 and 2008 are factored in (the Pentagon has not yet released figures for these two years, but the U.S. suffered 1,014 war deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2007 and at least another 100 so far in 2008), the discrepancy is even greater. When we consider all the information in this table, we also find that the number of active duty losses during the Clinton presidency was less than half the number that occurred during the Reagan presidency, and only about 20% higher than the number that occurred during the George H.W. Bush presidency (even though Clinton served as president for twice as long as the elder Bush).\n Last updated:  26 March 2008\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   Vinch, Chuck.  \"E-Mail on Military Deaths Is Shaky on Facts.\"\n   Army Times.  25 March 2008.\n\n",

        "justification": "Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. here Facing Democratic rival U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris for a debate in October 2020, Vice President Mike Pence attempted to give credit to his boss, President Donald Trump, for developing policies that rebounded the economy after unprecedented losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic In particular, Pence said the U.S. workforce added millions of jobs since the early days of the outbreak because of Trump's fiscal and regulatory policies. He said: We're going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we've already added back 11.6 million jobs, because we had a president who cut taxes, rolled back regulation and unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade. [...] We literally have spared no expense to help the American people and the American worker through this. In other words, he claimed the Trump administration spearheaded a variety of initiatives that added 11.6 million jobs in summer and fall 2020, regaining nearly half the roughly 22 million jobs lost at the start of the pandemic. The comment echoed multiple statements by Trump in which he, too, attempted to praise the administration's successful balance of public health and economic interests. \"Our strategy to kill the China virus has focused on protecting those at greatest risk while allowing younger and healthy Americans to safety return to work and safely return to school,\" he said in August. \"We added 1.8 million new jobs in July, exceeding predictions for the third month in a row, and adding a total of over 9.3 million jobs since May.\" said To determine the legitimacy of such assertions, we referred to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) \"seasonally adjusted nonfarm payroll,\" which is the standard measurement for determining how U.S. wage and salary jobs change over time. The payroll data are compiled monthly via a survey of about 145,000 businesses and government agencies across the country, excluding people who are self-employed, or work for farms or private households. compiled When a news story stated that, for instance, the economy added \"661,000 new workers,\" that number was typically a reference to the month-to-month change in nonfarm payrolls  661,000 more jobs were added in September compared to August 2020. 661,000 new workers We obtained monthly nonfarm payroll data, which showed:   According to our analysis of the month-by-month statistics, the economy tallied almost 1.4 million less jobs in March compared to February. Then, the recession deepened, and April recorded 20.8 million less jobs than the month prior  the steepest decline since the Great Depression. since While Pence did not provide an explanation for his labor statistics at the debate, we assumed he was referencing the sum of job losses in March and April, showing employers cut about 22 million jobs during those two months, per the BLS data. Then, after that, the country started a slow, steady recovery. The data show the following increases in job totals, all approximations, on a month-by-month basis: (We should note here: The monthly employment figures for August and September 2020 were both preliminary and subject to revision, as of this writing.) Looking at the data, yes, about 11.4 millions jobs were added to the U.S. economy between May and September  and the Trump administration's comments about the economy showing significant job growth since the early weeks of the pandemic were true at face value. However, that upward trend had little to do with the White House and everything to do with how businesses on a grand scale adapted to new rules on social distancing to curb the spread of the deadly virus. In March, for instance, California issued the first statewide \"stay at home order\" and New York City closed all non-essential businesses  both decisions that contributed to April's historic job loss. March Then, over the weeks, employers developed plans for operating under public health officials' recommendations to curb the spread of COVID-19 and, as a result, were able to bring back workers who had been furloughed or reopen after a temporary shut down. Those trends significantly impacted job growth in the U.S.  not Trump.  Additionally, a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan  which was developed by Congress, not the White House, via the March Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act  helped some small businesses bring back lost positions or keep workers who would otherwise have been laid off. That stimulus packages direct payments to Americans who earned 75,000 annually or less (or families that made up to $150,000 annually) may have also driven spending in the summer months and, consequently, kept some employers afloat after initial shock to their profits earlier in the year. Paycheck Protection Program Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act stimulus package All of that said, no evidence showed that the Trump administration enacted policies  whether related to taxes or trade  that \"added back\" the jobs but rather economic trends shifted from the early days of the outbreak, during mass furloughs and business closures. Here's the bottom line: Presidential administrations often exaggerate their influence on the economy  especially when employment is showing somewhat positive signs  no matter if they're leading the country during a crisis like the COVID-19 outbreak or comparatively normal times. As Neil Irwin wrote for The New York Times in January 2017, just days before Trumps inauguration: wrote The reality is that presidents have far less control over the economy than you might imagine. Presidential economic records are highly dependent on the dumb luck of where the nation is in the economic cycle. And the White House has no control over the demographic and technological forces that influence the economy.  Additionally, the White House had little influence on how businesses quickly adapted recommendations by public health officials to safely operate during the pandemic.  For those reasons, we rate this claim a \"Mixture\" of truth and falsehoods. It was true that the country added back about half of the jobs lost during the early months of the pandemic, though it was a false misinterpretation of economic conditions to tie that job growth to Trump policies  or that he \"cut taxes, rolled back regulation and unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade,\" like Pence alleged, and that those moves directly added jobs.

            "Photos purportedly show a mother tiger at a California zoo who nursed a group of piglets after her own cubs died."
        ],
        "justification": "As often happens, an item about a tiger's nursing piglets appears to be a case in which someone came across some unusual photographs with no explanatory context and decided to make up his own background story. The pictures are real, but the accompanying explanation about a mother tiger in California being given piglets to ease her through a depression stemming from the loss of her own cubs is nothing but fiction: In a zoo in California, a mother tiger gave birth to a rare set of triplet tiger cubs. Unfortunately, due to complications in the pregnancy, the cubs were born prematurely and due to their tiny size, they died shortly after birth. The mother tiger after recovering from the delivery, suddenly started to decline in health, although physically she was fine. The veterinarians felt that the loss of her litter had caused the tigress to fall into a depression. The doctors decided that if the tigress could surrogate another mother's cubs, perhaps she would improve. After checking with many other zoos across the country, The depressing news was that there were no tiger cubs of the right age to introduce to the mourning mother. The veterinarians decided to try something that had never been tried in a zoo environment. Sometimes a mother of one species will take on the care of a different species. The only \"orphans\" that could be found quickly, were a litter of wiener pigs. The zoo keepers and vets wrapped the piglets in tiger skin and placed the babies around the mother tiger. Would they become cubs or pork chops? Take a look ...   These pictures were actually taken in 2004 not in California, but at the Sriracha Tiger Zoo in Chonburi, Thailand. Although the Sriracha Tiger Zoo hosted one of the world's most successful tiger breeding programs, unlike most western zoos it also offered circus- and carnival-like shows, exhibits, and interactions, including (as evidenced here) the mixture of adults and young of quite different species in the same enclosures, as described by the AWI Quarterly, a publication of the Animal Welfare Institute: Sriracha Tiger Zoo AWI Quarterly The Sriracha Tiger Zoo, an hour outside of Bangkok, Thailand, is truly an amazing place. Boasting more than 400 tigers, a handful of Asian elephants, piles of crocodiles, camels, snakes and other exotic animals, the zoo has some intriguing, yet troubling exhibits. In one glass room, a farrowing crate entombed a pig who, lying on her side, nourished both her piglets and tiger cubs. Across the hall, another glass room housed a female tiger, who fed piglets adorned in tiger-print costumes. This incongruous display was replicated elsewhere, where enclosures housed tigers, pigs, and dogs together. In another area, a visitor could feed milk to a young tiger resting on his or her lap  a young tiger still in possession of his claws ... There was a tiger circus, not dissimilar from a circus anywhere else: tigers leaping through rings of fire, walking across a double tightrope, parading around the ring on hind legs, and riding around on the back of the horse. The mixture of tiger and piglets depicted in these images therefore was not something undertaken for functional reasons, but rather as a common form of visual entertainment provided by the zoo for the amusement of its visitors. According to the Pattaya Mail, these tiger-pig nursing relationships have also been reciprocated to the extent that the mother tiger shown suckling piglets was herself nursed by a sow: Pattaya Mail Visitors recently witnessed some bizarre feeding habits of the zoo's most famous inhabitants. A two-year-old female pig named Benjamaj is a blended pedigree of parents, Land-Less and Las-White, that were imported from Norway. Benjamaj is a kind and maternal porky. She has taken 4 baby tigers under her care and along with 3 tiny piglets is nursing the tigers as though she were their mum. She loves those cats and they love her back. Unbelieving, wide-eyed tourists pressed their noses up to the cage to get a better look. As they moved on to the next cage they were in for another surprise, as there, a great Royal Bengal tigress was lolling on her side and suckling 6 tiny piglets. 'Momma' tiger Saimai is two years old and as a baby was suckled by a pig until she was 4 months old. This democratic start in life allowed her to form a loving relationship with other pigs and even a dog. Food in the wild, maybe  but at the zoo, tourists who witness these amazing scenes come away with food for thought. Although these pictures might appear charming and innocent, the AWI noted back in 2004 that there may be a darker side to the Sriracha Tiger Zoo, as press reports stated that Sriracha was under investigation for illegally breeding protected wildlife for commercial export and had been implicated in the sale of a hundred tigers to China (where there is strong demand for tiger body parts for use in traditional Chinese medicines). The AWI also noted that in late 2004 the zoo was closed for a month when between 80 and 100 tigers died or were euthanized due to an avian influenza (probably spread via the raw chicken carcasses fed to the tigers) that swept through the facility.

        "justification": "Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. here One of the many claims U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly made in his futile attempt to overturn his loss to Democratic rival Joe Biden in the 2020 general election was to assert that his own popular vote total was indicative of a \"rigged election.\" How could he possibly have lost in 2020, Trump reasoned, when he received some 11 million votes more than he did in 2016, when he won?  \"Perhaps the biggest difference between 2016 and 2020 is @FoxNews, despite the fact that I went from 63,000,000 Votes to 75,000,000 Votes, a record 12,000,000 Vote increase. Obama went down 3,000,000 Votes, and won. Rigged Election!!!\" The answer to this question is a simple one: Neither the voting-age population of the U.S., nor the percentage of that population that actually turns out to vote, is a constant. Those figures can -- and do -- vary widely from election to election. It is true that former U.S. President Barack Obama won reelection in 2012, despite garnering some 3.5 million fewer votes that year than he did when he was initially elected in 2008. Why? Largely because some 2.2 million fewer people turned out to vote in 2012 than in 2008. (Obama still received well over 50% of the popular vote in both years, nonetheless.) 2012 2008 And it is true that Trump was elected President in 2016 after receiving about 63 million votes, yet lost his reelection bid in 2020 despite receiving over 11 million more votes than he had in the previous election. How did this happen? For two very important (and obvious) reasons that Trump consistently overlooks or ignores: 2016 2020 1) Voter turnout skyrocketed between 2016 and 2020, rising from 55.7% of eligible voters in the former year to 66.7% in the latter -- a difference of some 22 million additional voters. So even though the increased turnout brought Trump an additional 11 million votes, it also brought another 11 million votes cast for someone other than him. 2) Popular vote doesn't determine the election winner; electoral votes do. Trump won the presidency in 2016 despite receiving some 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton nationwide, because he managed to pull of narrow victories in three key states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. In 2020, however, Trump's popular vote deficit was over twice as large as the previous election (he received some 7 million fewer votes than winner Joe Biden), and, more crucially, he lost all three of the key states he had managed to capture in 2016 as they flipped back to blue:  The fact that far fewer voters cast their ballots for third-party candidates in 2020 than in 2016 also seems to have worked against Trump, as his Democratic opponent in 2020 (Biden) tallied over 15 million more votes than his Democratic opponent in 2016 (Clinton) had -- a figure constituting far more than half of the 22 million additional ballots cast in 2020 over 2016.",

        "justification": "Why no rating on this article? This is a trending topic but has not yet been rated by Snopes for reasons well outline below.\r\n On April 8, 2021, former NFL player Phillip Adams allegedly shot and killed five people in South Carolina before taking his own life. As this news began to circulate online, many people speculated that the former cornerback had suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive brain disease associated with repeated traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). Phillip Adams   WCNC reported: reported The father of a former NFL player who is the suspect in a mass shooting that left prominent Rock Hill Dr. Robert Lesslie and four other people dead said his son took his own life after shooting six people in York County, South Carolina, Wednesday. Alonzo Adams, the father of Phillip Adams, a former NFL player and college football star at South Carolina State, said his son shot six people, killing five, before taking his own life. \"I can say he's a good kid,\" Alonzo Adams said. \"I think the football messed him up.\" While many people may be asking if Adams had CTE, this question is not answerable at this time. According to the Concussion Foundation, CTE can only currently be diagnosed by examining brain tissue after death. The Concussion Foundation writes: writes Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed after death through brain tissue analysis. Doctors with a specialty in brain diseases slice brain tissue and use special chemicals to make the abnormal tau protein visible. They then systematically search areas of the brain for tau in the unique pattern specific to CTE. The process can take several months to complete, and the analysis is not typically performed as a part of a normal autopsy. In fact, until recently there were relatively few doctors who knew how to diagnose CTE. Currently, the claims that Adams had CTE are just speculation. However, it's not an assumption that is pulled out of thin air. In 2017, researchers at Boston University examined the brains of 111 deceased NFL players and found evidence of CTE in 110 of those samples.  The New York Times reported at the time: New York Times Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist, has examined the brains of 202 deceased football players. A broad survey of her findings was published on Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Of the 202 players, 111 of them played in the N.F.L.  and 110 of those were found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., the degenerative disease believed to be caused by repeated blows to the head. C.T.E. causes myriad symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, depression and dementia. The problems can arise years after the blows to the head have stopped. This study did not show a definitive cause for CTE, a brain disease that is characterized by memory loss, confusion, personality changes, and erratic behavior, and it should be noted that the brain samples involved in this study were donated by the families of NFL players who had suspected the deceased suffered from CTE.  Boston University noted some of the limitations in their study, writing: writing The study has several important limitations, most notably the lack of a control group, and selection bias in the brain collection itselffamilies of players with symptoms of CTE are far more likely to donate brains to research than those without signs of the disease. Despite these limitations, researchers note that the studythe largest and most methodologically rigorous CTE case series ever publishedoffers important information and direction for further research. The fact that we were able to gather so many instances of a disease that was previously considered quite rare, in eight years, speaks volumes, says corresponding author Ann McKee, a MED professor of neurology and pathology and director of BUs CTE Center. Theres just no way that would be possible if this disease were truly rare. Adams played in the NFL for five years. His professional career started in 2010 with the San Francisco 49ers, and ended in 2015 with the Atlanta Falcons. While not a comprehensive list of Adams' injuries, it's worth noting that Adams was listed as \"questionable\" or \"limited\" for two games during the 2012 season due to a concussion: questionable limited   As of this writing, it's not possible to say whether or not Phillip Adams suffered from CTE. If that determination is made, it will be by a medical examiner after an autopsy. We will update this article with a traditional Snopes rating if and when more information becomes available.",

THESE PHOTOS ARE FROM A SAILOR WHO WAS ON THE USS QUAPAW ATF-11O. INTERESTING, I THINK THEY'RE SPECTACULAR.                    On Sunday, December 7th, 1941 the Japanese empire launched a surprise attack against the U.S. Forces stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. By planning his attack on a Sunday, the Japanese commander Admiral Nagumo, hoped to catch the entire fleet in port. As luck would have it, the Aircraft Carriers and one of the Battleships were not in port. (The USS Enterprise was returning from Wake Island, where it had just delivered some aircraft. The USS Lexington was ferrying aircraft to Midway, and the USS Saratoga and USS Colorado were undergoing repairs in the United States.)  In spite of the latest intelligence reports about the missing aircraft carriers (his most important targets), Admiral Nagumo decided to continue the attack with his force of six carriers and 423 aircraft. At a range of 230 miles north of Oahu, he launched the first wave of a two-wave attack. Beginning at 0600 hours his first wave consisted of 183 fighters and torpedo bombers which struck at the fleet in Pearl Harbor and the airfields in Hickam, Kaneohe and Ewa. The second strike, launched at 0715 hours, consisted of 167 aircraft, which again struck at the same targets.  At 0753 hours the first wave consisting of 40 Nakajima B5N2 \"Kate\" torpedo bombers, 51 Aichi D3A1 \"Val\" dive bombers, 50 high altitude bombers and 43 Zeros struck airfields and Pearl Harbor Within the next hour, the second wave arrived and continued the attack.\nWhen it was over, the U.S. losses were:  Casualties\nUSA : 218 KIA, 364 WIA..\nUSN: 2,008 KIA, 710 WIA.\nUSMC: 109 KIA, 69 WIA.\nCivilians: 68 KIA, 35 WIA.\nTOTAL: 2,403 KIA, 1,178 WIA.\n-------------------------------------------------   Battleships\nUSS Arizona (BB-39) - total loss whe n a bomb hit her magazine.\nUSS Oklahoma (BB-37) - Total loss when she capsized and sunk in the harbor.\nUSS California (BB-44) - Sunk at her berth.

The legislation also boosted funding for unemployment benefits, set aside billions of dollars for loans to help small businesses, and increased health care spending by $100 billion, among other provisions. $1,200 checks But the bill included an additional benefit for wealthy Americans, per national media headlines in mid-April: Over 43,000 U.S. Millionaires will get stimulus averaging $1.6 million each\" (New York Post) and \"How Some Rich Americans Are Getting Checks Averaging $1.7 million\" (Forbes). Snopes received numerous reader inquiries about the veracity of those reports.  Over 43,000 U.S. Millionaires will get stimulus averaging $1.6 million each How Some Rich Americans Are Getting Checks Averaging $1.7 million\" The claim is multi-pronged: that millionaires and other Americans received the same type of stimulus checks, termed \"Economic Impact Payments\"; that those payments were higher for millionaires than for other workers; and that the economic benefits for the country's wealthiest residents averaged $1.7 million each under the CARES Act. other Americans The coronavirus relief package authorized the federal government to send: For single tax filers with higher annual salaries  but less than $99,000  the federal government is reducing the stimulus checks by $5 for each $100 above the $75,000 threshold (similar math goes for payments to families). Yet here is evidence that proves part of the above claim false, in the words of the IRS: \"Tax filers with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 for individuals and up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns will receive the full payment\"  which does not exceed the amounts of $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for joint claims, and $500 per qualifying child. That means only in this hypothetical situation  a family had 3,400 qualifying children  could an American receive a stimulus check of $1.7 million. Here's language verbatim from the CARES Act:   However, the latter part of the claim  that millionaires could reap an average of $1.7 million in financial gains under the CARES Act  is less definite. The answer begins with understanding pre-CARES Act tax code. In 2017, the federal government established new limitations on how much money owners of so-called \"pass-through\" businesses can deduct as losses against their \"nonbusiness\" income to minimize their tax liability. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, owners of such businesses  entities where profits flow through to owners and are not subject to corporate income taxes  could deduct a maximum of $250,000 in losses individually ($500,000 for couples) to offset taxable income from other sources, such as capital gains. Two Democratic Congressmen  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Rep. Llloyd Doggett of Texas  have explained the rule like this: pass-through\" Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, have explained If one spouse owns a company that had a $5 million loss in 2018 and the other spouse made $5 million from stock market investments, this limitation meant that the couples taxable income was $4.5 million (not zero, if the loss were allowed to fully cancel out the income). The other $4.5 million in losses, however, could be carried forward to use in future years. Provisions in the CARES Act temporarily suspended that limitation until the start of 2021, according to an analysis of legislative records by Snopes. In other words, the IRS is legally obligated to count excess losses from businesses that it otherwise wouldnt have and provide them with \"the same treatment as if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had not been enacted,\" according to attorneys with the international law firm Foley and Lardner.  Foley and Lardner Additionally, the provisions change the timeline of the 2017 law and allow for the new standard to retroactively apply, enabling businesses to report losses in 2018 and 2019 against the past five years. Those taxpayers, however, would likely need to amend their 2018 and 2019 tax returns if they have already been filed to see any changes, according to the tax consulting firm Calvetti Ferguson.  Calvetti Ferguson And since the modification under the CARES Act only applies until Dec. 31, 2020, the 2017 law will kick in the following year. Here's how that change to tax code is relevant to the claim: Americans who earn $1 million or more will benefit the most from the temporary suspension on the deduction limit, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan congressional body the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). In early April 2020, Whitehouse and Doggett requested the committee to research \"the distributional effects\" of the provision within the CARES Act. Later, the commissions chief of staff, Thomas Barthold, shared its findings in a letter to the congressmen, including the caveat: Joint Committee on Taxation in a letter There is, of course, a great deal of uncertainty about the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how those economic effects will translate into business losses for individuals. The revenue estimate represents our best effort to give Congress useful information about the potential scale of revenue changes associated with this provision. The letter included the following table, showing what class of Americans will receive what percentage of benefits from the amendment to the 2017 tax law:   The table shows almost 82% of the provision's benefits will go toward about 43,000 Americans who earn $1 million or more annually. Put another way, hedge-fund investors and owners of real estate businesses are \"far and away\" the two prime beneficiaries of the change to the 2017 tax law, Steve Rosenthal, a tax expert at the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told The Washington Post. The JCT also found that suspending the limitation for \"pass-through\" businesses will cost taxpayers about $90 billion in 2020 alone, the Post reported. Tax Policy Center The Washington Post Using those numbers, you can do back-of-the-napkin math to estimate the amount of money the country's wealthiest population could reduce from their tax burden as a result of the change (82% of $90 billion): about $73.8 billion. Then, if you divide that total by the estimated number of impacted Americans who earn $1 million or more (43,000), you end up with an average of $1,716,279  or about $1.7 million  each. \"If you take the reports calculations at face value, that means that, on average, each of the eligible taxpayers would get a windfall of ~$1.7 million! Forbes contributor Shahar Ziv wrote. Clearly not all of those earning only $1 million will receive a $1.7 million tax cut; however, just as some may receive less than the $1.7 million, some may benefit much more.\" In sum, given that U.S. millionaires won't receive stimulus payments based on their income under the CARES Act but rather the Act's provisions enable those Americans to take advantage of a temporary tax relief  potentially to the tune of $1.7 million on average  we rate this claim as a \"Mixture\" of true and false information.

        ],
        "justification": "On June 13, 2023, one day after the Denver Nuggets had won their first NBA title, we looked into a claim that was made in an online article that said former NBA star Charles Barkley was leaving the TNT TV show, \"Inside the NBA.\" won According to the story, Barkley had either resigned or his contract with TNT was \"abruptly terminated.\" The headline of the article read, \"TNT Has Pointed The Finger At Charles's Wife, Maureen Blumhardt, For The Analyst's Unexpected Resignation.\" However, this rumor was false. The made-up story was published on an unknown date prior to June 13 in order to push a scam involving the promotion of purported keto weight loss gummies. The article showed a logo for an apparently made-up news organization named, \"Breaking News Alerts (BNA).\" It wasposted to the dubious website top-magazine-trending.com and began as follows: She's famously known as Charles Barkley's wife, but Maureen Blumhardt has proven she's a savvy businesswoman in her own right - and Charles Barkley is in DEEP trouble for it. Maureen Blumhardt, most famously known as the 59-year-old wife of Charles Barkley, has shocked the entire world after being revealed as the sole reason for her husband's departure from his hit TV show 'Inside The NBA'. Why? Because she failed to disclose her massive weight loss company to TNT (while making regular appearances on the show), which is actually a HUGE competitor to the show's sponsor 'Weight Watchers'. Maureen's product is one tenth of the price and twice as effective as their competing product, which has Weight Watchers threatening to pull advertising from the network completely. Charles Barkley's contract was abruptly terminated. Lucky for them, Maureen's product has been incredibly successful and is taking over the weight loss world by storm - and her net worth is even more than his! The product is called Quickshot Keto Gummies and it has taken the world by storm. Quickshot Keto Gummies is repeatedly selling out within minutes and Maureen says her number one struggle as CEO is sourcing enough products to be able to adequately service the demand. We were unable to obtain a working link to the article to include in our fact check. The reason for this was that scammers employ tactics to make their articles hidden unless they've been accessed via specific ads. When users click on those specific ads, the ads act like a key to open a door, unlocking the article to display on their screens. The top of the article falsely claimed that the news had been shared by CBS News, ABC, NBC, and Fox. The scam also misleadingly said that celebrities including Jennifer Aniston, Ellen DeGeneres, Kim Kardashian, Charlize Theron, and Sandra Bullock all joined with Barkley and his wife, Maureen Blumhardt, to endorse keto weight loss gummies, even though they had nothing to do with the products. The image and likeness of each of these famous people were used without permission. Barkley The article played on the oldmeme of unnamed doctors being mad about something. Remember old ads with the line, \"Doctors Hate Him\"? The story said that Blumhardt had made doctors \"angry\" and \"furious\" by revealing something about keto weight loss gummies. Again, this was completely made up. meme CBD and keto gummies scams often claim that people will be able to magically lose weight with the products, and that no diet or exercise would be required. In the past, many of the websites where the supposed weight loss gummies could be purchased enrolled customers in subscription charges of hundreds of dollars per month.

            "Did Dr. Robert Atkins, proponent of the low-carbohydrate diet, die of a heart attack?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:   Dr. Robert Atkins, proponent of the low-carbohydrate diet, died of a heart attack. Status:  Undetermined. Examples:  [Collected via e-mail, 2004] \n\n\nI've been seeing a lot of stuff about the death of Dr Atkins who developed the Atkins low carb diet.  A lot of it is about his autopsy report supposedly showing that the fall that killed him was actually\ncaused by a heart attack.  Some of the messages and email even say that the person who did the autopsy released it on CNN.\n \n i'm not an atkins dieter (obviously), and i recently heard a rumor(?) saying that the inventor of the Atkins diet (Charles Atkins, maybe?) died at the age of 49 of a heart attack (the heart attack resulting from a life of unhealthy eating).\n \n Any truth to the rumor that Robert Atkins had a heart attack that caused him to slip and fall on the ice?\n Origins:  Our sense of the quirky appears to thirst for the irony of life, those strange outcomes that run contrary to what we conclude should happen. It is thus pleasing to envision the doctor who led so many to a permissive diet regimen as having been felled by the very health advice he touted to millions (and which made him millions in return). Famed nutritionist and author Dr. Robert Atkins died on 17 April 2003 at the age of 72 after sustaining head injuries in a fall outside his New York clinic. But did more underlie his demise than merely a slippery walkway? Robert Atkins has been termed \"the apostle of protein gluttony as a passport to health, wholesomeness and the perfect figure.\" He came to  public notice in 1972 with his claims for a revolutionary diet that guaranteed weight loss. What became known as the \"Atkins Diet\" was first published in his book Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution and swiftly became popular with those looking to shed pounds. Whereas advocates of other diets entreat the weight-enhanced to eschew fats even as they feast on rice and yogurt, those on the Atkins diet are enjoined to carry on with their eating of steaks, roasts, fried eggs and bacon, but to control their intake of carbohydrates.  The hungry flocked to the Atkins Diet standard as soon as it was raised. It is estimated Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution has been read by more than 30 million people, many of them now intent on chewing their way to weight loss through flouting the conventional diet wisdom of \"fat = bad.\" As popular as the diet has proved to be with the masses, critics claim it raises the risk of heart disease and kidney stones. It is for this reason speculation about the cause of Dr. Atkins' death is such a hot topic. It is known Robert Atkins did indeed weather a heart attack during his lifetime. In April 2002, the diet guru issued a statement saying he was recovering from cardiac arrest related to a heart infection he had suffered from \"for a few years.\" He said it was \"in no way related to diet.\"  However, revelations in February 2004 from the city medical examiner's report let slip the information that Atkins had suffered a heart attack, congestive heart failure, and hypertension, before his death. The report was given to the Journal by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a group that advocates vegetarianism. Because the medical examiner's office is claiming this information was circulated in error, it may not be possible at this time to determine if what was in that report referred to events that immediately preceded (and therefore might have caused) the doctor's death, or if they were in reference to damage done over the course of a lifetime.  (The report had been sent to a doctor in Nebraska who requested it. It was later discovered the person it was sent to was not \"the treating physician\" and so should not have had access to the report.) At present, the medical examiner's office will only say Atkins died of a head injury from the fall. \"I can't comment on people's previous conditions. It's against the law,\" said spokeswoman Ellen Borakove.  It needs be kept in mind that even if the medical examiner's office does become more forthcoming, it still may not be able to answer the question of whether a heart attack brought about the demise of Dr. Atkins. An autopsy was not performed on him because of family objections to the procedure. Consequently, the medical examiner conducted only an external exam and a review of Atkins' hospital records.  The state of Robert Atkins' health is open to debate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's body-mass index calculator, at 258 pounds, the 6-foot-tall Atkins would have qualified as obese. (The CDC's calculator offers a classification system of four benchmarks: underweight, normal, overweight, and obese, so an \"obese\" determination should be viewed as extending far beyond the carrying of a little additional poundage.) While it is true the data of the extremely well muscled (e.g., Arnold Schwarzenegger) would likewise show them to be obese, more physically typical people will find these determinations relevant to themselves. body-mass However, Atkins' widow and Dr. Stuart Trager, the spokesperson for Atkins Physicians Council, both contend Robert Atkins weighed less than 200 pounds at the time of his accident, claiming \"During his coma, as he deteriorated and his major organs failed, fluid retention and bloating dramatically distorted his body and left him at 258 pounds at the time of his death, a documented weight gain of over 60 pounds.\" Thanks to his death certificate, we know Atkins was 258 pounds at the time of his death.  Yet according to a copy of his medical records, as turned over to USA Today by the diet guru's widow, Atkins weighed 195 pounds upon admission to the hospital 8 April 2003 following his fall. He died on 17 April 2003 after having been in a coma for more than a week. death certificate Barbara \"weighty matters\" Mikkelson Last updated:  11 February 2004\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   Hellmich, Nanci and Steve Sternberg.  \"Atkins Wasn't Obese, Hospital File Shows.\"\n   USA Today.  11 February 2004.

        "justification": "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepared to take office in December 2016, multiple news reports addressed the potential conflicts of interest he would face as he transitioned from a businessman to chief executive. Many critics urged Trump to divest himself of his businesses and cited former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's sale of his peanut farm as an exemplary model of how to head off such potential conflicts: conflicts of interest         In May 2020, after an appeals court ruled that a lawsuit could proceed alleging that Trump had violated the constitution by receiving foreign money through his hotels, comparisons between Carter and Trump once again gained traction on social media: court ruled that a lawsuit social media   While Carter did place his businesses into a blind trust before he was elected president in 1977, he didn't actually sell his peanut farm until he left office in 1981.  On Jan. 5, 1977, Carter released a plan detailing how his assets would be handled when he assumed office. Carter listed eight actions that he would take to avoid conflicts of interest, including transferring Carter's Warehouse, Carter Farms, and all funds related to those business ventures into a trust: released listed The transition group has studied existing laws and regulations bearing on conflicts of interest and the regulation of ethics of officials in the executive branch of government. The existing law is extremely strong in prohibiting outside earned income. Governor Carter heavily approves of that law and its policy ... In order to prevent possible financial conflicts of interest while President, Governor Jimmy Carter is taking the following actions: 1. All common stock is being sold, consisting of 100 shares of Rich's, Inc. and 956 shares of Advanced Investors. A small net loss on this stock is likely. 2. Jimmy Carter's interest in (a) Carter's Warehouse and Carter Farms, Inc., and any funds related to them (b) all property except the private home and personal items, and (c) his father's estate will be transferred to a trust. Income or principal from the trust will be available to Jimmy Carter but only as distributions of cash. Carter's business suffered significantly while he served as president, but it wasn't until he left office in 1981 that the decision was made to sell the family farm: suffered While he serves as president, Jimmy Carter placed the family farm supply business into the protection of a blind trust before he left for Washington, D.C. in 1977. This trust allowed for a law firm in Atlanta to take full administration of the farm supply business during his years in the White House. The Carters felt that relinquishing the business to someone elses care would separate them from these affairs and avoid the possibility of their financial holdings resembling any conflict of interest while President Carter was in office. Their personal counsel, Charles Kirbo of the Atlanta law firm, was their financial trustee. Following the election loss in 1981, the Carters were informed by Charles Kirbo that because of three years of drought and several changes in warehouse management, they were over $1 million in debt. As they struggled to recover from the unexpected financial blow, the solution to their problem became evident. The Carters sold the family business and also began writing books, which helped them recover financially. In regards to a meme's claim that Carter was still building houses at the age of 92, that is, for the most part, true. Carter has been building houses with Habitat for Humanity since 1984. At the age of 92, he was still actively participating in the construction of new homes. The above-displayed meme is a few years old, however, as Carter is 95 years old at the time of this writing in May 2020.  If the text of this meme was altered to give Carter's current age, it would still be true. In October 2019, shortly after suffering a fall at his home that required stitches, Carter was back on the construction site. A Habitat for Humanitys Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project has also been announced in the Dominican Republic for November 2020, but it's unclear if Carter will travel to the country to take part in the construction: back on the construction site announced Since beginning their work with Habitat for Humanity in 1984, President and Mrs. Carter have helped to build, renovate and repair 4,390 homes in 14 countries alongside more than 104,000 volunteers through their annual work project. Since its founding in 1976, Habitat has served more than 22 million people around the world. We are honored to host the 2020 Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project in the Dominican Republic, said Cesarina Fabin, national director of Habitat for Humanity Dominican Republic. President and Mrs. Carter are shining examples of service. We are so grateful to their commitment to building a world where everyone has a safe and decent place to live. In summary, Carter placed his peanut farm into a blind trust when he took office in 1977. It wasn't until he left office four years later that the farm was sold.

        "justification": " Claim:  A hearing-impaired student at Tioga Hills Elementary School was physically disciplined by a teacher and sustained a dislocated shoulder as a result. UNDETERMINED Example:  [Collected via Facebook, April 2015] \n\n\n  \n\nPLEASE SHARE! I would like to ask my friends to please share and support us at this time. I am not going to stand silent anymore. On Tuesday, March 17th, my son, Tommy suffered an attack on him by his math teacher, Mrs. Joan Barr Pokorak at Tioga Hills Elementary School in the Vestal School District. As many of you know, my 10 year old, fourth grade son, Tommy has been through many ear surgeries over the past years, resulting in a significant hearing loss in his left ear. He has a 504 Plan in place at school due to his disability. The plan specifies that he have preferential seating in the front of the room with his right ear, his \"good\" ear towards the teacher. This plan has been in place over 2 years. It came to our attention that during this math teacher's class, Tommy is seated near the back of the classroom with his impaired ear in the direction of the math teacher. During CSE meetings the hearing specialist from the school noted that Tom cannot hear in this position. Tommy and students in the classroom testify that on Tuesday, March 17th Mrs. Pokorak was working on a math problem at the front of the room and hesitating with an answer. Tommy blurted out, \"the answer is..\" giving the answer out of turn. From what students have testified, Mrs. Pokorak screamed, \"GET OUT!!!!\"   Tommy said he was startled and wasn't sure if she was talking to him. She came directly behind him, dragged and lifted him up from his chair, pulled him by his right arm to the door and pushed him out into the hallway with both hands while screaming, \"GET OUT!!!\" She then slammed the door, causing the teacher from the next door classroom to come out into the hallway to see what was going on. Parents reported to me, that students still in the classroom sat there stunned. My son was hurting, shocked, and terrified what just happened to him. When Tommy came home that day, I checked with parents of students in the class to see what they would say happened. They all told the same scenario that Tom relayed of the events. Tommy complained of shoulder pain and his shoulder was making very loud popping sounds. Concerned that the teacher had injured his shoulder, I took him to Lourdes Hospital Emergency Room. X-rays and the Dr. confirmed that due to the attack on Tommy from this teacher, he suffered a third degree separation (Closed dislocation) of his Acromioclavicular Joint with significant scapular winging. At that time the hospital social worker said as a mandated reporter she must call Child Protective Services for an investigation of the case. Our family was devastated. Expecting to hear from Vestal School District regarding their concern for Tom's health and well being we waited and waited thinking we would be contacted by someone from the district. Up to this point, no explanation or even acknowledgement of the incident has been made on the part of the school. The State Police investigator has informed us that the school district has blocked him from contacting individuals, students, and has retained legal counsel for Mrs. Pokarak.  Again, to this day she refuses to speak to the investigator regarding her brutal attack on my son. Now, the Tioga County District Attorney, Eric Gartenman, is refusing to speak with our attorney regarding this incident. We are left confused and without resolution or answers as to why. When speaking with the investigating officer, he stated that Mr. Gartenman felt that Mrs. Pokarak was justified in injuring my son due to his \"talking in class.\" The investigator stated that Tommy wasn't out of control, disrespectful to the teacher or others..he was \"talking.\" When we explained that he MUST be seated toward the front of the room with his good ear facing the teacher (according to his 504 plan) Tommy said he truly didn't hear the teacher from where he was placed in the classroom if she had asked him to be quiet. Why couldn't she ask him to leave the class, why the brutal attack that resulted in a dislocation? What kind of force and anger causes this action and injury? Why is this okay? And WHY are there so many questions left unanswered?!  My son is now experiencing both physical and emotional trauma due to this assault. He is afraid to be in school, afraid of another attack. If not on my son..who will be next? Our elected officials are doing NOTHING!! So, when you think your kids are safe at school, think again. It is with a heavy heart that I post this and ask for support, because I am a teacher and can't even imagine EVER harming one of my students. Please, please help us get the word out regarding this cover up by Vestal School District and Eric Gartenman and ask for justice on behalf of my son. Keep all of our children safe. Please \"Share\" in hopes we migh get some help and resolution and prevent this from happening to someone else's child. Thank you so much- Sharon and Frank Russo.

According to Ms. Russo's account, her fourth-grade son has a significant hearing loss in one ear and is therefore typically seated in classrooms towards the front of the room with his \"good\" ear positioned towards the teacher in order to help compensate for his hearing loss. For some reason Tommy was seated in a disadvantageous position in his math class, and when he supposedly blurted out something like \"c'mon, the answer is ...\" in reference to a math problem the teacher was attempting to work out on in front of the room, the teacher yelled at him to \"GET OUT\" of the classroom. When Tommy failed to respond to this command (because his hearing issue made him unsure whether it was addressed to him), the teacher physically dragged him out of his seat, pushed and pulled him out the classroom door and into the hallway, and slammed the door behind him, screaming at him and dislocating his shoulder in the process. posted The New York State Police Child Abuse hotline was contacted a day after the alleged incident, and in April 2015 state police reported they had completed an investigation into the allegations and that a decision on whether to pursue criminal charges (two possible misdemeanor charges) rested in the hands of the Tioga County District Attorney. On 6 April 2015 Ms. Russo posted again about the incident to her Facebook page, indicating that the district attorney's office had opened a case about the matter: posted \n\nI spoke with my attorney, Mr. Ronald Benjamin. He told me that he has been in contact with Mr. Gartenman (1st Assistant DA for Tioga Co.) and the case has been opened. He expressed that as soon as the big trial Tioga Co. is dealing with now is over, they will be dealing with the CPS investigation from the NY State Police regarding Mrs. P.\nMr. Benjamin also said he would speak to media regarding the case and they should contact him should they wish.  As for the teacher, Mrs. P- She is still at Tioga Hills Elementary as of today.\n\n However, on 7 April 2015 Vestal Central School District Superintendent Mark LaRoach sent a letter to parents of students at Tioga Hills Elementary stating that the District Attorney's office had determined the accusations were unfounded and the teacher had been exonerated. letter Nonetheless, the Russos' attorney said they had filed an action against the school district that would \"mature into a lawsuit in the next couple of months.\" Last updated:  9 April 2015\n ",

Claim: Using a Minion-themed, banana-scented bubble bath caused a girl to lose her eyebrows.  UNDETERMINED Origins: On 6 August 2015, Facebook user Melissa Jolly Graves posted a status update reporting that her daughter had suffered the loss of her eyebrows after using a Minion-themed form of banana-scented bubble bath: status update  Please watch and share. My daughter was in the bath tonight using Minion banana flavored bubble bath. She was having fun making faces with the bubbles on her face. As a mom (and once a kid) I laughed and thought it was cute. That was until the bubbles came off, and with them, her eyebrows. I don't know how I can fix this. The hair came out at the roots, it looks like she had them waxed. I placed some on a patch on my arm, and the hair came off on that too. Parents, please learn from my mistake and don't allow your children to play with these.  The product in question is distributed by MZB Accessories, which offers a variety of (identically formulated) bubble bath products themed with popular children's characters: MZB Accessories MZB's bubble bath products list no non-standard ingredients on their labels, and we've found no reports of this brand of bubble bath (or any other) causing a loss of eyebrows.  Without much more additional information, it's not possible to definitively determine whether the product in question was wholly or partly responsible for the reported symptom.  Possibilities include product contamination (either pre- or post-purchase), an allergic reaction specific to this particular child (perhaps unlikely given that the mother reported the product also caused her to lose some of her own arm hair), an unusual combination of factors (of which the bubble bath was just one element), or that the symptom was completely coincidental to the use of the bath product. ingredients Last updated: 9 August 2015 Originally published:  9 August 2015",

U.S. Electoral College Joe Biden tweet Donald Trump  The claim was accurate, and we unpack why below. It followed weeks of both leaders' remaining quiet on the election's outcome amid court battles and an aggressive misinformation campaign by Trump to try to overturn his loss. misinformation campaign Let us lay out the timeline. At 10:20 a.m. Moscow standard time, which is 2:20 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) in the U.S., on Dec. 15, the Kremlin released a statement in which Putin congratulated Biden on winning the presidential race and wished him \"every success.\" The statement read: released a statement In his message, Vladimir Putin wished the President-elect every success and expressed confidence that Russia and the United States, which bear special responsibility for global security and stability, can, despite their differences, effectively contribute to solving many problems and meeting challenges that the world is facing today. The President of Russia noted that with this in mind, Russian-American cooperation, based on the principles of equality and mutual respect, would meet the interests of both nations and the entire international community. 'For my part, I am ready for interaction and contacts with you,' Russias Head of State stressed. Hours later, McConnell, a Republican, acknowledged the victory for Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris for the first time in a prepared speech on the Senate floor. Kamala Harris According to a video of the remarks on the Majority Leader's YouTube channel  footage that was uploaded to the video platform around 11 a.m. EST and also appeared on his official website as a Kentucky senator  McConnell said: official website as a Kentucky senator The Electoral College has spoken. So today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden. The President-elect is no stranger to the Senate. He has devoted himself to public service for many years. I also congratulate the Vice President-elect, our colleague from California, Senator Harris. Beyond our differences, all Americans can take pride that our nation has a female Vice President-elect for the first time. News outlets, including MSNBC, first reported on McConnell's remarks around 10:20 a.m. (ET). A tweet from McConnell's press team with a link to the YouTube video posted less than 30 minutes later, at 10:47 a.m. tweet   Some onlookers on social media speculated McConnell purposefully waited for Putin's statement on the election before making his own. \"It has always been Putin pulling their strings, not Trump,\" one Twitter user alleged, referring to Republican leadership. Twitter user But there was no evidence to explicitly explain why or under what rationale the senator made his comments on the Senate floor, congratulating Biden more than a month after he was announced the next head of the White House. Also unknown was if or to what extent he at all considered Putin's statement hours prior signifying a new chapter in U.S.-Russia relations.  All of that said, the Kentucky Republican recognized a Biden presidency roughly eight hours after the Russian leader. For that reason, we rate this claim \"True.\"",

        "justification": "Claim:  A Flight 175 passenger who insisted upon retrieving his forgotten tefillin delayed the doomed flight.  \nStatus:  Status:  False.\n Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2006] \n\n\nDavid Miller* [*not his real name], a pious observant Jew was at Logan Airport getting ready to board United Flight 175. He was going to LA on an important business trip and had to make this flight. A lot depended on it. He boarded the plane, watched the doors close, and sat down. Suddenly he remembered that he left his tefillin (ritual boxes with straps worn by Jewish men in prayer) in the terminal boarding area. He politely asked the stewardess if he could go back and retrieve his tefillin, which were sitting just a few feet from the gate. She told him that once the doors of the plane closed, no one was allowed off the plane. Not about to take this sitting down, he asked if he could speak to the pilot to obtain special permission. Surely the pilot would understand. The pilot did not comply. He simply restated the policy. David was not about to lose this precious mitzvah, or let the holy tefillin get lost like that, so, not knowing what else to do, he started screaming at the top of his lungs, \"I am going to lose my tefillin.\" The crew asked him to be quiet, but he refused to stop making a fuss  a rather loud fuss.  Finally, he was making such a ruckus and a tumult that the flight crew told him that they would let him off the plane, simply because he was a nuisance. In fact, even though it would only take about 90 seconds to run out, grab his tefillin, and run back - they were not going to wait for him. No matter. David was not about to lose his tefillin, even if it caused him great inconvenience or cost his business a loss. He left the plane, never to reboard. This flight was United #175. The second plane to reach the WTC. David's devotion to a mitzvah saved his life. The consequences of David's actions do not end there. Originally the terrorists wanted both towers struck simultaneously to maximize the explosive carnage. Later it was learned that due to this whole tumult, the takeoff was delayed, causing a space of 18 minutes between the striking of the two towers. This delay made it possible for thousands more people to escape alive from both buildings. Literally thousands, if not tens of thousands, of lives were spared because one Jew would not forsake his beloved tefillin.\n Origins:  This story first reached the snopes.com inbox in June 2006. While it would be somewhat heartening to believe one of those otherwise fated to die on September 11 escaped being murdered by the terrorists who used commercial aircraft as weapons through his stubborn refusal to compromise his piety by leaving his tefillin behind, this tale does not seem to pass scrutiny.  tefillin At 8:14 a.m. on 11 September 2001, United Airlines Flight 175 left Boston's Logan Airport for Los Angeles with 65 people aboard. Terrorists who were on that flight hijacked the plane and crashed it into the south tower of World Trade Center at 9:06 a.m., 18 minutes after American Airlines Flight 11 (with 92 people aboard) was flown into the north tower of World Trade Center at 8:48 a.m. None of the news accounts or official investigations we've examined of the events of that day mention anyone's insisting to be let off Flight 175 at the last moment (to retrieve religious items or for any other purpose) or suddenly exiting the plane after the doors had been closed. Also, accommodating a passenger who had changed his mind about flying would not merely have been a matter of letting that person off the plane  even before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, an exiting passenger's checked luggage would have had to have been retrieved from the airplane's cargo  hold. Moreover, even if a passenger on that plane had created a last-minute fuss, such an event doesn't appear to be connectible to the flight's delay in taking off. While Flight 175 was 16 minutes late getting airborne, finally taking off at 8:14 AM, it did push back from Gate 19 at Logan within a minute of its regularly scheduled departure time and therefore did not spend that 16-minute interval sitting at the gate.  The intervening period before the plane's eventual take-off was expended on the tarmac, presumably a result of routine tie-up in morning taxiing times. Once the flight had pushed back from the gate and entered traffic on the runways at Logan, it could not have disgorged a passenger, no matter how insistent he might have been, without returning to the gate. And United Flight 175 did not return to the gate  it took to the air just as American Flight 11 was being hijacked. The account of a pious Jew who disembarked from Flight 175 because he would not be parted from his sacred objects and by so doing delayed the second plane's hitting the World Trade Center for 18 minutes, thereby giving countless others a chance to flee the south tower, is found in Even in the Darkest Moments, a 2002 collection of September 11 stories compiled by Zeev Breier. It appears in that anthology as \"Beloved Mitzvah\" by Rabbi Israel Feinhandler, a writer of many instructional books on marriage and child rearing who is described by The Weekly Parsha as a \"Rabbi of a community in the Romema section of Jerusalem, a renowned posek, and a lecturer in various yeshivos and kollelim in Jerusalem.\" While the story appears to be more fable than truth, it perhaps more fairly should be regarded as an object lesson on the importance of maintaining one's religious convictions even when it would be far more convenient to set them aside.

The latest craze among the environmentally conscious crowd of twentysomethings, the \"Suiso\" beer made by the Asaka Beer Corporation has been extremely popular at karaoke sing-along bars and discotheques.  Hydrogen, like helium, is a gas lighter than air. Because hydrogen molecules are lighter than air, sound waves are transmitted more rapidly; individuals whose lungs are filled with the nontoxic gas can speak with an uncharacteristically high voice.  Exploiting this quirk of physics, chic urbanites can now sing soprano parts on karaoke sing-along machines after consuming a big gulp of Suiso beer.  The drink comes in a transparent hexagonal bottle imported from the maker of the new American drink, Zima,\" according to Hideki Saito, marketing director of Asaka Beer Corp. While the bottles are imported from Tennessee, the labels are made with a 100% biodegradable polymer. The bottle caps are equipped with a safety valve to prevent excess build-up of pressure in high temperatures.  The flammable nature of hydrogen has also become another selling point, even though Asaka has not acknowledged that this was a deliberate marketing ploy. It has inspired a new fashion of blowing flames from one's mouth using a cigarette as an ignition source. Many new karaoke videos feature singers shooting blue flames in slow motion, while flame contests took place in pubs everywhere in Tokyo on New Year's eve.  So far, Asaka beer has insisted that the quantities of hydrogen used in the drinks is too low to create potential for bodily harm. In the factory, the carbon dioxide that is dissolved in the beer is partially extracted and replaced with hydrogen gas. Mr. Saito maintained that the remaining carbon dioxide mixed with hydrogen prevents the rate of combustion from increasing dramatically. Carbon dioxide is a nonflammable gas that is naturally contained in the exhaled breath of humans.  However, the company has hesitated from marketing the product in the US due to legal complications.  Each bottle of Suiso beer sells for approximately 1,200 yen, or 11 US dollars. The bottles are packed in special crates lined with concrete to prevent chain explosions in the event of a fire.\n Origins:  Initially making the rounds in 1994, this bit of fiction is still in circulation on the Internet and continues to pop up in the media. Additional spurious details   about an injured participant engaging in a lawsuit against the brew's manufacturer and a karaoke bar were\nadded to the story in late 1998.  Folks will believe most anything, provided someone sticks \"AP\" at the front of it. Though it was decked out to look like it, the above wasn't a real wire service story. (Even so, this tale has suckered a fine selection of highly-respected newspapers, including The New York Times in March 1996, the Boston Globe in November 1997, and The Washington Post in September 1999. It has also appeared in a widely-used introductory-level college chemistry textbook.) There is no Asaka Beer Corporation. Due to tight government regulations, there are only five beer companies in Japan: Kirin (40.6% market share), Asahi (37.6%), Sapporo (15.8%), Suntory (5%) and Orion (1%). Nor is there a Suiso beer. Both these names are made up, nothing more than wonderful bits of embroidery employed to give a fanciful tale an aura of believability. Proving yet again that no story is too good not to be improved upon, the following version appeared in inboxes everywhere in late 1998: \n\nTOKYO (AP) The recent craze for hydrogen beer is at the heart of a three way lawsuit between unemployed stockbroker Toshira Otoma, the Tike-Take karaoke bar and the Asaka Beer Corporation. Mr Otoma is suing the bar and the brewery for selling toxic substances and is claiming damages for grievous bodily harm leading to the loss of his job. The bar is countersuing for defamation and loss of customers. The Asaka Beer corporation brews \"Suiso\" brand beer, where the carbon dioxide normally used to add fizz has been replaced by the more environmentally friendly hydrogen gas. A side effect of this has made the beer extremely popular at karaoke sing-along bars and discotheques.  Hydrogen, like helium, is a gas lighter than air. Because hydrogen molecules are lighter than air, sound waves are transmitted more rapidly;  individuals whose lungs are filled with the nontoxic gas can speak with an uncharacteristically high voice. Exploiting this quirk of physics, chic urbanites can now sing soprano parts on karaoke sing-along machines after consuming a big gulp of Suiso beer. The flammable nature of hydrogen has also become another selling point, even though Asaka has not acknowledged that this was a deliberate marketing ploy. It has inspired a new fashion of blowing flames from one's mouth using a cigarette as an ignition source. Many new karaoke videos feature singers shooting blue flames in slow motion, while flame contests take place in pubs everywhere. \"Mr Otoma has no-one to blame but himself.  If he had not become drunk and disorderly, none of this would have happened.  Our security guards undergo the most careful screening and training before they are allowed to deal with customers\" said Mr Takashi Nomura, Manager of the Tike-Take bar. \"Mr Otoma drank fifteen bottles of hydrogen beer in order to maximise the size of the flames he could belch during the contest. He catapulted balls of fire across the room that Gojira would be proud of, but this was not enough to win him first prize since the judgement is made on the quality of the flames and that of the singing, and after fifteen bottles of lager he was badly out of tune.\" \"He took exception to the result and hurled blue fireballs at the judge, singeing the front of Mrs Mifune's hair, entirely removing her eyebrows and lashes, and ruining the clothes of two nearby customers. None of these people have returned to my bar. When our security staff approached he turned his attentions to them, making it almost impossible to approach him. Our head bouncer had no choice but to hurl himself at Mr Otoma's knees, knocking his legs from under him.\" \"The laws of physics are not to be disobeyed, and the force that propelled Mr Otoma's legs backwards also pivoted around his centre of gravity and moved his upper body forward with equal velocity. It was his own fault he had his mouth open for the next belch, his own fault he held a lighted cigarette in front of it and it is own fault he swallowed that cigarette.\" \"The Tike-Take bar takes no responsibility for the subsequent internal combustion, rupture of his stomach lining, nor the third degree burns to his oesophagus, larynx and sinuses as the exploding gases forced their way out of his body. His consequential muteness and loss of employment are his own fault.\" Mr Otoma was unavailable for comment.\n \nAs well he might be, since he doesn't exist. There's still no Suiso beer, no Asaka Beer Corporation, and certainly no such lawsuit. The names used in the piece give an additional clue to its being a leg-pull: Takashi Nomura and Toshiro Mifune are both actors in classic Japanese films, and Otoma comes from Katsuhiro Otomo, a modern director. This newest version makes more of a story out of the tale, turning what purported to be a staid news article about a karaoke innovation into a bemusing report about yet another silly lawsuit. Merely the mental picture of a drunken Japanese hurling blue fireballs at the judges who'd passed him over is enough to keep one entertained for hours. Karaoke is weird enough without anyone having to blow blue flames as part of it.

        "justification": "Shortly after the death of Prince Rogers Nelson (the musician known solely as Prince) in April 2016, an image macroexaggerating the musician's role in the commercial success of NBA superstar Michael Jordan began  circulating online:   album The claim about Prince's bringing Michael Jordan to Nike in 1983 is possible in a temporal sense (Jordan first signed with the company in 1984), but we found no evidence that events actually transpiredinthe manner described by this macro. Contemporaneous news articles from 1984 also failed to mention any connection between Prince, Jordan and Nike. mention An article published by ESPN in February 2013 gave a detailed history about how Michael Jordan landed with Nike, and while ESPN identified several people involved in getting Jordan to meet with Nike (Jordan wore Converse shoes rather than Nikes and was reluctant to switch), Prince was not among them: Nike was a fast-rising star. The company's revenue went from $28.7 million in 1973 to $867 million by the end of 1983. But things had started to turn on them toward the end of the year. In February 1984, the company reported its first quarterly loss ever. The Olympics in Los Angeles that summer provided a nice morale boost  most notably, Carl Lewis won four gold medals in Nikes  but there wasn't an immediate translation in sales. Converse and adidas weren't ready for Jordan, but all of a sudden, Nike needed him. If the company could only get him on the plane. The claim that Prince designed the Air Jordan 1 is also based on fantasy, as the first Air Jordan sneakers werecreated by Peter Moore: created Peter Moore has been involved with just about anything you find coolincluding video games, basketball kicks, and especially designing the sneaker that changed everything. Tinker Hatfield receives all the daps for his work with MJ, but it was Moore who created the first Jordan (and the ball and wings logo) that started a phenomenon. The statements made in the above-displayed macro appear to be an exaggeration of a comment issued by Jordan shortly after Prince's death: comment \"Like so many people I am shocked at the news that Prince has died,\" Jordan said. \"In a world of creative performers, Prince was a genius. His impact not just on music, but on culture, truly can't be measured. His songs inspired me throughout my career and remind me of so many moments from my life.\" Although Michael Jordan praised Prince as having inspired him throughout his career, the musician apparently had no direct impact on Jordan's commercial success with Nike.",

            "Some online observers critical of U.S. President Joe Biden sought to undercut a broadly positive employment update in March 2021."
        ],
        "justification": "In March 2021, new employment figures showed that the U.S. economy added 379,000 jobs in February, the first full month of Joe Biden's presidency. The news was greeted with cautious optimism, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that the gains had \"set up a stronger recovery\" for the spring of 2021, and The Washington Post reporting that the figures had \"surpassed analysts' estimates.\" Politico wrote that: Wall Street Journal Washington Post Politico U.S. employers added a robust 379,000 jobs last month, the most since October and a sign that the economy is strengthening as confirmed viral cases drop, consumers spend more and states and cities ease business restrictions.\nThe February gain marked a sharp pickup from the 166,000 jobs that were added in January and a loss of 306,000 in December. Yet it represents just a fraction of the roughly 10 million jobs that were lost to the pandemic. On social media, other observers  in particular those more broadly opposed to Biden  sought to undercut the significance of the jobs figures, claiming that a large majority of the increased employment came in one sector, namely food and beverage services. On Twitter, the libertarian economics blog Zerohedge wrote: wrote Of the 379K jobs added, 286K were waiters and bartenders.   The stockbroker and financial commentator Peter Schiff tweeted: tweeted 75% of the 379k jobs \"created\" in Feb. were waiters and bartenders returning to work. Since many restaurants and bars that closed will never reopen there's a limit to how long this can last... The right-wing British blog Guido Fawkes tweeted: tweeted \"US economic recovery sees 379,000 jobs added this week, 286,000 were waiters and bartenders. God bless America and cheers!\" Those figures were accurately stated, although \"waiters and bartenders\" was a reductive description of the occupations in question. As a result, we're issuing a rating of \"Mostly True.\" The standard measure of job growth is \"total nonfarm payroll employment, seasonally adjusted,\" a metric that is collated and published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), each month. On March 5, the BLS published figures for the preceding month, February 2021, writing that: \"Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 379,000 in February...\" In effect, this means that there were 379,000 more jobs in the United States in February than there were in January. published The BLS provides in-depth breakdowns of job gains or losses, and unemployment, including details on the demographic and sectoral contours of each month's data. According to the same set of figures, the \"leisure and hospitality\" sector gained 355,000 of the 379,000 total new jobs in February (Summary Table B).  Summary Table B Of those, 285,900 jobs were specifically in \"food services and drinking places\" (Table B-1). That's the source of the \"286K\" figure presented by Zerohedge. Those 285,900 jobs made up 75.4% of the total number of new jobs added in February, the percentage figure provided by Schiff in his tweet. Table B-1 However, the \"food services and drinking places\" subsector is made up of more than just \"waiters and bartenders.\" The following is how that subsector is defined in the official North American Industry Classification System: defined Industries in the Food Services and Drinking Places subsector prepare meals, snacks, and beverages to customer order for immediate on-premises and off-premises consumption. There is a wide range of establishments in these industries. Some provide food and drink only; while others provide various combinations of seating space, waiter/waitress services and incidental amenities, such as limited entertainment. The industries in the subsector are grouped based on the type and level of services provided. The industry groups are full-service restaurants; limited-service eating places; special food services, such as food service contractors, caterers, and mobile food services; and drinking places. The BLS figures for February 2021 don't specify the proportion of those 285,900 jobs composed of specific occupations, but it's highly unlikely they were all \"waiters and bartenders.\" In 2019, the most recent year for which figures are available, the following was the breakdown of occupations within the \"food services and drinking places subsector\": breakdown As can be seen from those figures, \"waiters and waitresses\" made up less than one-third of workers within that subsector. If the distribution of occupations was even broadly similar among the 285,900 new \"food services and drinking places\" jobs added in February, then it would appear highly unlikely that even a majority of those 285,900 new jobs were made up of \"waiters and bartenders\" alone.

            "Hillary Clinton asserted that women \"have always been the primary victims of war\" during a domestic violence conference in 1998."
        ],
        "justification": "In December 2015, an image of Hillary Clinton was circulated via social media along with a quote ostensibly uttered by her about the primary victims of war:  This quote originated with a 17 November 1998 speech that Hillary Clinton (as First Lady) delivered at a conference on domestic violence in El Salvador. One of the central themes of Clinton's speech was the effect that war had had on that country (the Salvadoran Civil War had ended a few years earlier), specifically in regards towomen and children.  Clinton referred to women as the \"primary victims of war\" not just in the literal sense of being injured or killed themselves (as civilian non-combatants), but also as being left without the support and care of their male family members and seeing their own children suffer and die: speech The experience that you have gone through is in many ways comparable to what happens with domestic violence. Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat. Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known. Women are often the refugees from conflict and sometimes, more frequently in today's warfare, victims. Women are often left with the responsibility, alone, of raising the children. Women are again the victims in crime and domestic violence as well. Throughout our hemisphere we have an epidemic of violence against women, even though there is no longer any organized warfare that puts women in the direct line of combat. But domestic violence is now recognized as being the most pervasive human rights violation in the world. Here in El Salvador, according to the statistics gathered by your government, 1 in 6 women have been sexually assaulted and the number of domestic abuse complaints at just one agency topped 10,000 last year. Between 25 and 50 percent of women throughout Latin America have reportedly been victims of domestic violence. The problem is all pervasive, but sometimes difficult to see. Every country on earth shares this dark secret. Too often, the women we see shopping at the markets, working at their jobs, caring for their children by day, go home at night and live in fear. Not fear of an invading army or a natural disaster or even a stranger in a dark alley, but fear of the very people  family members  who they are supposed to depend upon for help and comfort. This is the trust-destroying terror that attends every step of a victim of violence. For these women, their homes provide inadequate refuge, the law little protection, public opinion often less sympathy. That's why we have to say over and over again, as Elizabeth has done and as so many of you have echoed, that violence against women is not simply cultural or a custom. It is simply criminal, a crime. The devastating effects of domestic violence on women are just as dramatic as the effects of war on women. The physical injury, the mental illness, the terrible loss of confidence limits the capacities of women to fulfill their God-given potentials. While some might argue that Clinton was inaccurate in labeling women as the \"primary victims of war\" (since the majority of military members are male), a resolutionadoptedby theUnited Nation Security Council in 2000 arrived at a similar conclusion, stating that \"civilians, particularly women and children, accountfor the vast majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict.\" majority resolution The United Nation Security Council repeated this assertion in 2008 when it adopted Resolution 1325, which stated in its introduction that rape and sexual assault were considered tactics of war: stated [C]ivilians account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict; women and girls are particularly targeted by the use of sexual violence, including as a tactic of war to humiliate, dominate, instill fear in, disperse and/or forcibly relocate civilian members of a community or ethnic group; and sexual violence perpetrated in this manner may in some instances persist after the cessation of hostilities. [We] condemn in the strongest terms all sexual and other forms of violence committed against civilians in armed conflict, in particular women and children. [We] reiterate deep concern that, despite its repeated condemnation of violence against women and children in situations of armed conflict, including sexual violence in situations of armed conflict, and despite its calls addressed to all parties to armed conflict for the cessation of such acts with immediate effect, such acts continue to occur, and in some situations have become systematic and widespread, reaching appalling levels of brutality.

That is not a guarantee, but a strong likelihood.   We were extremely disappointed to see the Jan. 29 editorial cartoon by Tom Toles. Using the likeness of a service member who has lost his arms and legs in war as the central theme of a cartoon was beyond tasteless. Editorial cartoons are often designed to exaggerate issues, and The Post is obviously free to address any topic, including the state of readiness of the armed forces. However, The Post and Mr. Toles have done a disservice to readers and to The Post's reputation by using such a callous depiction of those who volunteered to defend this nation and, as a result, suffered traumatic and life-altering wounds. Those who visit wounded veterans in hospitals have found lives profoundly changed by pain and loss. They also have found brave men and women with a sense of purpose and selfless commitment that causes battle-hardened warriors to pause. While The Post and some of its readers may not agree with the war or its conduct, these men and women and their families are owed the decency of not having a cartoon make light of their tremendous physical sacrifices.

        "justification": " Claim:  Researchers at Stanford University have found a cure for Alzheimer's disease. MOSTLY FALSE Examples:  [Collected via e-mail, January 2015]\n\nCan you verify any truth to this article claiming a 'cure' has been found for Alzheimer's.  The link is circulating widely on Facebook.\nThanks.\n\n   Origins:  On 8 December 2014, the UK newspaper the Telegraph published an article  article titled \"Has Stanford University Found a Cure for Alzheimer's disease?\" That article referenced a study just published in Journal of Clinical Investigation titled \"Prostaglandin signaling suppresses beneficial microglial function in Alzheimer's disease models.\" titled Owing in part to the pain inflicted by Alzheimer's disease on both its sufferers and their loved ones, the Telegraph's coverage of the Stanford study spread rapidly by users of social media inspired by the hopeful headline. Many were led by the Telegraph's article title alone to believe a cure for Alzheimer's disease had been discovered or was imminent. However, the article's first few lines revealed a slightly less certain (albeit incredibly positive) development in the field of Alzheimer's research: \n\nAlzheimer's could be prevented and even cured by boosting the brain's own immune response, new research suggests. Researchers at Standford University discovered that nerve cells die because cells which are supposed to clear the brain of bacteria, viruses and dangerous deposits stop working. Scientists have shown that blocking the protein allows the microglia to function normally again so they can hoover up the dangerous sticky amyloid-beta The researchers found that, in mice, blocking EP2 with a drug reversed memory loss and myriad other Alzheimer's-like features in the animals.\n As the quoted portion above illustrates, the \"Alzheimer's cure\" teased in the headline is not in fact an advance currently applicable to humans. The study's abstract was markedly more cautious in its framing, using words such as \"suggest,\" \"potential,\" and \"prevent progression to [Alzheimer's disease],\" signaling significant additional research will be required before the findings could be applied to anything that could reasonably be considered a \"cure\" for Alzheimer's in human beings: \n\nOur findings indicate that EP2 signaling suppresses beneficial microglia functions that falter during AD development and suggest that inhibition of the COX/PGE2/EP2 immune pathway has potential as a strategy to restore healthy microglial function and prevent progression to AD.\n\n The Stanford study could prove valuable in the ongoing effort to inhibit the toll that Alzheimer's takes on its victims, but even if a cure or a treatment were to result from that research, it likely remains a decade or more away:  remains \n\nThe Stanford study focused on a protein called EP2 found on a brain cell called microglia that manages inflammation and anti-inflammatory responses. It dovetails on previous work that has linked brain inflammation and Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, the study may not lead to a treatment for at least a decade if it happens at all. The Telegraph article attracted considerable attention on social media, along with \"anguished\" emails from the loved ones of people affected by the disease, according to Bruce Goldman, a spokesman for Stanford Medical School. Said Goldman: \"They need cures as soon as they can get them, but science has to proceed in an orderly fashion.\"\n \n\n\n\n  Last updated:  14 January 2015\n ",

        "justification": "Claim:   According to magazine polls, the three things blacks fear most are dogs, ghosts, and registered mail. FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, March 2008] \nTwo different magazines, Country Living (99.99% white readership) and EBONY/Jet (99.99% black readership) did surveys on 'WHAT DO PEOPLE FEAR MOST'? The results were interesting, to say the least... Country Living magazine's top three answers were:\n1. Nuclear war/terrorist attack in U.S.\n2. Child/spouse dying/terminal illness.\n3. Terminal illness/self. EBONY/Jet magazine's top three answers were:\n1. Ghosts.\n2. Dogs.\n3. Registered mail. Variations:  A February 2010 version added two more items to each list:  Country Living:\n4.  Unemployment.\n5.  Further economic downturn. Ebony / Jet:\n4.  Law enforcement.\n5.  Father's Day. Origins:  Variously titled \"Interesting Survey Results\" and \"What Do People Fear Most?\", this canard about magazines surveying what their readers fear most has been landing in our inbox since March 2008. None of the publications named therein  Country Living, Ebony, or Jet  ran such a survey and obtained the listed results. Country Living Gardening, decor, entertaining, crafts, and antiques are the primary areas of interest covered by Country Living, which would make such a poll appear to be an especially bad fit for that publication.  (Ebony and Jet cover a wider range of topics. While Ebony and Jet are different magazines that service a primarily black readership, they are both produced by Johnson Publishing and share a joint web site, ebonyjet.com.) ebonyjet.com The racial denigration in the piece is obvious: When white folks worry, they concern themselves with weighty matters (nuclear war, terrorist attack, loss of loved ones, their own mortality), but when black people fret, their anxiety focuses on far less dire things (ghosts, dogs, registered mail). Moreover, says the fake poll, the fears of white people mostly involve dangers that threaten others as well as themselves, but black people worry about things that are strictly limited to the individual. Black people are therefore not only laughably trivial in their concerns, but also wholly self-involved. Yet the racism doesn't stop there: The three things blacks supposedly fear most are also all items associated with racial stereotypes. Ghosts are on the list because among the many negative characteristics attributed to blacks that worked to position them as childish was a purported terror of \"haunts\" or \"spooks.\" (This stereotype was so widely accepted that it found its way into numerous films made in the 1930s and 1940s.) Man's best friend makes the list because dogs were used to track escaped slaves and run them to the ground, and in more recent times by police to break up civil rights marches and protests. Puzzling to some readers is the inclusion of \"registered mail\" on the list. That entry presupposes the only kind of mail a black person would have to sign for is the sort no one would want to receive: dunning letters from collection agencies and lawyers, summonses to appear in court, formal demands for overdue child support, and the like. (White folks apparently get only the good kind of registered mail, such as secure delivery of their stock certificates or news of bequests left them in dear old Uncle Egbert's will.)

As a result, we are at a loss as to the origins of the false claim that \"Starbucks says defund the police.\" The company has on several occasions articulated support for the Black Lives Matter movement and opposition to racial injustice, but that is clearly not the same as supporting the \"defund the police\" campaign.  several occasions articulated support Black Lives Matter We found no evidence that Starbucks supports the \"defund the police\" campaign.

We highlighted the portion that was lifted directly from the book's description: Great new book out by Jesse Watters, How I Saved the World.

Get your copy today, congratulations Jesse! Trump's statement did not contain any punctuation to indicate that this was a quote, nor was this plagiarized portion of his statement preceded by any indications that this was a quote from the book's promotional copy. As written, it appeared that Trump was giving a personal testimony about Watters' book, but that is not the case.  Trump was banned from social media in the days following the attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, as the companies feared that the former president might incite more violence by pushing falsehoods about his election loss on their platforms. Without social media, Trump has started to issue statements via email which are then reposted to social media by his supporters and journalists. As social media users can't see these statements posted on Trump's own timeline for themselves, they are often left wondering if they are authentic.  We've been asked about a few of these statements in the past. For example: Yes, Trump wished a happy Father's Day to the \"the losers of the world,\" and yes, he wished a Happy Easter to the \"radical left crazies.\" the losers of the world, radical left crazies",

We did attempt to prevent the damage, throwing stones at, and hitting, the attacker. The attacker could not be dissuaded, and kept up his assault for eight hours. The incident even caused a traffic situation in front of the house. The damage consisted of:\n1) The loss of about two inches from the left horn. The broken piece is on the work bench in the garage.\n2) Hoof scratches on the side of the Bison.\n3) Some chips in the right rear hoof.\n4) Blood stains behind the Bison.

As screenshots of McDaniel's posts went viral, many social media users took the opportunity to criticize McDaniel, saying he had received his comeuppance for calling the virus a political ploy.  McDaniel's wife, Lisa, acknowledged that her husband had made some \"early assumptions\" about the virus on social media, but added that social media users were also making unfair assumptions about him.  In a statement posted to the Snyder Funeral Homes Facebook page that announced services for McDaniel would not be live-streamed due to concerns about unwanted, negative social media reactions, she explained that McDaniel, like many others, was initially not fully aware of the severity of the pandemic. However, she wrote that he ordered the employees at his company O&M to work from home on March 16 (the day after the above-displayed Facebook post).

We are overwhelmed with grief for the loss of our believed husband, father, soon to be father-in-law, son, brother, uncle, and dear friend to many. Similar to thousands of people, we are suffering from an unexpected and untimely loss due to the effects of COVID-19, the likes of which we never could have imagined. During this time of mourning, John's story, along with early assumptions that he stated on Twitter and Facebook have turned into national news. The news has opened the flood gates for people to share their own misguided anger and unfounded assumptions about a man they don't know. Wanting to protect my family and John's legacy, we have decided not to live stream his funeral services via Facebook today. We will be privately recording his services today and we will be sharing it directly with his family and friends. We have not come to this decision lightly and we hope everyone will honor and respect this decision.  As each day passes, we all are learning more about this \"invisible enemy.\" We have all learned that the early actions taken by our National and State government were indeed the right action to take. Quarantine and social distancing have been effective in flattening the curve. John, President of O&M, ordered the company to work from home on March 16. In addition, it is important to note that John immediately self-isolated as soon as he learned he had been in contact with someone who had tested positive. Many, like John, made statements early on not fully aware of the severity of COVID-19; many have retracted their statements knowing now the effects of this pandemic. We know if John was still here with us he would acknowledge the national crisis we're are in, abide by the stay-at-home order, and encourage family and friends to do the same. But sadly he is not with us and we will forever have to live and cope with how his life ended far too soon. Further, we will never be able to erase from our hears and minds the negative posts that have been made and shared about John this past week. To all of our family and friends, my sons and I will never be able to appropriately say \"thank you\" for all the love and support you have given us throughout this entire process. From the bottom of our hearts we will forever be grateful for you and the special relationship we share. While some may cast aspersions on McDaniel for not treating COVID-19 with the seriousness it deserved in March 2020, it should be noted that misinformation has been rampant during this pandemic. rampant We've debunked scores of rumors over several months that have touted bad medical advice and promoted conspiracy theories. U.S. President Donald Trump, too, has been criticized for downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19 and has repeatedly called the news outlets outlets covering this pandemic \"fake news.\" On Feb. 28, just two weeks before McDaniel posted on social media that COVID-19 was a \"political ploy,\" Trump said during a rally that \"Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus\" as their \"new hoax.\"  bad medical advice conspiracy theories. fake news said Brown, Bruce.  \"Its Dangerous for Public Officials to Cry Fake News During the COVID-19 Pandemic.\"\r\n  Miami Herald.  27 March 2020.

            "Did a youngster tell Bozo to 'Cram it, clown' on live TV?"
        ],
        "justification": "Legend:  A youngster who fails in his efforts to win a treasure chest full of toys on a live Bozo the Clown show expresses his displeasure by exclaiming \"Cram it, clown!\"  Example:  [Los Angeles Times, 1994] \n\n\nOne of the prevailing urban myths among '60s Southern California youth was that, on one televised Bozo show, things got out of hand. A child playing Bozo Buckets reputedly accompanied a missed shot with a choice swear word. To which Bozo replied, \"That's a Bozo No-no.\" To which the child then reportedly responded, \"Aw, cram it, Clownie!\"\n\n\n Variations:\n\n The city in which the show took place varies, with Chicago and Boston being the two most frequently mentioned.  The contest at which the child contestant failed also varies; versions include the youngster's losing at a ping pong ball toss, a ball-in-bucket game, a block-building contest, an egg race, and even a quiz.  The tyke's retort to Bozo's attempt to console him is said to be one of \"Cram it, clown!\"; \"Ram it, clownie\"; \"Fuck off, clown!\"; and even \"Right here, Bozo!\" (while pointing at his crotch).\n Origins:  This tale certainly has all the hallmarks of an apocryphality:   No one seems to agree on the city in which the show took place, when the incident occurred, what game the child was competing at, and what \"naughty phrase\" the contestant blurted out.  Moreover, this same story has been told about not just Bozo the Clown specifically, but about nearly every town's local clown show.  (There was no one Bozo the Clown show; many different markets each had its own \"Bozo\" show, produced locally and featuring a different actor as Bozo.)  In short, there's no reason to believe this is anything than yet another made-up bit of television lore that has now become so ubiquitous many people are convinced they actually saw it take place. The legend has been advanced as true in recent years by none other than Larry Harmon, the purported creator of Bozo and the original portrayer of the red-haired clown on television.  Harmon claimed in a 1996 article (the year that marked the fiftieth anniversary of Bozo's creation) that the \"Cram it!\" incident occurred while he was producing Boston's local Bozo the Clown show \"in the early sixties,\" and he reiterated the same claim a few years later for a TV Guide piece on television legends: \n\n[TV Guide, 1998] It took place during a game, Bozo's Treasure Chest, which boasted a huge cache of toys as a prize. \"One day this young, underprivileged kid was competing and his eyes were as big as saucers looking at those toys,\" Harmon recalls. The boy had to toss three Ping-Pong balls into a barrel. He landed the first two, but missed the third. The show's ringmaster said to the boy, \"You're never a loser on the Bozo show, you're just an almost-winner,\" and handed him a Bozo towel as a consolation prize. \"The kid looks at the towel,\" Harmon says, \"he looks at the ringmaster, then looks at Bozo and says, 'Cram it, clown!'\" Bozo's response? \"That's a Bozo no-no.\"\n Larry Harmon has some credibility issues, however.  First of all, although Harmon stated that he's been \"asked about the story for years,\" he apparently didn't start claiming it was true until it had been circulating for nearly three decades.  Secondly, although he has repeatedly identified himself as both the   creator of Bozo and the first person to portray Bozo on television, he is in fact neither of those things.\n(Bozo was created for Capitol Records in 1946 by Alan W. Livingston, and he was first portrayed on television for Los Angeles station KTTV in 1949 by Pinto Colvig.   Harmon now claims that he did not assert he was Bozo's creator and that he has been \"misquoted and blatantly misrepresented\" in numerous newspaper articles.)  Most importantly, the details of this  incident as recalled by Harmon don't check out: the Boston Bozo show had no \"ringmaster,\" and no one else connected with the show (including the man who portrayed the Boston Bozo from 1958 to 1970, Frank Avruch) remembers anything about it. This legend is plausible in that most of the Bozo shows were broadcast live, and thus an incident like this could have made it onto the air.  Moreover, the Boston Bozo program was syndicated to markets that didn't have their own Bozo show, which could account for people in several different cities all reportedly having seen the same thing.  (As well, this isn't the type of incident whose non-appearance in media reports would be surprising; a tot acting up on a local children's TV show isn't exactly big news.)  Nonetheless, the legend appears to have originated around 1964 or 1965, spread by word of mouth and (like the apocryphal Uncle Don remark) eventually \"re-created\" for a bloopers record that purportedly included all \"authentic\" material.  It demonstrates both the pitfalls of live television and the difficulties working with children, and it features a common role-switching juxtaposition: the sophisticated youngster who dishes out a grown-up's rebuke to a mild, cloying adult character.  While very young children still enjoy characters such as Barney the dinosaur and Ronald McDonald, older children have increasingly seen them as worthy targets of verbal and physical abuse: perhaps a symptom of our youngsters' more rapid loss of innocence in today's society.

Follow our post-election coverage here. here In late December 2020, social media users shared a meme claiming that the transition team for U.S. President-elect Joe Biden was \"removed\" from the Pentagon for leaking intelligence to the Chinese government:   The text of the meme reads: Last week the Biden transition team was removed from the Pentagon and now we know why. The Secretary of Defense gave disinformation to the Biden team about Naval movements in the South China Sea. Within 30 minutes the intel was leaked to the CCP. Anyone that is okay with this needs to have their head checked. Biden is in bed with China. Notably, the meme didn't include any evidence to support its claims  and there is no evidence that Biden's team was \"removed\" from the Pentagon or had leaked any intelligence to the Chinese Communist Party, the ruling political party in China. Had such a stunning event actually happened, we'd doubtlessly see mainstream news coverage. We found no credible news reports that the incoming presidential administration leaked intelligence to China, which would be a bombshell report. In fact, it's been an ongoing issue that outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump has not only refused to admit his electoral loss in the Nov. 3, 2020, election, but his administration has also demonstrated an unprecedented lack of cooperation with the incoming administration. cooperation On Dec. 18, 2020, Axios reported that Trump's acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller had \"ordered a Pentagon-wide halt to cooperation with the transition of President-elect Biden, shocking officials across the Defense Department,\" citing \"senior administration officials.\" reported Miller said in a statement that his staff had been cooperating, and would continue to do so after a \"mutually-agreed upon holiday pause.\" Biden's team responded by stating Miller's comments were false and that they had never agreed on a holiday break in transition meetings. statement Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a Dec. 29, 2020, interview with NPR that Trump's political appointees have continued to obstruct the transition process and haven't turned over vital information pertaining to things like a massive Russian cyberattack against American government agencies or plans to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to the American public. interview Biden called the lack of cooperation from the Trump administration \"nothing short, in my view, of irresponsibility.\" called",

        "justification": "On Feb. 28, 2021, former U.S. President Donald Trump gave a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), marking his first major appearance since vacating the White House roughly six weeks earlier. Conservative Political Action Conference Afterwards, some viewers interpreted his remarks to include an announcement of a 2024 presidential campaign following his loss to Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden in 2020. following   Overall, Trump's roughly 95-minute speech in Florida attacked Republicans who strayed from his political agenda, criticized Biden's first few weeks in office, and perpetuated lies about the November 2020 election. 2020 election Specifically, Trump attempted to convince the crowd that his opponents coordinated an illicit scheme to push him out of the White House  when, in reality, Biden secured the job because more Americans in battleground states voted for him instead of Trump. And mixed with the lies and vitriol were remarks that teased the possibility of a 2024 Trump presidential campaign. For example, after about 16 minutes on stage, the former president said, according to CSPAN's video recording and a transcript of the event: CSPAN's video recording transcript \"I may even decide to beat [Democrats] for a third time. Okay? For a third time.\" At other points, he pointed to Biden's track record as alleged evidence of Americans' voting for a Republican candidate next election. And I wonder who that will be, he said. Who, who, who will that be? I wonder. Shortly after the speech, Trump told a reporter with Newsmax, a media outlet popular among his supporters, that while he doubts anyone could beat him if he decided to launch a presidential campaign again, \"I haven't decided to do that.\" with Newsmax   In other words, Trump did not use the CPAC stage -- nor any other platform -- to announce plans to run in 2024, as of this writing. And in at least one interview he confirmed that he had not made up his mind on whether to place another bid for the White House. Furthermore, no email to supporters soliciting donations, merchandise on TrumpStore.com, or page on his official website said he was running again or advertised \"Trump 2024\" products. (Other retailers are selling such items, similarly to how his supporters are sporting \"Patriot Party\" memorabilia even though the Trump campaign attempted to distance itself from the name.) official website retailers Patriot Party distance In sum, while his statements at the conference purposefully left the door open to the possibility of a 2024 Trump campaign, Trump did not officially announce one. For that reason, we rate this claim \"False.\"",

FALSE Examples:  [Collected via email, September 2014] \nNetflix has announced that they have filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, and will be shutting down most of their services by the end of the year.\n\n   \nThere is a rumour netflix is going bankrupt  due to piracy. Is this true?\n\n    Origins:  On 18 August, a tale began slowly wending its way around the internet. An article claimed that Netflix, a widely-used content-streaming service, would be closing its virtual doors due to the ease with which films and TV shows can be pirated. The incipient loss of what has rapidly become an American entertainment stalwart spooked a great many social media users. The Netflix bankruptcy article began to pick up steam in mid-September 2014, with a bit of panic spiking on sites like Facebook and Twitter over the rumor.  Empire News, a common source for these sorts of somewhat-plausible fake news stories, published the article titled \"Netflix Files For Bankruptcy, Claims They Can't Compete With Piracy 'Industry'.\" One clue to its dubious veracity comes from this quote: Netflix Files For Bankruptcy, Claims They Can't Compete With Piracy 'Industry' \n\"When we started, this system was gold, but now people can get their content anywhere,\" said Carl Kazaa, CEO of Netflix. \"With the leak of The Expendables 3 a few weeks ago cutting massively into the profits of the film's box office take, we realized that customers don't care about 99% of the films we have streaming at all. They want new films, movies that aren't even released to theatres yet. They can't wait anymore. They just can't wait. A subscriber will drop us the second they discover they can get a movie free from the bowels of the internet. Especially if it's a film we don't have available.\"\n\n   Netflix's well-known CEO is not Carl Kazaa, but Reed Hastings. \"Kazaa\" was the name of a now-defunct peer-to-peer file-sharing service once used for, among other things, sharing pirated material.

        "justification": "Claim:  E-mail requests birthday cards for  Alyssa Bruno, a 5-year-old girl who is battling diffuse pontine glioma. \nStatus:  Was true; now outdated\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, 2006] \n\n\nHi Friends, Family, Colleagues and Random People who got on my email list! As many of you are aware, this past school year one of my kindergartners, Alyssa Bruno, was diagnosed with diffuse pontine glioma (stem cell brain tumor). She had a successful year of kindergarten, but took a dramatic turn for the worse at the end of the school year. As of now she has lost all movement in her left side and can't walk or talk. She has been on five different chemotherapy treatments and continues to be a little trooper! Everyone is praying that this upcoming week's dose of chemo will show some signs of improvement. On August 2nd Alyssa will be celebrating her 6th birthday. I've been thinking for a long time about what to get for her, but she is very limited with what she can do right now. One thing Alyssa LOVES is to get mail. So I thought I'd email everyone on my list and ask for you all to send Alyssa a birthday card. How neat would that be for Alyssa to receive cards from all over the country and perhaps the world! I'd love it if you all could also forward this message to everyone on your list. (I'm not a fan of chain letters, but this would really make Alyssa's day!) If you send a card please enclose a penny for \"good luck\"! I am going to have Alyssa collect them in a jar as a reminder of all the people who are out there praying for her. I know how busy everyone is these days, but sending a card to Alyssa would really help to brighten her long days during these next few hot months of summer. It will give her a little something to look forward to each day when she gets the mail. I've attached a few pictures so that you can put a face with the name! She's a cutie! :) Try to forward this to anyone who you think would send a card! Thank you so much,\nMarcy Mooney  Alyssa's Address:\nAlyssa Bruno\n67 Cascade Road\nWest Henrietta, NY 14586  First picture is Alyssa on the first day of kindergarten. Next is this summer  a \"Fun Day\" in June. \n\n   \n\n   Origins:  Alyssa Bruno, a 5-year old girl from West Henrietta, New York, was diagnosed with diffuse pontine glioma, a type of tumor originating at the base of the brain.  The median age at diagnosis of such tumors is about 5 to 10 years old, and gliomas account for about 10% of all childhood central nervous system and brain tumors.  Typical symptoms of diffuse pontine glioma include  diffuse pontine glioma difficulty walking; muscle weakness in the arms and legs (particularly on one side of the body); difficulty in controlling eye movements, facial expressions, chewing, and swallowing; speech problems; hearing loss; drowsiness; and personality changes.  Unfortunately, the prognosis for glioma patients is not good: The tumors cannot be treated surgically (because they grow in between and around normal brain cells,  and removing them interferes with critical brain functions); median survival time from diagnosis is less than one year, and the two-year survival rate is currently less than 20%.  Alyssa held up well through her first year of chemotherapy, but in January 2006 her tumor started to grow, and she has lost the ability to walk, talk, or move the left side of her body.  A friend of the family helped speed FDA approval for Alyssa's doctors to try a drug produced in Cuba that has seemingly evidenced some success in treating diffuse pontine glioma, and the treatment appears to have slowed the aggression of her tumor a little. On 18 July 2006, with Alyssa due to celebrate her 6th birthday in a few weeks (2 August 2006), her kindergarten teacher, Marcy Mooney, sent out the above-quoted appeal for birthday cards with good luck pennies because she  \"wanted to do something special that [Alyssa] could enjoy despite her limitations.\"  As of the end of July 2006, Alyssa had reportedly received over 10,000 cards from across the U.S. and other countries, as well as a variety of gifts: \n\nAlyssa now has more than 10,000 cards from just about everywhere in the U.S. Some cards came from Brazil and Barbados.  \"It was kind of out of the box kind of thing to do for her birthday. I didn't even think when I put her address and her pictures up on the Internet that it would be all over the world,\" said Mooney. \"It's a lot for them. It's so much fun opening cards, so they're letting neighbors and friends and everybody open the cards.\"  Some have sent flowers, toys and bears. Most of the cards have also included a penny for good luck.\n Members of the Federation of Social Workers donated 180 vacation days so that Alyssa's mother (who is a social worker herself) could stay home and take care of Alyssa, and they also took over the task of handling the burgeoning piles of cards and gifts mailed to Alyssa from around the world.  By the date of Alyssa's birthday, her family had received around 20,000 cards, and the Federation had collected about another 3,000.   The outpouring of sympathy and good wishes that accompanied the thousands of cards and presents sent to Alyssa helped to brighten her final days, as she finally succumbed to cancer and passed away on 24 August 2006, just three weeks after her sixth birthday.

            "Are Raspberry Ultra Drops a scam?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Raspberry Ultra Drops have been vetted by Fox News and endorsed by Dr. Oz.  FALSE  Examples:  [Collected via e-mail, June 2013] \nPlease report on the new diet supplement that Dr. Oz is touting called Raspberry Ultra Drops  I would like to know if this is a scam of some kind.\n \n Fox News Breaking News Raspberry Ultra Drops To Help Your Weight Drop Was the above product  advertised on Dr Oz show? If yes, is it true that these drops make you lose weight? I received an email with Dr. Oz saying these drops work.  Was this email true or was it a form of spam?\n Origins:  Raspberry Ultra Drops are a dietary supplement based on raspberry ketones (an organic compound found in many fruits which can also be produced synthetically).  The product is promoted as a \"weight management supplement\" which is full of \"fat-burning ingredients\" that can \"help detox your body.\" Raspberry Ultra Drops are frequently advertised in spammed e-mail and Facebook posts with links to what appear to be Fox News investigations of Raspberry Ultra Drops or promote the endorsement of television's popular medical advise dispenser, Dr. Oz: Raspberry Ultra Drops investigations endorsement Dr. Oz  In general, any company touting a raspberry ketone product as a miracle weight loss product is dubious, as WebMD notes that no studies in humans have demonstrated raspberry ketones to be effective for that purpose (or established their safety): studies \nRaspberry ketones (RK) are the chemical compounds that give raspberries their enticing aroma. And when ketones are taken from raspberries, they can be used to add fragrance and flavor to things such as colas, ice cream, and cosmetics. But the buzz that has put raspberry ketones in the spotlight is the claim that raspberry ketone supplements can melt away fat and prevent weight gain  even in the face of a high-fat diet. But can they really do that? The answer is no one knows. Experts say that investing anywhere from $12 to $20 in a bottle of raspberry ketone supplements amounts to little more than wishful thinking. And doing so may or may not be harmful. There have been no human studies so far on the weight loss effects of raspberry ketones. The only studies on the effect of raspberry ketones on fat are a handful of animal studies. The studies were done over the last 10 to 15 years. Researchers looked at the effect of raspberry ketones on rats, mice, and rabbits. There are also a few studies on the effect of raspberry ketones on isolated cells in test tubes. But there is no way to know whether the same results would be produced in people. In the animal studies, raspberry ketones also seemed to affect the production of certain hormones that increase the body's ability to burn fat. But whether raspberry ketones would have the same effect on metabolism and hormone production in humans hasn't been studied. Until it has, experts say you're better off holding onto your money.\n More important, whatever the medical or weight loss benefits of raspberry ketones may be, the Raspberry Ultra Drops product has been the target of multiple complaints of fraudulent and deceptive activity, including: \n The use of spam (and Facebook hacking) as an advertising method. Facebook hacking  The use of deceptive advertising which suggests to viewers that news investigations have checked out Raspberry Ultra Drops and found it to be effective.  (The ads are fake mock-ups that emulate the appearance of web pages from real news outlets.) news investigations  The use of deceptive advertising which suggests to viewers that Dr. Oz has endorsed Raspberry Ultra Drops.  Although Dr. Oz has promoted the notion that raspberry ketones in general  promoted may have beneficial medical or weight loss effects in some people, he has not specifically endorsed the Raspberry Ultra Drops product. (The tiny disclaimer on the Raspberry Ultra Drops web page notes that \"The Dr. Oz Show is not affiliated with and does not sponsor or endorse the products or services of Raspberry Ketone Fat-Loss Formula.\")  The use of multiple similar web sites under different domain names, all of which link to an ordering page which is hosted in a foreign country (and is therefore beyond the reach of U.S. authorities). ordering page  The use of deceptive advertising which reproduces the very same fake customer \"testimony\" in connection a variety of different products.  (That is, in one ad \"Karen from Santa Ana\" makes the very same positive statements about Raspberry Ultra Drops that \"Sharon from Little Rock\" makes in a different ad for iHCG Pro Drops.)  Many, many complaints from customers who ordered Raspberry Ultra Drops and never received their orders, received something that appeared to have little or no active ingredients, were charged for additional orders even after the \"trial period\" had ended, and were unable to reach the company to cancel or return their orders.\n complaints In short, consumers who want raspberry ketones (for whatever reason) should look for something other than the Raspberry Ultra Drops product.  And most consumers who are interested in a reliable and effective method for losing weight should consider concentrating on a healthy, balanced diet and regular exercise rather than tossing their money at an unproved fat-burning nostrum.

            "Single data points presented without context do not interfere with the scientific consensus on climate change."
        ],
        "justification": "On 1 October 2017, pseudoscientific alternative health website NaturalNews.com, which is geared primarily toward supplement enthusiasts with a discerning taste for deep state conspiracy theories, posted an article (\"Dont Look Now, But Arctic Sea Ice Mass Has Grown Almost 40% Since 2012\") that attempts to cast doubt on the scientific veracity of global warming by first presenting the following grotesque caricature of a straw man argument: article straw man One of the most popular pieces of \"evidence\" that climate alarmists just love to bring up to prove the global warming narrative is the \"all the ice is melting in the Arctic and the polar bears are dying\" line. Weve all seen the documentaries where a polar bear is desperately clinging to a tiny piece of ice and you just know hes going to die soon. They article then presents two observations that make the generally factual point that there has been relatively more sea ice in the Arctic and glacial ice on Greenland in 2017 than there have been at specific times in the recent past: The latest figures from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, located at the University of Colorado, show that sea ice extent has increased by 40 percent since 2012. [...] [The Danish Polar Portal reports that]: If we rank the annual surface mass balance since 1981 from low to high, the lowest on record was 2011-2012 (38 Gt) and this year is the 5th highest out of the 37 year record. Danish Polar Portal To be clear, the primary data scientists use to document global warming are records of Earth's temperature over time, not doomed polar bear imagery. Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist for the independent, nongovernmental Berkeley Earth research group told us in an e-mail that, in this area, pretty much \"all groups who provide estimates\" of global temperature unequivocally point to nearly uninterrupted temperature rises since the 1970s, as shown in this comparison of various estimates produced by the climate and energy policy website Carbon Brief: Zeke Hausfather produced   \"People interested in global warming are best-served looking at actual global temperatures,\" Hausfather said. While this temperature trend is uncontroversial and clear, the climate system as a whole is a complex beast with numerous entangled parts. The basic approach to writing a blog post that \"debunks\" the concept of global warming is to highlight without explanation various parts of that system at a single point in time. NaturalNews.com is no exception to that basic strategy here. Arctic Sea Ice Natural News cites a climate change denial blog called ClimateDepot.com as evidence of the claim that sea ice has grown 40 percent since 2012. In reality, the claim made by this website was more specific and less useful. In a post dated 18 September 2017, Climate Depot stated: stated Arctic sea ice extent is up 40% from this date five years ago. \"Sea ice extent\" is one of many different metrics used to characterize the presence of sea ice, and is generally defined as \"the area of ocean [based on pixels in satellite imagery] where at least 15 percent of the surface is frozen\". On the day of 17 September 2017, sea ice extent was indeed higher than it was on 17 September 2012: defined   This does not mean, however, that sea ice has grown almost 40 percent since 2012, nor does it mean that the overall trend in arctic sea ice is toward growth  it hasn't and it isn't. The issue here is that sea ice extent is quite variable from year to year, and thus looking at two discrete points is a fairly useless exercise without the full context. \"We don't expect it to monotonically decrease every year,\" Hausfather told us.  This chart (using data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center) shows September sea ice extent compared against the same average used in the maps cited by Climate Depot, showing both this aforementioned variability but also an overall trend of reduced ice extent. Note that the year 2012 was no random year to select for comparison; it is actually the record lowest year in terms of Arctic sea ice extent  making anything compared to it necessarily higher: from   The overall trend of declining sea ice is even clearer when you look at a different measure: sea ice volume (presented by the Polar Science Center, below). Not only do such records show a clear negative trend, they also show just how anomalous 2012 was as a data point: Polar Science Center   In reality, 2017 was the eighth lowest year on record for Arctic sea ice extent since satellite measurements began in 1978. But in no world but the pseudo-scientific fringe internet would the concept of global warming rely on every single year breaking the previous year's record for sea ice minimum. eighth Tom Karl, the former director of NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information, told us that 2017's sea ice extent was still much lower than the 1980-2010 average (by two standard deviations), and that, despite claims to the contrary, \"one can't look at a trend over 5 years and say much about the impact of global warming as other factors are also important on these short time scales.\" director Glacial Ice on Greenland The NaturalNews.com approach for glacial ice on Greenland was similarly lacking scale and context. The main source for these arguments was a completely legitimate end-of-year report put out by the Danish Polar Portal, a website run by the Danish Meteorological Institute. In that report, the organization makes this factual statement: report Heavy snow and rain in winter with a relatively short and intermittent summer melt season have left the Greenland ice sheet with more ice than has been usual over the last twenty years  in fact we have to go back to the 1980s and 90s to see a year similar to this one in terms of snow fall and ice melt. This statement, and the figures presented by NaturalNews.com, are referring to a metric known as Surface Mass Balance (SMB), which Polar Portal describes: describes Each year glaciers gain ice from snow and freezing rain and lose ice by melt that runs off. Adding these together gives the surface mass budget (SMB) in Greenland, the ice sheet typically gains mass from around September to May and loses more mass than it gains in the ablation [melting] season of June, July and August. Importantly, however, this measurement only presents half the picture in terms of how much mass is being lost from year to year from Greenland's glaciers. That's because it does not include the rather significant portion of ice that breaks  or calves  off into the ocean to melt elsewhere. On average this accounts for about 500 Gt [gigatons] of further ice loss. This, as stated in the Polar Portal post, nearly matches the estimated gain in SMB reported by Natural News, effectively canceling it out. In a post on Carbon Brief, analysts with the Danish Meteorological Society put this years measurement in context: post While the Greenland ice sheet has seen a neutral, or small positive, change in ice for this year, it should be noted that Greenland has lost approximately 3,600bn tonnes of ice since 2002. Like the record of Arctic sea ice earlier, when put in the context of the entire trend of Greenland's ice mass over time (presented by Polar Portal below), 2017's measurement does nothing to change larger and completely unambiguous trends of overall melting: Polar Portal  \n  Further, in the case of Greenland's ice sheet, there is not much of a mystery surrounding the lackluster amount of melting this year; a massive storm  the remnants of Hurricane Nicole  parked itself atop the continent, dumping a large amount of snow on the ice-covered continent: Hurricane Nicole dumping Heavy rain and snow in October in especially eastern Greenland gave record totals of precipitation in the main east coast town of Tasiilaq as the remnants of former hurricane Nicole passed by and, much as with Harvey in Houston this year, got lodged over eastern Greenland for some days. However, after Nicoles extreme precipitation, the rest of the winter was actually pretty average in terms of the amount of snow that fell. Because neither the higher-than-2012 arctic sea ice from 17 September 2017 nor the neutral amount of ice loss in Greenland in 2017 do anything to disrupt the overall trends of decreasing ice, and because climatological science does not require (nor does it expect) ice or temperature records to be broken every single year, we rank the claim that these observations are reasons to doubt the tenets of climate change as false.

            "In the late 2000s, the former U.S. Vice President sometimes inaccurately represented studies that predicted the timeline for an ice-free Arctic."
        ],
        "justification": "In the years 2007, 2008, and 2009, Al Gore made statements about the possibility of a complete lack of summer sea ice in the Arctic by as early as 2013. While Gore attributed these predictions to scientists, they stemmed from a selective reading of aggressive estimates regarding future melting. The comments became a popular talking point for human-cause climate change deniers in 2014 and onward when the predictions, which in some cases were overstated, did not pan out:  On 10 December 2007, in his Nobel prize acceptance speech, Gore said: acceptance speech \nLast September 21, as the Northern Hemisphere tilted away from the sun, scientists reported with unprecedented distress that the North Polar ice cap is \"falling off a cliff.\" One study estimated that it could be completely gone during summer in less than 22 years. Another new study, to be presented by U.S. Navy researchers later this week, warns it could happen in as little as 7 years.\n Here, Gore referred to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) announcement and two different climate studies, one of which became the source for his most aggressive statements. On 21 September 2007, NOAA did announce that sea ice had hit its lowest recorded point in history. The second, more aggressive estimate for when summer sea ice would disappear in the Arctic came from a conference talk at the 2007 American Geophysical Fall Meeting, which was undertaken by researchers associated with the Naval Postgraduate School and was presented later that week. The BBC reported that the study did make the prediction that Gore claimed: conference talk BBC \nScientists in the US have presented one of the most dramatic forecasts yet for the disappearance of Arctic sea ice. Their latest modelling studies indicate northern polar waters could be ice-free in summers within just 5-6 years. Professor Wieslaw Maslowski told an American Geophysical Union meeting that previous projections had underestimated the processes now driving ice loss.\n The BBC article also noted that Maslowskis group, frequently cited by Gore, often made predictions that were more aggressive than their peers': \"Professor Maslowski's group, which includes co-workers at NASA and the Institute of Oceanology, Polish Academy of Sciences (PAS), is well known for producing modelled dates that are in advance of other teams.\" On 13 December 2008, Gore appeared to have made a similarly flawed statement while speaking at the opening of a German natural history museum. Although transcripts and clear audio are hard to find, one video of the event documented Gore's saying that \"The entire North polar ice cap may well be completely gone in 5 years. Given the dates presented, it is likely that Gore was once again referring to Maslowskis data, and unless he preceded his statement with some qualification not captured by the video, Gore's statement either intentionally or accidentally neglected to mention that this prediction, aggressive as it was, concerned only summer sea ice. opening video On 14 December 2009, during a speech at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, Gore cited newer research from the same group, saying: \"These figures are fresh. Some of the models suggest to Dr [Wieslav] Maslowski that there is a 75 per cent chance that the entire north polar ice cap, during the summer months, could be completely ice-free within five to seven years.\" cited That statement put Gore in hot water when Maslowski told rhe Times of London that his data did not allow for such a prediction:   told \nIts unclear to me how this figure was arrived at, Dr Maslowski said. I would never try to estimate likelihood at anything as exact as this. Mr Gores office later admitted that the 75 per cent figure was one used by Dr Maslowksi as a ballpark figure several years ago in a conversation with Mr Gore.\n The claim that Gore predicted an ice-free Arctic in 2014 is a simplification of these events. However, Gore was definitely guilty in these cases of cherry-picking science or playing loose with the details of that science. Gores statements gained the most viral attention in 2014 and 2015, both because these were years in which Gores statements implied an ice-free summer in the Arctic and because those years had relatively more arctic sea ice than preceding years. relatively more From a broad perspective, however, summer sea ice in the Arctic has in fact been declining at faster rates relative to 20th century, and the year 2016 tied with the year 2007 (the year highlighted by Gore in his Nobel speech) for the second least Arctic summer sea ice on record (the lowest recorded sea ice extent occurred in 2012). declining tied While the disappearance of summer sea ice is difficult to predict, a 2013 review of different approaches (including Maslowskis) summarized the range of various predictions for the first ice-free summer in the Arctic: review \nWe have investigated three approaches to predicting 21st century summer Arctic sea ice loss as represented by trendsetters, stochasters, and modelers [three quantitative approaches used to make predictions]. At present, it is not possible to completely choose one approach over another as all approaches have strengths and weaknesses ... Time horizons for summer sea ice loss of these three approaches turns out to be roughly 2020, 2030, and 2040 respectively for trendsetters, stochasters, and modelers ... It is reasonable to conclude that Arctic sea ice loss is very likely to occur in the rst rather than the second half of the 21st century, with a possibility of loss within a decade or two.\n Arctic sea ice is without question on a declining trend, but Gore definitely erred in his use of preliminary projections and misrepresentations of research. Because Gore himself did not claim to have made these predictions, however, and because his statements applied specifically to summer sea ice in the Arctic, we rate the claim that Gore \"predicted the ice caps will melt by 2014\" as a mixture.

MIXTURE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, July 2009] \nEd McMahon died this week. He was a great entertainer, but prior to his stage accomplishments he was a distinguished Marine Corps fighter pilot in WWII earning six Air Medals and attaining the rank of Colonel. He was discharged in 1946 and was later promoted to the rank of Brigadier General in the CA Air National Guard. Farrah Fawcett died this week after a long career in Hollywood as an actress. After she was diagnosed with cancer, she became an activist for cancer treatment and devoted her last remaining years encouraging people to seek treatment. She documented her plight on film and used it to encourage others to stay positive and upbeat despite their diagnosis and suffering. Michael Jackson died this week. He was perhaps one of the greatest singers of modern time. He will also be remembered for his eccentric lifestyle that included sleeping with a chimpanzee, living in a carnival-like atmosphere at Neverland, his fascination with Peter Pan, and his numerous masks and costumes. He also admitted to finding pleasure sleeping with young boys and paying out millions of dollars in settlements to the families of these boys despite being acquitted by a court on one allegation of sexual molestation. QUESTION - Which of the above did the House of Representatives declare a moment of silence for today? (Hint - It wasn't the first two.) QUESTION - Which of the above's family received a personal note of condolence from President Obama? (Hint - It wasn't the first two.) Need we say more?\n Variations:  A later version of this item included the following bit about actor Karl Malden (who died on 1 July 2009): \n\nKarl Malden died this week after a long career in Hollywood as an actor. He also served in the US Air Force during WWII and also served on the US Postal Service committee to review and recommend commemorative stamps.  In 2005, the US House of Representatives authorized the US Postal Service to rename a Los Angeles post office the Karl Malden Postal Station.\n\n Origins:  The entertainment world suffered a triple shock at the end of June 2009, when television personality Ed McMahon passed away on the 23rd of that month, a loss followed two days later by the deaths of both actress Farrah Fawcett and singer Michael Jackson.   It is true that Ed McMahon was a veteran, a decorated U.S. Marine Corps pilot who served his country during both World War II and the Korean War.  It is also true that after Farrah Fawcett was diagnosed with cancer in 2006, she became \"an outspoken advocate for early detection and  treatment of cancer\" and \"worked tirelessly to raise the profile of this disease,\" bravely allowing herself to be filmed for the harrowing Farrah's Story, a documentary that chronicled her grim fight against cancer in order to \"make viewers aware of the need for testing and research.\" Farrah's Story It is also true that neither of these celebrities was honored in their passing with the observance of a moment of silence in the U.S. Congress, and that (as far as we know) neither's family was the recipient of a personal note of condolence from the President.  In contrast, the day after Michael Jackson's death, the House of Representatives observed a moment of silence in the entertainer's honor, and a few days later senior presidential adviser David Axelrod stated that President Obama had written to the Jackson family and \"shared his feelings\" with them. observed stated However, many would take exception to the implication that Michael Jackson was merely an eccentric entertainer who, unlike Ed McMahon and Farrah Fawcett, did nothing (outside of his art) to benefit society and make him (as) worthy of the honors and recognition he received at his passing.  Michael Jackson left behind a substantial philanthropic legacy, having contributed for over twenty-five years to a long, long list of charities through donations of his time, money, and other forms of support.  As the Los Angeles Times \n\nMichael Jackson left a philanthropic legacy almost as large as his cultural one. In all the financial and personal turmoil that characterized his latter years, it was easy to lose sight of the fact that he was a pioneer not only in popular music but also in charitable fundraising within the entertainment industry. Jackson, like his close friend Elizabeth Taylor, was one of the first entertainers to enlist in the fight against AIDS/HIV, and he went on to contribute and raise hundreds of millions of dollars to help sick children, set up scholarship funds, and to find new ways for entertainers to raise money and awareness for causes. He also helped set the standard of generosity for other entertainers, particularly pop stars. His song \"We Are the World,\" which he co-wrote with Lionel Richie in 1985 to help combat famine in Africa, was instrumental in changing the way rock stars generate funds for the causes to which they're devoted. Before the financial woes that haunted him in recent years, Jackson was one of the industry's most formidable philanthropists.  Jackson's estate is expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars more over the years to come. If the will currently being treated by the courts as valid is sustained, it appears that at least 20% of the income on the trust that Jackson directed his executors establish will go to charity.\n A detailed list of Michael Jackson's many charitable efforts can be found here. here Last updated:  9 July 2009\n    Gerstein, Josh.  \"Obama Sends Condolence Letter to Jackson Family.\"\n   Politico.  28 June 2009.

            "Activists and Congressional Democrats encouraged the public to voice their opposition to the proposals, which were published in November 2019."
        ],
        "justification": "In December 2019, readers asked us about reports that claimed the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed changes to the way Social Security disability payments are made, which could cause thousands, even hundreds of thousands, to lose their benefits.  On Dec. 12, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Chicago Tribune posted an article with the headline \"Trump Administration Proposes Social Security Rule Changes That Could Cut Off Thousands of Disabled Recipients.\" The article reported that: Inquirer Tribune \"The Trump administration is proposing changes to Social Security that could terminate disability payments to hundreds of thousands of Americans, particularly older people and children. The new rule would change aspects of disability reviews  the methods by which the Social Security Administration determines whether a person continues to qualify for benefits. Few recipients are aware of the proposal, which is open for public comment through January.\" The left-leaning website Common Dreams published an article with the headline \"'A National Disgrace': Trump Proposes Social Security Change That Could End Disability Benefits for Hundreds of Thousands.'\" That story reported: article \"Activists are working to raise public awareness and outrage over a little-noticed Trump administration proposal that could strip life-saving disability benefits from hundreds of thousands of people by further complicating the way the Social Security Administration determines who is eligible for payments.\" On the face of it, the changes proposed by the Trump administration would not, in fact, directly or immediately strip disability benefits from thousands of would-be recipients, rather the changes would introduce more (and more frequent) eligibility reviews for those who wish to receive them. However, some critics have argued that those increased bureaucratic requirements would over-burden some would-be recipients, in particular especially vulnerable recipients, and would ultimately (albeit indirectly) result in thousands losing disability benefits.  The Social Security Administration distributes disability benefits in two principle ways: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their previous Social Security tax contributions and history of work, and is paid out of the Social Security insurance fund; and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their disability status and inability to work, and is paid out of general tax coffers.  ways In order to prevent potential abuse and waste in the system, the Social Security Administration conducts \"continuing disability reviews,\" essentially investigating whether each recipient still has a disabling condition, and if so, which kind. Those reviews take place more or less frequently, depending on the nature of each individual's disability, broken into three \"medical diary categories,\" as follows: reviews In November, the Social Security Administration published its proposals to make several changes to the review system. The most significant proposal was to add a fourth medical diary category, \"Medical Improvement Likely.\" Recipients placed in that category would undergo a review every two years. proposals According to a document accompanying the proposals, the decision to introduce the fourth category was made, in part, because the administration saw a pattern whereby some in the \"Medical Improvement Expected\" category were being prematurely subjected to re-evaluation, after six-18 months, before a medical improvement had the chance to take hold, and some in the \"Medical Improvement Possible\" category had successfully treated their impairment comfortably within the three-year review interval. The introduction of the new category would therefore mean the bureaucratic burden on some recipients would actually be lessened, since they would be subject to review less frequently, though clearly it would also mean others would be subject to more frequent reviews. On the whole, the administration has estimated that, between 2020 and 2029, the new category would tend towards requiring more frequent reviews for those currently in the \"Medical Improvement Possible\" category, rather than less frequent reviews for those currently in the \"Medical Improvement Expected\" category:   The administration expects the introduction of the \"Medical Improvement Likely\" category to lead to an 18 percent increase in the total number of reviews undertaken over the next decade. This would therefore lead to an increased up-front cost in administering the disability benefits programs, and an increased aggregate bureaucratic burden to recipients (even if some individual recipients would actually undergo reviews less frequently).  Greater scrutiny of individual cases, and enhanced enforcement of eligibility criteria, results in some recipients no longer being deemed eligible, and no longer receiving either SSDI or SSI, which saves money for the Social Security insurance fund and the Treasury, respectively. For the 2015 fiscal year, for example, the Social Security Administration calculated a 19.9:1 return on investment rate for disability benefits enforcement  meaning that for every $1 spent on performing reviews, the government would save $19.90 on disability benefits that would otherwise have been paid, over the course of a lifetime, to recipients who are now deemed ineligible. To be specific, the administration estimated that the $717 million spent on reviews in 2015 would ultimately save $14.3 billion in lifetime disability benefit payments.  calculated So the introduction of the Trump administration's proposals is highly likely to ultimately lead to thousands of disability benefits recipients no longer receiving those benefits  both because some will be overburdened by the bureaucratic demands of more frequent reviews, and because some recipients whose medical status no longer meets the eligibility criteria will have that ineligibility discovered sooner. A considerable measure of truth, therefore, exists in the reports published by the Philadelphia Inquirer and Common Dreams. However, those articles failed to mention an important component to the administration's proposals: They would not change how a recipient's eligibility is determined, only how often that determination takes place. As the proposal stated: \"We are not changing the Medical Improvement Review Standard that we use to determine whether a person continues to meet the disability requirements of the Act.\" This means that, while the proposed increase in the number and frequency of reviews was highly likely to ultimately cause thousands to lose their benefits, that loss of benefits would not be arbitrary, or based on an application of a new and different standard for determining whether someone's health has improved. The standards and criteria for assessing whether an improvement has taken place would be the same as currently exist, and only the frequency of those reviews would change. In other words, some recipients would be subject to more frequent reviews, but if those more frequent reviews result in a finding that the recipient still has a qualifying disability or impairment  based on the same criteria as currently apply  the recipient would continue to receive disability benefits.  It could be that, as some critics have argued, the proposal represents an elegant way for the administration to save money by removing thousands from the recipient rolls without having to change eligibility criteria  the latter a move that would be more likely to cause public outrage or political opposition. However, on its face at least, the proposal involves enhanced enforcement of existing eligibility standards and criteria. That's an important distinction, and a significant omission from news articles that reported, with some justification, that the Trump administration had proposed changes to Social Security disability benefits that would cause thousands to be stripped of those benefits.  argued Lubrano, Alfred. \"Trump Administration Proposes Social Security Rule Changes That Could Cut Off Thousands of Disabled Recipients.\"\r\n The Philadelphia Inquirer/The Chicago Tribune. 12 December 2019.

Planned Parenthood hot potato Jeb Bush On 4 August 2015, Jeb Bush expressed doubt about the necessity of funding women's reproductive health services, a comment he later attempted to walk back. Among the reactions to Bush's statement were a number of claims made on social media sites that Prescott Bush (father of former president George H.W. Bush and grandfather of both former president George W. Bush and former governor Jeb Bush) was a founder or founding member of Planned Parenthood, the organization currently in the line of political fire. expressed walk back The \"smoking gun\" for that rumor was a 1947 letter sent by Planned Parenthood honorary chairman Margaret Sanger which listed Prescott as the treasurer of that organization in the letterhead. (A larger copy of the letter in question can be viewed here [PDF].) letter [PDF] Little is known of the specifics of Prescott Bush's level of involvement with Planned Parenthood back then, although modern accounts have maintained that the elder Bush sustained significant political damage due to what was described as an inaccurate smear on the eve of an election: accounts maintained In 1950, Bush was running even with William Benton, the Democratic nominee. But on the Sunday before the election, the muckraking columnist Drew Pearson asserted on his radio show that Prescott was treasurer of the Birth Control League. In the days before Griswold v. Connecticut, birth control remained illegal in the majority-Catholic state. While the family has long decried this as a smear, it was in fact a minor distortion  carefully orchestrated for maximum harm. Prescott was listed as treasurer on a letterhead for Planned Parenthood, a successor organization to the Birth Control League, which had closed up shop in 1942. Though he denied the charge, Prescott lost by 1,102 votes.   Prescott Bush's 1950 loss was similarly invoked for contrast (with the positions of George H.W. Bush) in a 1991 article published in the Baltimore Sun, titled \"What's behind Bush's flip-flop on family planning?\": The year was 1950, and the future president's father, Prescott Bush, was in a neck-and-neck U.S. Senate race in Connecticut. As the campaign entered its final days, disaster struck: Press reports disclosed that the senior Bush was a supporter of Planned Parenthood, causing an uproar among conservative voters. Prescott Bush lost the election by barely one-tenth of a percent of the vote. By all accounts, the birth-control issue cost him the election. Only one person has widely been credited as the founder of Planned Parenthood: Margaret Sanger. Prescott Bush was listed as treasurer on a 1947 letter sent by an early incarnation of Planned Parenthood, an affiliation that likely cost him  election to the U.S. Senate in 1950. But we haven't yet found any records suggesting a link between Prescott Bush and Planned Parenthood subsequent to that 1947 letter, so the evidence documenting his historical connection to the organization appears for now to consist of a single 1947 letter on which he was listed as treasurer. founder Margaret Sanger In any case, a number of political shifts have occurred in the nearly 70 years that have passed between that letter and his grandson Jeb Bush's August 2015 comments, so the elder Bush's purported involvement with Planned Parenthood could not reasonably be construed as a precedent for any position his grandson might take 68 years later. Moreover, more than 25 years passed between Prescott Bush's name appeared on the letterhead in 1947 and the Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade decision holding that the right to privacy under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion. Planned Parenthood's earliest incarnations focused primarily on the rudimentary birth control technologies (mainly diaphragms and condoms) made available to \"needy married women\"); abortion was not one of the services offered by that organization in 1947. landmark needy married women Last updated: 6 August 2015 Originally published: 6 August 2015",

Prepare to be amazed as I was!  God will even send us Teddy Bears ... Is this awesome or what.  \n\n   Origins:   Sometimes,  with a little help from our imaginations, we can see some surprisingly recognizable outlines of familiar objects in the clouds.  And on rare occasions, cloud patterns can form some remarkably realistic images that require little or no imagination on the part of the viewer to discern.  The strikingly detailed appearance of a teddy bear in the clouds shown above seems just a bit too good to true, however. And so it is. A couple of factors should cast doubts on this image's being a genuine photograph of a natural phenomenon: the unusual aspect (width to height) ratio of the image, and the fact that it's not merely a picture of unusual clouds, but a picture of someone else taking a photograph of unusual clouds.  In fact, the image is a still frame taken from the 2001 French film Le Fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain (distributed in the U.S. as Amlie), synopsized as follows: Amlie \n\nAmelie is a young Paris waitress who discovers an old box of childhood treasures hidden beneath her apartment floorboards, anonymously returns it to its rightful owner and watches from a distance as his life is transformed by the discovery. Thus begins her odyssey: a series of inventive plans to straighten out other people's lives. Almost as if by magic, Amelie begins to transform the lives of her ordinary neighbors  mostly for the better if they've earned it and occasionally for the worse if they deserve it  but she always hides behind a veil of mystery and anonymity. This works for her until she meets an intriguing young man named Nino. Now the question is: will she have the courage to do for herself what she has done for others?\n\n In the opening minutes of the film, young Amlie's pet goldfish, Blubber, causes Amlie's mother great consternation by continually jumping out of his bowl.  After one last recurrence lands Blubber under the refrigerator, requiring Amlie's father to jack the appliance up off the floor to rescue him, Amlie's mother decides enough is enough and sets Blubber free in a nearby stream.  To comfort little Amlie over the loss of her goldfish, Amlie's mother gives her a used Instamatic camera:  Right away (at the 7:20 mark on the DVD version of the film), Amlie snaps photographs of two remarkable cloud patterns: one forming an image of a rabbit, and then (in the opposite direction) another forming an image of a teddy bear: \n\n   \n  No miracles in the sky here, just the magic of movie-making.

The text of the meme read, \"Concerned about the loss of bees, Morgan Freeman converted his 124-acre Mississippi ranch into a bee refuge. He hired gardeners, filled acres with clover, planted hundreds of flowering trees, purchased 26 hives, and has turned himself into a beekeeper.\" Posts and articles on various websites stating the \"Shawshank Redemption\" star is a beekeeper with a bee sanctuary at his Mississippi residence have been circulating for years. They are sourced from an interview given by Freeman to late-night comedy host Jimmy Fallon in 2014. During the interview, Freeman acknowledged that he lived in Mississippi and stated he was new to beekeeping, having just purchased his bees from Arkadelphia, Arkansas, two weeks prior: interview  The website Mother Nature News in 2014 quoted Freeman talking about his beekeeping project, reporting that he made the following remarks during a media tour promoting the film \"Lucy\": quoted There's a concerted effort to bring bees back onto the planet ... We do not realize that they are the foundation, I think, of the growth of the planet, the vegetation... I have so many flowering things and I have a gardener too. Because she takes care of the bees too, all she does is figure out, 'OK, what would they like to have?', so we've got acres and acres of clover, we're planting stuff like lavender, I've got like, maybe 140 magnolia trees, big blossoms. In these comments attributed to him, Freeman mentioned environmental concerns associated with the survival of bees and making efforts to ensure his bees thrive. But he didn't actually state in those remarks that he converted his ranch into a \"bee sanctuary\" for the purpose of helping the environment. Over the years, news articles have cropped up sourcing Freeman's 2014 comments and reporting that he had converted his ranch in Mississippi to a bee sanctuary. In 2019, a large number of articles were aggregated from a Forbes story with the headline, \"Morgan Freeman Converted His 124-Acre Ranch Into A Giant Honeybee Sanctuary To Save The Bees.\" But the Forbes story also cites Freeman's 2014 interview on Fallon. news articles cropped up Forbes story We were unable to find recent comments by Freeman confirming whether he currently keeps bees at his Mississippi residence, as of this writing. We reached out to Freeman's agency CAA and asked whether Freeman is still beekeeping and whether his effort would be described as a bee sanctuary meant to help the environment, but didn't get a response in time for publication.

In 2011, the gravity measurement technique pioneered by GRACE, which works by measuring changes in the push and pull between the twin spacecraft as they orbit Earth, was put to use on NASA's twin GRAIL spacecraft embarking on an ambitious mission to study the gravitational forces of Earth's moon. In more than 15 years of operations, the GRACE satellite mission revolutionized our view of how water moves and is stored on Earth. GRACE measured changes in the local pull of gravity as water shifts around Earth due to changing seasons, weather and climate processes. Among its innovations, GRACE has monitored the loss of ice mass from Earth's ice sheets, improved understanding of the processes responsible for sea level rise and ocean circulation, provided insights into where global groundwater resources may be shrinking or growing and where dry soils are contributing to drought, and monitored changes in the solid Earth.

            "Rumor: Country singer Tim McGraw is playing a concert to benefit an 'anti-gun' group."
        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  Country singer Tim McGraw is playing a concert to benefit an 'anti-gun' group. MIXTURE Example:  [Collected via internet, April 2015] \n\n\n   Origins:  On 13 April 2015, country singer Tim McGraw announced that he would be headlining a benefit concert for the group Sandy Hook Promise (SHP), an organization dedicated to the cause of \"protecting children from gun violence\": Sandy Hook Promise \nTim McGraw has announced that on July 17, 2015 at XFINITY Theatre in Hartford, Connecticut, he will headline a Concert for Sandy Hook Promise. One-hundred percent of the net proceeds of this special event will benefit Sandy Hook Promise, an organization founded in the wake of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, with a mission of protecting children from gun violence. \"Out of this tragedy a group was formed that made a promise to honor the lives lost and turn it into a moment of transformation,\" said McGraw. \"Sandy Hook Promise teaches that we can do something to protect our children from gun violence. I want to be a part of that promise as a father and as a friend.\" This cause is close to Tim\u0019s heart, as it is to the fiddle player in his touring band, Dean Brown, a longtime friend to Mark Barden, a musician and father of a child, who was killed in the 2012 tragedy. \"I look forward to being a part of a night of hope and promise and music that will help continue the great work that Sandy Hook Promise is doing,\" said Brown. \"We are humbled that Tim would do this for us,\" said Barden. \"Dean and his wife Cindy helped my wife and I through our darkest hour and helped buoy our spirits. It meant more than words could ever say.\"\n Shortly after the press release was posted to McGraw's web site, some firearms-related blogs criticized the country singer for supporting an \"anti-gun\" group. Shotgun News, for instance, posted an article asking country music fans to delete McGraw from their playlists in light of the news: web site article \nYou may have thought country music stars were uniformly pro-gun, but apparently you were mistaken. Tim McGraw, notable both in his own right and as husband of country queen Faith Hill, is doing a concert July 17 to benefit Sandy Hook Promise, a group formed by veteran anti-gunners after the Connecticut school massacre.  Now it could be that McGraw has made the same mistake Jay Leno made, and taken on a gig without investigating the political implications. If that's the case, then some noise from our side may warn him off. If he\u0019s doing it because he agrees with SHP, country fans reading this may want to edit their playlists.\n While it's true that Tim McGraw has agreed to perform at a concert for Sandy Hook Promise, classifying that group as \"anti-gun\" may not be completely accurate. The organization's mission statement references protecting children from gun violence by supporting mental health and gun safety programs, not by advocating a ban on firearms in general (or any particular class of firearms):  mission statement \nOur Mission 1) Protect children from gun violence so no other parent experiences the loss of their child by engaging and empowering parents and communities with targeted prevention programs in the areas of mental wellness early-identification & intervention, social & emotional development and firearm safety & security. 2) Help our community through this tragedy by providing resources and programs that foster connection, resiliency and overall wellness.\n Sandy Hook Promise does, however, support the consideration of what they deem to be \"new laws where public safety and reduction in violence can be achieved without eroding 2nd Amendment rights,\" such as legislation that would require background checks for all gun sales, reduce the maximum capacity of ammunition magazines to ten bullets, and make firearms trafficking and straw purchases federal crimes: legislation \nWe support the 2nd Amendment. We recognize an individual's right to bear arms and support millions of law-abiding citizens in the United States who own firearms. We believe with rights come responsibilities that we all bear to ensure the safety of individuals, communities and our nation. Current laws need to be enforced and need to have loopholes closed. Where applicable, new laws should be considered where public safety and reduction in violence can be achieved without eroding 2nd Amendment rights. Below are current gun safety and responsibility policy changes SHP supports: Background check should be required for every gun sale\nEvery individual, regardless of where or from whom they purchase a firearm, should undergo a background check to ensure that the purchaser is not a risk for perpetrating gun violence. The background check requirement for private sales should be enforceable, and States should ensure that the data they provide for the system is complete and up to date. 90% of Americans stated they support background checks; we believe Congress and state legislators should too. Reduce capacity of ammunition magazines to 10 bullets or lower\nWithin four minutes, the shooter at Sandy Hook Elementary fired 154 bullets, killing 20 first grade children and six educators  our loved ones. The killer used magazines with a capacity of 30 bullets. We now know that he left less lethal, lower-capacity magazines at home. Reducing magazines to a capacity of 10 bullets or less can save innocent lives. Many of the children who escaped from one of the classrooms at Sandy Hook Elementary reportedly did so when the shooter stopped to reload. We are left to wonder how many victims  maybe our children  also might have escaped if the killer had to reload more frequently. Firearms trafficking and straw purchases should be federal crimes\nCongress should support law enforcement's efforts to get guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals by making it a crime to buy a gun for another person and by stiffening penalties for those purchasing a gun to give to a person who is prohibited by law from having a gun. The cost of continuing our willful ignorance of these evasions of our gun laws is simply too high.\n \n\n\n\n  Last updated:  15 April 2015\n",

        "justification": "A set of gruesome photographs supposedly showing the aftermath of a \"pico jackfruit snake\" bite is frequently shared online. We'll be posting these photographs below. As they show a severe hand injury, this article may not suitable for all viewers. The photographs first went viral in August 2017 after they were posted to the Facebook group Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in New York. The first photograph in the set shows what appears to be a small cut on a person's thumb. Subsequent photographs show the injury worsening, due to the snake's venomous bite, until eventually the thumb is amputated. Again, the following photographs may not be suitable for all viewers:   We haven't been able to uncover too many specifics about these photographs, such as where they were taken or the identity of the snake-bit victim. When these images first started circulating on Facebook in 2017 (the original post has since been deleted), the snake was identified as a \"sharp-nosed viper,\" not a \"pico jackfruit snake.\"  In fact, we found no snake by the latter's name. It likely refers to a bushmaster snake, another genus of venomous pit-vipers, which is known by a variety of names across South America, such as the pineapple snake, the silent rattlesnake, and the stinging jackfruit.  Regardless of the specific species of snake, these photographs appear to provide a genuine look at the painful aftermath of a venomous snakebite. News.com.au talked to Brian Fry, an associate professor in the school of biological sciences at the University of Queensland, when these images first went viral:  News.com.au That type of snake [Sharp-nosed viper] has a venom that is extremely tissue destroying, Dr Fry told news.com.au. The reason for this is that they kill their prey by haemorrhagic shock, where some parts of the venom damage the blood vessel walls, while other parts destroy the ability of the blood to clot, leading to a state of massive internal bleeding in a prey animal. As Associate Professor in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Queensland, Dr Fry said because it is a Chinese snake; antivenom for a bite like this might be hard to come by in remote areas. If it was in a private collection somewhere, they probably didnt have it and likely none of the nearby zoos would either, he explained. Thus, theyd have to suffer through the full effects. While we haven't been able to find much information about this specific set of photographs, we have found other snake-bite cases that resulted in similar injuries. A 2015 article from the BBC explained some of the science behind deadly venomous snake bites: cases resulted similar injuries BBC Snake venom is made up of several hundred proteins which all have a slightly different toxic effect on the human body. One snake's poison may not be like another's, even if they are from the same species. But, on the whole, there are two main ways snakes make us suffer  by attacking the circulatory system (ie. the blood) and/or the nervous system. Haemotoxic venom goes for the bloodstream. It can trigger lots of tiny blood clots and then when the venom punches holes in blood vessels causing them to leak, there is nothing left to stem the flow and the patient bleeds to death. Other venoms can increase blood pressure, decrease blood pressure, prevent bleeding or create it. They are all bad news. Neurotoxic venom tends to act more quickly, attacking the nervous system and stopping nerve signals getting through to the muscles. This means paralysis, starting at the head, moving down the body until, if untreated, the diaphragm is paralysed and the patient can't breathe. A classic sign of this is ptosis, when people can't keep their eyes open. Around the area of the bite, necrosis can set in. That happens when the venom destroys nearby muscles, tissues and cells. Long-term, this can lead to amputations, the loss of the use of a limb or the need for multiple skin grafts. In sum, the above photographs most likely show the gruesome aftermath of a snake bite, but because we were unable to uncover specific details about the pictures, we've rated this claim \"Unproven.\" Brown, Vanessa.  \"Horror Snake Bite Causes Victims Thumb to Turn Black Before Being Amputated\"\r\n  News.com.au.  15 August 2017.

        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  Sorority house plumbing was destroyed by the stomach acids of bulimic students. LEGEND Examples:  \n[Collected on the Internet, June 1992] A sorority house had to have all of its plumming and pipes replaced because they were leaking all over the place. Thing is, the house wasn't that old. The reason: the sorority girls barfed so much in an effort to control their weight that the acids had eroded the plumming.\n \n [Collected via e-mail, July 2007] A friend of mine mentioned today that pipes at some ballet academies in New York must be changed frequently because of such high frequencies of bullimia and other eating disorders.\n Origins:  This bit of lore about sorority house plumbing destroyed by the binging and purging of bulimic students has been kicking about for several decades: the oldest print references to it we've so far encountered date ito 1987, and it is likely even older than that. According to this well-traveled tale, the plumbing in various women's housing is under constant assault from the stomach acids of gals looking to lose weight by means of throwing up whatever food they've eaten. Though usually told of sorority houses (which are assumed, for the purposes of this cautionary tale, to be filled with young women obsessed with staying as thin as  possible), the legend has also been applied to other buildings where one could reasonably expect to encounter a large number of women, such as dance academies (as in the second example given above). Bulimia nervosa, better known as bulimia, is a serious eating disorder. Generally, those who engage in it overeat (\"binge\"), then seek to rid themselves of the ingested calories by \"purging.\" (Purging, by the way, does not necessarily mean vomiting. It can include any type of attempt to rid the body of that which was dined upon before those foodstuffs are digested, such as overuse of laxatives, enemas, diuretics, severely restrictive dieting, excessive exercising, etc.) The tale of the destroyed plumbing has been passed along by many over the years. A 1987 news article about a play called \"Foodfright\" (presented by the Summer Dance Workshop at the University of South Florida in Tampa) said, \"So many young dance students at a prestigious school in New York City suffered from bulimia  a disease in which a person forces him or herself to vomit so as to get rid of unwanted calories  that the bathroom plumbing wore out.\" Said Caroline Adams Miller, author My Name Is Caroline (1988) and Feeding the Soul (2002), said in a 1993 interview: \"Some college sororities are notorious for bulimia and anorexia. I've heard that some houses have plumbing problems because of all the vomiting going on.\" A 2000 news article stated: \"One local therapist was recently called in to do a seminar for a dorm at a private DC university because the plumbing in one of its toilets had rotted. The same acid from vomit that gives bulimics tooth decay had eaten through the pipes.\" In 2004 then-Miss California Veena Goel regaled a middle school audience with her account of how the plumbing in her college sorority house had to be replaced because stomach acid from all the girls with eating disorders had eaten through the metal pipes. As to whether any actual plumbing systems have been destroyed by the digestive juices of bulimic girls, we can't say. The legend is perhaps better viewed as warning to those who might be tempted to try this very damaging method of weight loss, something intended to get them to think about what regurgitated stomach acids might do to their throats and teeth.

        "justification": "A video purportedly showing Chelsea, Bill, and Hillary Clinton prematurely celebrating a presidential election victory was widely shared on the internet in the wake of the Democratic nominee's loss on 8 November 2016: While this video was distributed by several web sites along with the assertion that it showed the Clintons prematurely celebrating a victory on election night that proved to be unrealized, little evidence was provided to back up this claim. The video contains no audio, is only a few seconds long, and as of this writing the sourceis still unknown. The earliest version we could uncover was published by LiveLeak on 16 November 2016, but that video was also lacking context. The Gateway Pundit attempted to prove to their readers (or possibly to mislead them into believing) that the video was takenon election night by providing a photograph ofBill, Chelsea, and Hillary Clinton in similar clothing at an 8 November 2016 campaign event: Although that photograph was taken on Election Day 2016, there were some obvious differences between the clothes the Clintons were wearing in that image and the ones they are seen wearing in the video. Mainly, Chelsea Clinton was garbed a sort of aqua sleeveless dress in the still photograph, but she sports a dark blue long-sleeved dress in the video:  photograph  Perhaps more telling is the change in Bill Clinton's attire. Photographs from Election Day 2016 show that Bill Clinton was wearing a light blue shirt with a dark blue and white tie, but in the video he is seen clothed in a white shirt with a salmon-colored tie:  In addition to the optical discrepancies, the narrative behind the claim doesn't quite add up. Clinton was likely confident heading into the election since most polls showed her with a large advantage, so it's hard to fathom a moment which would have elicited such an act of jubilation in the course of an election night in which she lost. So when was this video taken? Bill, Hillaryand Chelsea Clinton were wearing outfits that match those shown in the video at the first presidential debate of 2016 at Hofsfra University:   Embed from Getty Images   It's plausible that the Clintons would have engaged a short but jubilant celebration after this event, as many observed felt that Clinton had won the debate. won The \"premature celebration\" video is frequently shared in close proximity to a similar claim holding that Clinton threw a tantrum following her election night loss.

As of this writing, medical institutions  ranging from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine  were aggressively attempting to combat false messages like Minaj's regarding infertility and vaccinations' alleged impact on reproductive systems, a process on which we elaborate below. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) American Society for Reproductive Medicine For people with female reproductive organs, the false theory stems from inoculations' real impact on recipients' immune systems. Vaccines produced by Moderna and Pfizer, for examples, use mRNA technology to train people's immune systems into producing antibodies that can fight the virus that causes COVID-19, technically called SARS-CoV-2. mRNA technology fight the virus \"mRNA vaccines teach our cells how to make a protein  or even just a piece of a protein  that triggers an immune response inside our bodies,\" the CDC states. That said, some people erroneously believe that those vaccine-producedantibodies could somehow mistake the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein withsyncytin-1  a different type of cellular formation that helps develop placentas and is vital for successful pregnancies. They operate under the false argument that the two proteins (SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and placenta protein) appear similar and, therefore, the inoculation's technology could easily confuse the two. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein However, as biochemistEdward Nirenberg explained in a December 2020 blog post, the formulas of molecules (called amino acids) that make the two proteins have very few similarities. For one, the SARS-CoV-2 strand is shorter than the placenta protein: The former has 1,273 amino acids, while the latter has has 538, as reported by India's National Magazine Frontline. Edward Nirenberg December 2020 ndia's National Magazine Frontline \"There is no plausible reason  no medical or scientific mechanism  for this vaccine to interact with a woman's reproductive organs or have any interaction with an egg that's been released or fertilized,\" family medicine doctor Laura Morris said in a news bulletin by University of Missouri Health Care (MU Health Care).\"For your immune system to get mixed up and attack the placental protein would be like you mistaking an elephant for an alley cat because they're both gray. news bulletin \"There is one small similarity, but the overall construction of the protein is so completely different, your immune system is way too smart to be confused by that.\" Considering those biological facts, no reputable research has found COVID-19 vaccines complicate pregnancies or make it harder for women to conceive when studying the inoculations' impact on recipients' bodies. The CDC stated on its website, as of this writing: women to conceive   In other words, during clinical trials, unintended pregnancies occurred at similar rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, as Victoria Male, a researcher of reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, summarized in the British Medical Journal.And, atassisted reproduction clinics, fertility measures and pregnancy rates were also similar between the two groups. Victoria Male the British Medical Journal. Meanwhile, it was true that tens of thousands of people reported changes to their period cycle or unexpected bleeding after receiving COVID-19 vaccinations as reported by reputable news outlets, including the BBC. reported by reputable news outlets, including the BBC However, there was no evidence to link those menstrual changes to the vaccine recipients' fertility. Rather, the possible side effect appeared to be physical proof of how people's immune systems were responding to the vaccines  much like how some people have experienced a fever, chills, or headache after the shots. appeared to be Additionally, as Male wrote in the British Medical Journal, most people who reported the possible side effect said it was temporary and their cycles returned to normal the following month: wrote in the British Medical Journal, Menstrual changes have been reported after both mRNA [Pfizer and Moderna] and adenovirus vectored covid-19 vaccines [Johnson & Johnson],1 suggesting that, if there is a connection, it is likely to be a result of the immune response to vaccination rather than a specific vaccine component. Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) has also been associated with menstrual changes.9 Indeed, the menstrual cycle can be affected by immune activation in response to various stimuli, including viral infection: in one study of menstruating women, around a quarter of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 experienced menstrual disruption. 1 9 Maleand the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) were calling for more research into the potential connection between menstrual changes and the vaccinations. Male National Institute of Child Health and Human Development While the possible side effect was largely \"short-lived\" and unrelated to fertility, Male wrote, understanding its full scope could help alleviate concerns among young women who falsely believe that the vaccinations could hurt their chances of future pregnancy. \"Failing to thoroughly investigate reports of menstrual changes after vaccination is likely to fuel these fears,\" Male stated. All of this said, experts in reproductive health recommend vaccinations for everyone who's thinking about becoming pregnant, already with child, or breastfeeding just like the rest of the population (over the age of 12). For example, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) said in a joint statement: statement As experts in reproductive health, we continue to recommend that the vaccine be available to pregnant individuals. We also assure patients that there is no evidence that the vaccine can lead to loss of fertility. While fertility was not specifically studied in the clinical trials of the vaccine, no loss of fertility has been reported among trial participants or among the millions who have received the vaccines since their authorization, and no signs of infertility appeared in animal studies. Loss of fertility is scientifically unlikely. Furthermore, medical experts saypeople who know they're pregnant should get the shots as soon as possible. That populationfaces a higher risk of hospitalization or death due to COVID-19 compared to everyone else. (See the CDC's full list of underlying medical conditions that could exacerbate a COVID-19 viral infectionhere.) people who know they're pregnant faces a higher risk here \"We have no logical reason to believe that the vaccine impacts fertility in any way, but we have plenty of evidence that pregnant individuals who become sick with COVID-19 get sicker, on average, than non-pregnant individuals,\" Cecilia Stuopis, the medical director of theMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Medical, said in an update. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Medical Also, asidefrom COVID-19's attack on pregnant people's respiratory system, evidence suggests the virusmay be linked to potentially life-threatening pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, according to theMIT Medicalupdate. AndMayo Clinic highlighted research that indicated pregnant women with COVID-19 were more likely to have premature births, cesarean deliveries, or babies that need neonatal care. preeclampsia MIT Medical Mayo Clinic \"If you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant, contracting COVID-19 is almost certainly more dangerous than getting vaccinated,\" Stuopis said. Now, let's pivot to sperm. As of this writing, reputable medical institutions, including the CDC, were refuting rumors about male infertility by pointing to a study at the University of Miami in which researchers recruited 45 healthy men between the ages of 18 and 50 with no underlying reproductive issues. The researchers examined the characteristics of their sperm, including the amount of them and how they moved, before and after the men got Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. study at the University of Miami In conclusion, the study stated: \"No man became azoospermic after the vaccine,\" or unable to produce sperm. azoospermic Meanwhile, Ranjith Ramasamy, the director of male reproductive medicine and surgery at the university, highlighted evidence that suggests the virus  not its vaccinations  can affect sperm counts and cause impotency. He worked on a study, for example, that examined penile tissue samples from two men who had COVID-19, and found blood vessel damage that would make it hard for blood to enter the penis for an erection. Ranjith Ramasamy highlighted study \"Interestingly, the male reproductive organs have been found to be vulnerable in moderate to severe illness, leading to reports of erectile dysfunction and orchitis,\" a condition that can result in swollen testicles, according to a summary byRamasamy and other researchers. condition Additionally, \"the risk of infertility and erectile dysfunction increases with the severity of an infection,\" Daniel Nassau, a urologist at the university, told Frontline. Frontline The impact of COVID-19 infections aside, there was no scientific support for Minaj's claim that the vaccines  the technology that aims to combat the virus  caused impotency or orchitis among people with male reproductive systems.\"We've never seen that,\" Ramasamy toldThe Associated Press. The Associated Press Ashley Winter, a urologist specializing in sexual dysfunction at Kaiser Permanente in Portland, Oregon, also emphasized in an interview with thatnews outletthat there was no evidence to substantiate any concerns over the vaccinations' potential threat to male fertility. thatnews outlet \"On a population level, hundreds of millions of men have gotten this vaccine, and there's no study showing reduced erectile function in men who have been vaccinated,\" she said. \"Fundamentally, we just have no study linking the vaccine to either swollen testicles or erectile dysfunction.\" CDC. \"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 11 Feb. 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/underlying-evidence-table.html. \"CDC Newsroom.\" CDC, 1 Jan. 2016, https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0811-vaccine-safe-pregnant.html.

            "A discussion of the droit du seigneur, or the 'right of the lord.'"
        ],
        "justification": "Legend:  Under a law known as the droit du seigneur (\"right of the lord\"),  medieval noblemen had the right to spend the first night with newly-wedded brides in their fiefdoms. Origins:  The use of political power (or any exalted position in society) as a means of gaining entry into women's beds has been with us for thousands of years.  The name of this phenomenon has changed over the years (from ius primae noctus to droit de seigneur to \"the master's obligation\" to sexual harrassment), but the concept has   remained the same. The custom of someone other than the husband being the first to engage in sexual intercourse with a bride after the wedding (and thus being the one to relieve her of her virginity) goes back several thousand years and is tied to the concept of God as the source of all life. If all life springs from the creator, then surely his earthly representatives or human incarnations are guarantors of fertility and abundant harvests.  Thus, for a bride to spend the first night of her married life with (and give up her viriginity to) a priest, the creator's supreme authority on Earth, was seen as a way of ensuring the newly-wedded couple's fertility and guaranteeing their union would produce many children.  (Priests were also considered to have the duty of protecting grooms from danger of the blood of defloration.) After the Sumerians developed the concept of a divinely-ordained king \"descended from heaven\" as the primary intermediary between man and his creator, kings supplanted priests as the vessels of fertility, and the physical well-being and reproductive power of kings became symbolic of the overall strength and viability of their kingdoms.  In the Bible, for example, 1 Kings uses David's loss of sexual vigor as metaphor in chronicling the attempted usurpation of his throne by those who recognize his advanced age makes him too weak to rule effectively: \n\nNow king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.\n In other words, David's impotence demonstrated that his kingdom was weak, and the inability of a young virgin to arouse him was a sign that his throne was ripe for the taking.  David's son Adonijah, aware of his father's loss of potency, began plotting a usurpation, but Bathsheba convinced an ailing David that he had already promised the crown to  Solomon. The first recorded instance of the \"first night\" custom appears in the Epic of Gilgamesh, a five-cycle tale based on a historical king of Uruk in Babylonia around 2700 B.C.E.  In Tablet 2, Gilgamesh, as the king, claims the right to have sexual intercourse first with every new bride in Uruk on the day of her wedding; Enkidu, the subhuman brute, enters the city, protests this \"abuse,\" and blocks the door of a marital chamber until Gilgamesh bests him in a fight.  Enkidu's challenge might be taken as an indication that the custom was already an unpopular one by the time the Epic of Gilgamesh was set down in writing. The right of first night deflowering (ius primae noctis in Latin) was also practiced by despotic Roman chieftains, who took the custom to a new level by charging husbands for their performance of this duty; prospective husbands who couldn't afford to pay the fee could not marry. (The imposition of a fee was a ruse created to foster the illusion that the purpose of this \"service\" was to ensure fertility rather than to satisfy the carnal cravings of chieftains.)  As population sizes outstripped the abilities of royalty to attend to all new brides, the use of symbolic substitutes (such as the phalluses of fertility statues) began: \n\nPrior to consummating marriage with her husband, a bride ceremoniously straddled a stone statue of the fertility god, lowering herself onto his effigy. This was not a private ritual but part of the public wedding ceremony, so that all the guests could witness the bloodied evidence of virginity, as well as the girl's avowal to be fruitful.2\n First night customs survived in parts of Europe into the Middle Ages (as the droit du seigneur), although by then it had been stripped of any pretense that it was a means of assuring fruitful harvests and fecund brides.  Feudal noblemen were not of royal blood and had no claim to divinity; they were \"lords\" only by virtue of having been granted titles, and they simply used their positions of power over their vassals as a basis for asserting their \"right\" to substitute for any of them on the wedding night. Though nobleman still referred to the droit de seigneur as a \"duty,\" they also reserved the right to waive their performance of it (presumably when they found a bride to be considerably less than attractive in physical appearance). Slaveholders, of course, held their slaves as property and could therefore force themselves upon female slaves with impunity.  Slavery was legal in America until 1865, and there was no tradition or ritual (and certainly no sense of \"duty\") attached to this form of rape euphemistically known as \"the master's obligation.\"  It was more realistically \"the master's prerogative,\" and it was not exercised concurrent with weddings, but at a master's whim. Of all the historical forms of \"first night\" practices, the droit du seigneur is the most familiar in popular culture, and it is often cited as not just a widely-practiced custom, but as a codified part of medieval law.  Both the prevalance of the practice and its legal status in medieval Europe are highly questionable, however.  The Encylopedia Britannica, for example, notes: \n\n[The droit du seigneur] is paralleled in various primitive societies, but the evidence of its existence in Europe is almost all indirect, involving records of the redemption dues paid by the vassal to avoid enforcement, not of actual enforcement.  Many intellectual investigations have been devoted to the problem, but, although it seems possible that such a custom may have existed for a short time at a very early date in parts of France and Italy, it certainly never existed elsewhere.1\n\n The historical record shows far more resistance to the droit du seigneur than evidence of its occurrence, which might indicate that it was primarily a concept employed as a means of extorting money from vassals rather than an actual practice.  Alain Boureau argues that the droit du seigneur was largely a myth perpetuated for political reasons (e.g., monarchists in the late Middle Ages cited the droit du seigneur to rally public opinion against local lords; partisans of the French Revolution used it as proof of the corruption and depravity of the Ancien Rgime).  Wendy Doniger writes that we might regard the droit du seigneur \"in which the king controls the sexuality of his female subjects, as merely the extreme political form of the much more common practice of arranged marriages, in which the father controls the sexuality of his daughter,\" a myth which dramatizes \"the tension between duty, in which women had little choice, and desire, in which they had some choice.\"  In conclusion, she notes that although the specifics of the \"first night\" myths may be exaggerated or false, the broader concept  the historical use political power used for sexual purposes  still holds true: \n\n[S]urely the use of political power to secure sexual favors is ancient and widespread. The droit du seigneur in the broadest sense  political pressure for sexual favors, what we now call sexual harrassment  must have been invoked informally all the time but was formalized in the myths as if it were a kind of unofficial law or right, one that was, from the start, intolerable. It may never, or seldom, have been technically legal, but it was not \"just a myth.\"3\n\n Last updated:  27 June 2005\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   1.

        "justification": "Claim:  Embedded ticks can cause paralysis. \nStatus:  True.\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, 2006] \n\n\nTo everyone who helped me and my family through our emergency last week by picking up or switching shifts, we thank you so very much!  Also thanks to all that kept Alyssa in your thoughts and prayers and called to check-up on how we were doing or see if there was anything that they could do to help, we appreciate it! Alyssa is 100% back to her old self and if you looked at her now you never would have known that she was ever sick.  For those of you with small children or one on the way, here's a synopsis of what happened to that you can watch out for it with your own children. On Tuesday morning she woke up paralyzed from her waist down, she wasn't able to walk or stand on her own.  I called the Eglin pediatrics nurses line and told them what was going on and they told me to wait 3 days and if her symptoms hadn't cleared to bring her in.  We took her to the ER on Eglin and after 12 hours there all her tests, blood, urine and CAT scan returned as normal. They told us that she had Ataxia, with no explanation as to what that is, and set us up for an appointment for the following day with pediatrics. If you Google Ataxia, you'll understand why we were so devastated.  The short version is that it is a disease with no cure, she would be wheel-chair bound the rest of her life and would never see her 20's. On Wednesday morning she woke up paralyzed from her neck down. She couldn't even sit without being propped up by pillows and blankets.  Her eyes were also fully dilated and she would stare off into nothing for long periods of time.  No amount of clapping or calling out her name would snap her back.  We went back to Eglin's ER and we were ambulanced to the children's hospital in Pensacola.  After 15 minutes in P-cola hospital a nurse who had seen these same symptoms in another little girl earlier that week found a tick on Lysa's head buried under all her hair.  The toxins in the tick's saliva were too much for her liver to metabolize and started paralyzing her starting at her feet and moving up. (Tick paralysis, Google brings up good information on that too).  Once the tick was removed she started getting better, 24 hours later she was running down the hospital hallways and we were released.  The docs said that had we waited another 12-24 hours her chest would have been paralyzed to the point of her not being able to breathe on her own.  The little girl that had been in earlier that week was already on a ventilator when they found the tick on her. So in this area, particularly during this season check you kids for ticks regularly.  Use insect repellant if you're going out into wooded areas and all that good stuff.  A good rule of thumb that one of the nurses in P-cola told me was, if your child is complaining of their feet hurting or going numb, and you can't find any sign of an injury, start looking for ticks. Again thank you to everyone for helping us through this, and I hope this information can help you keep your kids safe!\n Origins:  The letter quoted above began circulating on the Internet in June 2006. While we do not know the particulars of the incident it recounts and so can't confirm that it chronicles an actual event, what it describes is consonant with similar cases mentioned in medical literature: \n\n[CDC, 1996] On April 10, 1995, a 2-year-old girl who resided in Asotin County, Washington, was taken to the emergency department of a regional hospital because of a 2-day history of unsteady gait, difficulty standing, and reluctance to walk. Other than a recent history of cough, she had been healthy and had not been injured. On physical examination, she was afebrile, alert, and active but could stand only briefly before requiring assistance. Cranial nerve function was intact. However, she exhibited marked extremity and mild truncal ataxia, and deep tendon reflexes were absent. She was admitted with a tentative diagnosis of either Guillain-Barre syndrome or postinfectious polyradiculopathy.  Within several hours of hospitalization, she had onset of drooling and tachypnea. A nurse incidentally detected an engorged tick on the girl's hairline by an ear and removed the tick. Within 7 hours after tick removal, tachypnea subsided and reflexes were present but diminished. The patient recovered fully and was discharged on April 11. The tick species was not identified.\n \n [Kocan, 1988] A 7-year-old girl was taken to her physician for evaluation of acute, ascending motor paralysis and speech difficulties. The girl's parents indicated that she had no history of motor difficulties and that the current symptoms developed quite rapidly. The family lived in a rural area, and the child often played in the woods accompanied by her pet dog. Results of laboratory investigations were not remarkable. A single engorged female tick was found attached to the girl's neck, and it was determined that the child had tick paralysis. Speech and motor function improved rapidly after the tick was removed, and the child recovered within hours and without complications.\n Tick paralysis is caused by a neurotoxin produced in the tick's salivary gland. As the University of Pennsylvania Health System's web site describes it: web site \n\nHard- and soft-bodied female ticks are thought to produce a neurotoxin capable of causing paralysis in children. Ticks attach to the skin to feed on blood. It is during this feeding process that the toxin enters the bloodstream. The resulting paralysis is ascending (starting in the lower body and moving up) and is similar to that seen in Guillain-Barre syndrome and opposite that seen in botulism and paralytic shellfish poisoning (descending). Affected children develop an unsteady gait (ataxia) followed several days later by lower extremity weakness that gradually moves up to involve the upper limbs. Paralysis may cause loss of respiratory ability and the patient may require a ventilator. Symptoms:\n\nhistory of exposure to ticks such as camping, a tick-infested area, dogs or other animals\nfinding a tick attached at the back of the neck at the hairline\nunsteady jerky body movements and gait (ataxia)\nmuscle weakness beginning in the lower extremities and progressing upwards\nbreathing difficulties\n\n The word ataxia, by the way, serves both as the name of a specific disease (actually, a group of diseases known as hereditary and sporadic ataxias) and as a general term meaning \"the loss of ability to coordinate muscular movement\" (also known as dyssynergia or incoordination). The nurse in the story quoted above appears to have intended her use of the word as a description of some of the stricken child's symptoms, but the mother understood it as the name of her daughter's illness, hence her mention of \" ... disease with no cure, she would be wheel-chair bound the rest of her life and would never see her 20's.\"  More simply put, we note that: \n Tick paralysis is not ataxia.  Ataxia (incoordination) is one of the effects of tick paralysis (in the same way that vomiting is one of the effects of food poisoning).  Ataxia (disease: hereditary or sporadic) is unrelated to tick paralysis.\n Barbara \"dual-use words are a pistol\" Mikkelson  \n     National Ataxia Foundation\n\n   Last updated:  25 June 2006\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   Kocan, A.

The Price Is Right Drew Carey keto Us Weekly On May 9, 2022, we looked at a paid advertisement from the Blossom Words Facebook page that showed a picture of Carey with a sad expression on his face. The ad read, \"What you didn't know about the 'Price Is Right' host. Will the show stay on air?\" It appeared to hint that the long-running game show would be ending. However, this was nothing but misleading clickbait to try to sell a keto diet pill product named Lifestyle Keto. Facebook Carey Price Is Right  The ad appeared to vaguely hint that something was revealed about Carey that he was sad about. We previously saw this same clickbait tactic used with \"Jeopardy\" host Mayim Bialik. In that instance, an ad falsely claimed that there were \"allegations\" against Bialik. The ad led to a fake CBD gummies endorsement page that mentioned nothing of any \"allegations\" against the TV star, because there were none. Carey Jeopardy Mayim Bialik CBD After clicking the ad with Carey's sad facial expression, we were led to a scammy website (entertainmentnewsnow.net) that published a fake Us Weekly article. It appeared that scammers had copied the design from the official Us Weekly website and recreated it to push their scam, all seemingly without the authorization of the magazine's parent company, A360 Media, LLC. A360 Media, LLC  The article included a fake interview between Carey and Ellen DeGeneres in which he purportedly endorsed a product named Lifestyle Keto. The interview supposedly happened on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\" At one point during the fake interview, DeGeneres supposedly asked, \"Lifestyle Keto? You mean Lifestyle Ketosis? I think I saw something on Dr. Oz about it.\" We found no record of this interview or any mention of Lifestyle Keto on Dr. Mehmet Oz's show, because it was completely made up by the person or people who designed the website. Ellen DeGeneres Dr. Mehmet Oz The fake interview in the fake Us Weekly article had the following headline: \"After Drew Careys Shocking Health News- Millions Of Americans Are Melting Body Fat & Getting Ripped Thanks To His Intermittent Keto Routine!\" It began like this: The Price Is Right's Drew Carey has recently opened up about his recent body transformation after having battled with weight problems for most of his life. Drew was recently announced as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People, and is a loving father. Carey said that for his entire comedy career, he had tried everything. He tried a lot of classes, he tried his own healthy recipes, but nothing worked like Lifestyle Keto did. Like millions of parents across North America, the TV star seems to swear by Keto Prime, but he has said it was hard to find something that worked and he trusted - it took him years to find this keto solution. In 2022, Drew Carey told US Weekly Magazine that he had tried almost every fitness style, class, and supplement out there, but was yet to figure out what works for him. The Price Is Right \"I tried spinning, I tried running, I tried Pilates. I realized I don't like running ... I refuse to do it,\" Drew Carey told the publication. Eventually, he said he fell in love with Lifestyle Keto. This whole article was both misleading and false. Again, we found no record that Carey had ever endorsed Lifestyle Keto or any other keto diet pills. To cover all of the bases for any future claims, we also found no evidence that he endorsed any CBD gummies or oil products. We previously saw Us Weekly's website design being used in other keto diet pill scams, all seemingly without the publisher's authorization. In 2018, we debunked a claim to the effect that singer Kelly Clarkson had been fired from the reality TV series \"The Voice\" and that she later endorsed keto diet pills. debunked Kelly Clarkson In 2021, another fake article that mimicked the Us Weekly website design claimed that the cast of the \"Shark Tank\" reality TV series had endorsed a product named Keto Burn. All of this was false. claimed Shark Tank In 2010, People.com published an article about the real way that Carey said he lost 80 pounds. Keto diet pills didn't appear in the story: article So how'd he do it? No carbs, Carey says. I have cheated a couple times, but basically no carbs, not even a cracker. No bread at all. No pizza, nothing. No corn, no beans, no starches of any kind. Egg whites in the morning or like, Greek yogurt, cut some fruit. He snacks on fruit, and for dinner he ll have grilled chicken and steamed vegetables and water. I dont drink anything but water, he says. No coffee, no tea, no soda. In sum, no, \"The Price Is Right\" is not ending or going off the air, nor did Carey ever endorse Lifestyle Keto or any other keto diet pill products. All of this was false.

            "A Facebook meme purporting to prove that the Dow suffers under Republican presidencies ignores key data. "
        ],
        "justification": "After the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost a historic 1,175 points in a single day in February 2018, the left-wing Facebook page Occupy Democrats was keen to point out a trend. In a 6 February meme, the page listed what it called the \"Biggest One-Day Drops in Dow Jones History,\" along with the name of the U.S. president in office at the time of each point drop. meme According to the meme, each of the largest drops occurred during the presidencies of Donald Trump and George W. Bush -- both Republicans. The meme concluded: \"Share this for your friends who STILL think Republicans are GOOD for the economy!\"    The meme correctly lists the seven biggest one-day points drops in Dow Jones history, which all took place during the tenure of two Republican presidents, though it leaves out the eighth, ninth and 10th, which occurred with Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in the White House. The main problem with the meme, however, is that its conclusion (that the numbers show which president is good for the economy) overstates the influence of a president -- as opposed to macro-economic and geopolitical forces -- on stock market trends. In fact, one-day losses and gains can sometimes happen despite the policies and efforts of the person in the Oval Office. For example, many commentators attributed the 29 September 2008 points drop -- the second-biggest ever -- to the U.S. House of Representatives' failure to pass a $700 billion bank bailout bill, which President George W. Bush had pushed for.  many commentators attributed Even if one simply wanted to examine during which presidencies the Dow suffered largest single-day losses, looking at the largest point drops wouldn't be the way to do it. As the stock market has grown in value over the last century, large point drops have become more common, even if their impact on the overall market value isn't particularly great. To get a clearer picture of the impact of these drops, one would have to measure the drop in percentage terms, rather than points.  Biggest one-day percentage losses (Sources: Wall Street Journal's Market Data and Yahoo! Finance's downloadable Dow Jones data) Market Data data Five of these 10 events took place during the era of the Great Depression, and all but one occurred during the tenure of Republican presidents.  However, if one were to insist on linking the occupant of the White House to the performance of the stock market, a better way to do it would be to track the average performance of the Dow Jones over the entire course of a presidency, rather than looking at one-day outliers in isolation.  To illustrate this, we looked at the average performance of the Dow over the course of the last nine presidential terms. We used Yahoo! Finance data for this, which only goes back as far as 29 January 1985, so we're missing figures for the first week or so of Ronald Reagan's second administration.  Average one-day percentage change in Dow Jones Average Industrial Index, Last Nine Terms   So while Donald Trump's presidency did see the largest one-day points drop in Dow Jones history, it has also seen the biggest average one-day percentage growth since 1985. However, this is based on only 12 months of data, and the next three years could see that 0.09 percent growth rate drop.  The biggest average daily percentage growth over the course of a four-year presidency was 0.08 percent, during Bill Clinton's first administration between 1993 and 1997.

[Kennedy] told delegates, I oppose Obamacare and any scheme that puts the government between doctor and patient. Four years ago, Kennedy made national headlines when, during a legislative task force meeting, he said, Sometimes access to health care can be damaging and dangerous ... Ive heard from National Institutes of Health and otherwise that were killing up to a million, a million and a half people every year in our hospitals. And its access to hospitals thats killing those people. That piece referenced a report and video from Salt Lake station KSTU, but neither source provided complete context. Kennedy was quoted as arguing against Medicaid expansion, and as represented, his remarks were accurately transcribed: report Representative Mike Kennedy, a Republican from Alpine, made the comments in a Health Reform Task Force meeting, in reaction to a story from another doctor. Doctor Kyle Jones told the legislature's Health Reform Task Force about a neighbor who was in a car crash. That neighbor suffered a rare response to pain medicine called toxic encephalopathy. The condition has caused memory loss, seizures and depression, according to Jones. \"Sometimes access actually can mean harm,\" said Representative Mike Kennedy, a family physician. The Republican from Alpine repeated the argument more than once: \"Sometimes access to health care can be damaging and dangerous. And it's a perspective for the [Legislative] body to consider is that, I've heard from National Institutes of Health and otherwise that we're killing up to a million, a million and a half people every year in our hospitals. And it's access to hospitals that's killing those people.\"  We were unable to locate any information substantiating Kennedy's claim that access to hospitals killed between one and one-and-a-half million Americans per year. It's possible Kennedy was referencing an ongoing study of the effects of medical mistakes, a topic that was the subject of research published in The BMJ in May 2016, but those figures estimated only 250,000 deaths due to medical error per year at that time. medical mistakes published Kennedy may also have been referencing research published in September 2013, in which researchers extrapolated between 210,000 and 400,000 deaths per year \"associated with preventable harm in hospitals.\" Authors of that study concluded that \"engaging patients and their advocates during hospital care, systematically seeking the patients voice in identifying harms, transparent accountability for harm, and intentional correction of root causes of harm will be necessary\" to reduce preventable hospital deaths but did not recommend restricting access to medical care as a preventive measure.

        ],
        "justification": "This typical female revenge legend, describing a woman's effective (but non-violent) way of striking back at her (former) partner, has been around since at least 1981. Legends such as these (see The $50 Porsche, for example) often feature a clever method of causing financial loss without the destruction of property: The $50 Porsche Examples: [Smith, 1986] A young couple living in the Bristol area had been having marital problems. Most of it was caused by the husband's bad temper and the fighting and constant arguing that had been going on for several months. Things finally came to a head one morning when the husband, just before he left on a three week business trip, told his wife they were finished and she had better get out of his house for good before he returned. When he arrived home his wife had gone, leaving the house in an awful mess. While he was clearing up he noticed that the telephone was off the hook. He replaced it and thought no more about it. Several weeks later the quarterly telephone bill arrived. It was astronomical  running into several thousands of pounds. He immediately queried it, only to be told that the phone had been connected to the speaking weather report in Australia for a three week period.  [Marsano, 1987] In Hollywood a man dumped his live-in girlfriend by telling her that he was off on a business trip and expected her to have cleared out of the house by the time he returned. Pretty cold, guy. The woman left, but when the man returned, he learned that she had found what Paul Simon might call the fifty-first way to leave your lover. The house was in good order, and the only thing was that the phone was off the hook. When he picked it up, he heard incomprehensible babbling, so he hung up. When his next phone bill arrived, it explained a couple of things. The strange language he had heard was Japanese, and it was giving the correct time. It had been giving the correct time enough to run up a bill of $80,000. Variations: Sightings:  An episode of the British sitcom Only Fools and Horses (\"The Second Time Around,\" original air date 29 September 1981) features the evicted woman leaving a note announcing she's dialed the speaking clock in America.

        "justification": "A genuine Michael Kors handbag for $7.95? Good luck with that. In early July 2023, we looked for the hidden catch behind a new scam that was originating in TikTok ads. The ads claimed that luxury design company Michael Kors was giving away handbags for a small fee of $7.95. All that users would supposedly need to do to receive one of the handbags was answer three or four questions in a short survey. However, this was not a giveaway that Michael Kors was managing, nor was it a legitimate promotion in any way, shape, or form. The TikTok ads misleadingly claimed, \"Michael Kors sends out handbags. Answer 4 questions and get a handbag.\"  Users who clicked on the ads were led to a page on 20mccsd.tech, a website that showedregistration information for a domain registrar in Russia. This may have been the country from which the scam was originating. showed The 20mccsd.tech website was designed to fool users into believing they were on the official website for Nordstrom, nordstrom.com. The scammers also made sure that anyone trying to visit the website with a copied link and not through a TikTok ad would see a strange facade that cloaked the fake Nordstrom website, as seen below:  As for users who did click on the ads, they saw the Nordstrom logo and the following text: \"Congratulations! You have been selected to participate in the Nordstrom campaign. You could win a Michael Kors handbag!\"  After answering three questions, users were redirected to exclusiveluckyshop.com. This website then claimed users would be eligible to enter into a supposed giveaway for a Michael Kors Voyager Medium Crossgrain Leather Tote Bag. This product normally retails for $298, according to Michael Kors' official website. website The scam had changed from promising handbags for $7.95 in the TikTok ads to instead saying that users would be paying the small fee simply to enter to win in a suspicious giveaway.  At the very bottom of exclusiveluckyshop.com, in a small font size, we found the terms and conditions. The terms included the catch behind the entire scam: Any users who paid the fee of $7.95 would later be billed $67.32 per month until they found a way to cancel. This monthly charge was purportedly meant to fund a $125 gift card for customers to use in what was referred to as a \"best consumer gadget club.\" In other words, this was a hidden subscription scam, a topic that we previously reported about with another scam. previously reported about with another scam  The terms also showed the phone number (866) 877-1602. In a call we placed to this number, an automated voice message thanked us for calling \"customer support.\" Just as we'd seen in past years with other scams involving CBD and keto weight loss gummies, no specific company name was announced like it would be when placing calls to legitimate businesses. If any readers fell victim to this scam, we recommend callingyour credit card company or the phone number for whatever payment method you used to make the purchase. Always bear in mind that if an online offer seems too good to be true, it probably is.

            "Did Henry Ford scavenge through junk yards looking for car parts that hadn't failed?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Automaker Henry Ford scavenged junk yards to find out which components had outlasted the useful life of his automobiles, then made those parts out of cheaper materials. LEGEND Example:  [Barrow, 1995] \nThere is a story about the late Henry Ford that illustrates the application of this strategy in the car industry. Ford sent a team of agents to tour the scrap-yards of America in search of discarded Model T Fords. He told them to find out which components never failed. When they returned they reported failures of just about everything, except the kingpins. They always had years of service left in them when some other part failed irretrievably. His agents wanted to hear how the boss would improve the quality of all those components that failed. Soon afterwards, Henry Ford announced that in future the kingpins on the Model T would be engineered to a lower specification.\n\n   Origins:  Henry Ford (1863-1947) is an almost mythical figure in American history. His vision of what the Model T would mean to ordinary folks impelled him to create what is still viewed as a marvel of transportation. On a larger scale, his use of the assembly line revolutionized the whole of manufacturing, not just the automotive industry. The Model T was specifically engineered to be affordable, reliable, and easy to maintain. The first ones rolled   out of the plant in 1908, and by 1918 half the cars in America were Model T's (or \"tin lizzies,\" as they were affectionately known). Fifteen million had been sold by the time the model was discontinued in 1928.  So where did this anecdote about Ford's alleged penuriousness come from?  These days people unfamiliar with Henry Ford the man tend to view him as a penny-pinching plutocrat or an engineering genius who took advantage of every opportunity to lower his manufacturing costs.  Both of these pictures are false.  Ford was not an infamous robber baron in the mold of turn-of-the-century America magnates such as John Jacob Astor and Andrew Carnegie, men perceived as grasping industrialists who ruthlessly exploited workers and consumers alike in their obsessive quests for wealth and power.  And although Ford certainly had his unsavory side (he was a moralistic man who insisted his employees adhere to what he regarded as proper standards of behavior both at work and off the job, as well as a notorious anti-Semite who avidly supported Hitler and who used his power to promulgate the fictitious \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\"), he was not a Scrooge-like manufacturing engineer out to shave costs wherever he  could. Ford was not a money-grubber. Profits were almost unimportant to him; provided he wasn't operating at a loss, he didn't much care if he made a lot or a little. Henry Ford became a millionaire almost as an afterthought to his love for his work. He took great pride in seeing his Model T's still on the road long after cars of similar vintage were rusting in scrap yards, and he paid his workers well to ensure his cars were built to last.  He viewed such longevity as a testament to his skill as a car maker. If he found some components of his automobiles never failed and outlasted the cars themselves, he'd likely have taken the discovery as an occasion to trumpet his engineering prowess, not a sign that he should sabotage his handiwork for the sake of bringing motorists back to the showroom more quickly. Times change, and planned obsolescence is now a fact of modern life. Our legend gives us someone to vilify for this shift, laying that responsibility at the feet of a manufacturer now almost universally disliked. That the legend would better fit just about any other car builder of that era than it does Henry Ford matters little.  Someone must have been responsible, therefore let's blame the one we'd like to see pilloried. Though the legend is almost always positioned as a \"let's screw the consumers\" tale, on rare occasion it has been presented as an example of intelligent design: \n\n[Diamond, 1997] One day, [Henry] Ford sent some of his employees to car junkyards, with instructions to examine the condition of the remaining parts in Model T Fords that had been junked. The employees brought back the apparently disappointing news that almost all components showed signs of wear. The sole exceptions were the kingpins, which remained virtually unworn. To the employees' surprise, Ford, instead of expressing pride in his well-made kingpins, declared that the kingpins were overbuilt, and that in the future they should be made more cheaply. Ford's conclusion may violate our ideal of pride in workmanship, but it made economic sense; he had indeed been wasting money on long-lasting kingpins that outlasted the cars in which they were installed.\n The basic legend can be twisted to produce other engineering triumph stories: \n\n[Collected on the Internet, 1996] A proposal was made to armour bombers in the places where the returning planes showed most damage from anti-aircraft fire. One young analyst suggested that instead, the planes should be armoured where the returning bombers showed no damage. He inferred that the planes that did not return were being damaged in the places that the returning planes were not. His suggestion was implemented and an X% reduction in lost planes resulted.\n (Some speculate the young analyst might have been Freeman Dyson, but it bears pointing out that legends are commonly ascribed to the famous people deemed most likely to have starred in them. Dyson did work for the operational research section of RAF Bomber Command in 1943, though.)

            "The practice of permanently inking the eyes is real, but it isn't as novel as it may seem."
        ],
        "justification": "Humans have been modifying their bodies as long as there have been tools available to do so. Tattoos, piercings, corseting, and other practices generally characterized as \"transgressive\" actually come with centuries of historical weight, and even newer types of body modification generally have precedents. Eyeball tattooing is no exception to this, despite popping up mostly in news stories after 2015, when an inmate in Alaska appeared in court with one of his sclera evidently tattooed:   Jason Barnum, also known as \"Eyeball,\" was sentenced to 22 years in prison for shooting a police officer. His face and eye tattoos came up during the sentencing hearings as well; the prosecution said that his tattoos showed a specific behavior pattern, and Barnum argued that poor decisions earlier in life had left him unable to find work. sentenced At any rate, eye tattoos are real -- and permanent. The BBC weighed in on the practice of eyeball tattooing in 2015, concluding that the tattoos are a strikingly visible way to proclaim one's individuality to the world: Looking a little out-of-this world is something that appealed to Kylie Garth, a body piercer who works in Luna Cobra's Sydney studio. Before deciding to change the colour of her eyeballs, Garth had experimented with a number of body modifications including face tattoos, piercings, elf-like pointed ears and a bifurcated tongue. \"It was mentally intense,\" she says of the several injections needed to colour her eyeballs a delicate blue-green, a colour she refers to as sea foam. \"It feels like somebody is poking at your eye, then it feels like strange pressure and then it feels you have a bit of sand in your eye, but there's no pain.\" In 2007, a handful of stories ran on the practice of eyeball tattooing, mostly focusing on a tattoo artist named Luna Cobra who tattooed Garth's sclera and who claims to have invented the modern practice: practice First and foremost, I, Luna Cobra, am the inventor of eyeball, or sclera, tattooing (tattooing the white of the eye in a solid or mix of colours). I first attempted the procedure on sighted human eyeballs in 2007 on three well-informed and consenting parties. Since then, I have fine-tuned both the technique and materials to increase the safety and minimize the risks of tattooing the eyeball. There are still risks involved, of course, but in the 8 years I have been performing this procedure, all my clients are all still ok. Secondly, I personally have not trained anyone else to do this procedure. I have appeared on various tv/news segments though, and have inspired many copycats worldwide. This is important to know because without the proper education, training, experience and guidance, these practitioners have caused vision impairments like blurred vision, spots or floaters, and even blindness. YES PEOPLE ARE NOW BLIND FROM EYEBALL TATTOOING. The practice of tattooing the sclera or the cornea (mostly the cornea, over the iris of the eye) stretches back to at least the first century A.D. and has been documented as a cosmetic enhancement (e.g., a way to alleviate unsightly scars on the iris) since then: documented Permanent colouring of unsightly corneal scars has been known for almost 2000 years. During the final decade of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century it was a commonly applied technique. Owing to the tremendous progress in microsurgical reconstructive procedures, corneal tattooing today will only apply for a minor and carefully selected group of patients. However, the procedure of coloring the whites of the eyes for elective cosmetic purposes has gained ground since Luna Cobra apparently developed it. That procedure is slightly less invasive, consisting of sandwiching pigments between the sclera and the conjunctiva of the eye, rather than depositing bits of ink just beneath the upper layer, as with a more traditional tattoo: tattoo Using the injection method of eyeball tattooing, where a larger area of ink is injected via a single hole, complex designs are not possible, and although fades from one color to another are possible to some extent, they can be difficult to control and master. The difficulty in controlling the spread of the ink makes this method inadvisable for the cornea (ie. over the iris and pupil) because of the danger of obscuring vision if the ink spreads over the pupil. Because only a few injections are required to completely cover the white of an eye with ink, many of the risks in the traditional method such as significant ink loss and ulceration are largely mitigated (although they are not eliminated). However, the injections can be difficult to control, and over-injection or injections that are too deep or too shallow carry significant risk  the appropriate zone is less than a millimetre thick, with serious consequences for missing it. The medical community uses almost exclusively the traditional tattoo method  although even after 150 years they have not come up with an agreed upon technique, which is very telling  whereas the body modification community uses almost exclusively the injection method. To date, attempts to tattoo the white of the eye using traditional needle methods have been extremely unsatistfactory, almost completely falling out. The general consensus is that injection is the only acceptable method of scleral tattooing. The end result of this method permanently turns the whites of the eyes another color to create an otherworldly, striking look.

Webster is challenged on many levels as he struggles to be a good husband, father and minister, while trying to control a nagging addiction to prescription painkillers, and an often rocky relationship with the church hierarchy, led by Bishop Beatrice Congreve (Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn), Roger Paxton, a senior warden of the parish and stalwart churchgoer (Dylan Baker).  The reverend also has loving, but challenging relationships with his three children: Peter (Christian Campbell), his 23-year-old gay son, who struggles with the loss of his twin brother; Grace (Alison Pill), his 16-year-old daughter who doesn't try to push her father's buttons but succeeds at it nonetheless; and Adam (Ivan Shaw), his 16-year-old adopted Chinese son, a handsome and cocky high school jock with a wicked sense of humor. Keeping Webster grounded is his strong and loving wife Judith (Susanna Thompson), who is fighting her own fondness for mid-day martinis, as well as Jesus (Garret Dillahunt), whose frequent chats with Daniel serve to remind him of his strengths and weaknesses.\n USA Today television critic Robert Bianco wrote of the controversial series: wrote \n\nWhatever else you may have heard about The Book of Daniel, it is first and foremost a show about a true-to-life, loving, complex family. It is also witty, earnest, intelligent, overdone, overly ambitious, wildly entertaining and superbly cast  which are just a few of the things that the people who decided to protest the show before it even aired have failed to mention.\n\n A total of 4 of NBC's 230 affiliate stations (in Beaumont, Texas; Meridian, Mississippi; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Terre Haute, Indiana) declined to air the series' premiere episode.  Five more episodes of the program are slated to air before the 2006 Winter Olympics, and two additional episodes  declined afterwards. Television critic Alan Sepinwall wrote a detailed article about the background of the show and its creator in advance of the program's first airing. article Gary Levin also reviewed the series for USA Today. reviewed Update:  On 24 January 2006, NBC announced it The Book of Daniel was being \"dropped from the schedule.\" Kevin Reilly, president of NBC Entertainment, said a letter-writing campaign from some right-wingers wasn't what killed ad sales for the show; it was that nobody was watching. The show had drawn an audience of 6.9 million viewers on its first night, but by its fourth airing, that number was down to 5.8 million.

        "justification": "A claim swept across the web following the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck Turkey and Syriaat4:17 a.m. local time onFeb. 6 that the natural disaster destroyed the ancient Gaziantep Castle. The castle is in the Turkish city of the same name. The quake was centered \"about 20 miles from Gaziantep,\" NBC Newsreported via data from the U.S. Geological Survey. NBC News Around 24 hours after the earthquake struck, The Associated Press(AP) was already reporting more than 3,400 deaths, showing just how devastating the massive quake had truly been. The Associated Press In our research, we found that Gaziantep Castle had been at least partially destroyed. This story will present our findings. In the aftermath of the earthquake and its many aftershocks, Twitter user @ThomasVLinge posted a before-and-after comparison to show the damage to Gaziantep Castle.  Eight minutes later, another Twitter user posted the same two pictures with the caption, \"2,200 years old Gazintap Castle destroyed by the earthquake in Turkey. Before vs Now.\"  The pictures featured in both of these tweets were accurate. The second photograph of the damaged castle was available on the Getty Images website and showed a date of Feb. 6. Getty Images Similarly, CNN.com reported, \"Ancient castle used by Romans and Byzantines destroyed in Turkey earthquake.\" Within the body of the story, it was reported that the castle had been \"badly damaged.\" reported Videos appeared to show a glimpse at the extent of the damage.  Additionally, we located a helpful picture that showed an aerial view of the damage to the castle. This view appeared to indicate that the damage had been devastating, but also that it wasn't a complete and total loss.  The APreported that the castle had previously undergone multiple renovations, with the most recent one occurring in the early 2000s: reported In Turkey, the powerful quake destroyed a historic castle perched on top a hill in the Turkish city of Gaziantep. Parts of the Gaziantep Castle's walls and watch towers were levelled while other areas of the structure were damaged, images from the region showed. The castle was first used as a watch tower and was expanded into a castle during Roman times. It underwent renovation numerous times, the last time in the early 2000s. At press time, it was unclear what percentage of the damage was from renovations versus what was part of the original works, a subject that was being discussed online. discussed According to \"Defence Sites II: Heritage and Future,\" the hill where the castle stood had a history that went backthousands of years. \"Archaeological excavation showed that the site has been inhabited from Iron Age 650 B.C. till Chalcolite Age 5500 B.C.,\" authorsC.A. Brebbia and C. Clark wrote. \"Traces of the castle were estimated to date [to the] Hittites. However, [the] main castle was first built in the 2nd and 3rd century A.D. in the Roman era and further enlarged and strengthened in Byzantium era by Emperor Justinian between 527 and 565 A.D.\" This story will be updated if further details come to light.

            "People could \"survive\" eating a very limited diet, health experts told us, but they wouldn't get everything their bodies needs to function."
        ],
        "justification": "The idea that potatoes can be a catch-all form of sustenance for human beings has been popularized at various times by public campaigns and movies, but health experts are split on the potential impact of \"surviving\" on just one type of food. This claim has been widely circulated online in meme form, with the slight modification of adding butter to the \"menu\" of the all-potato diet:   Katherine Basbaum, a cardiovascular dietitian for the University of Virginia health system, is skeptical of this meme's assertion. She told us that potatoes and butter would provide enough macronutrients for the body at a \"very basic level,\" but added that remaining alive and remaining healthy are two very different things:  There's a big difference between what your body needs to survive and what your body needs to work as best as it possibly can  to be as efficient, to be as healthy, to be as strong and it possibly can. There's a big difference between that and merely surviving. If you were hard-pressed and you had to do it, you could absolutely survive on it. Is it nutritious? Is it healthy and balanced? Absolutely not. Dana Hunnes, senior dietitian at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, disagreed slightly. She told us that this type of diet could be sustainable for persons who consumed enough potatoes to support their body weight and muscle mass. However, she said she would advise anyone looking to pursue that kind of regimen to instead eat a wider variety of fruits and vegetables. \"You can certainly survive healthily  it's been done,\" Hunnes said. \"Would I recommend it for people? No. Because I think you'd be bored in that diet.\" At least two public campaigns have touted the supposed merits of an all-potato diet. In 2010 Chris Voigt, head of the Washington State Potato Commission, promoted the merits of tubers by living off of them for two months. promoted \"I'm not encouraging anyone to go on this crazy diet, nor would my doctor,\" he said at the time. \"This diet was just a bold statement to remind people that there is a lot of nutrition in a potato.\" Voigt lost 23 pounds during that experience and denied rumors that he had abandoned his plan early. lost That type of short-term effort, Basbaum said, was unlikely to cause a person much damage provided that they not only had a clean bill of health but also no family history or risk of heart or kidney disease. Butter, she told us, is extremely high in saturated fats and can lead to unhealthy cholesterol levels.  \"If somebody came in here saying, 'I heard about this potato and butter diet,' I would tell them not to touch it with a 10-foot pole,\" she said.  Similarly, potatoes on their own are rich in potassium but are best enjoyed in moderation because of the threat they pose to the kidneys, which manage potassium intake for the body. \"If someone goes from a regular balanced diet getting the normal amount of potassium to just eating potatoes (like 20 a day or whatever), that's dangerous. It's not a good idea. You're overloading your kidneys with all of this potassium,\" Basbaum said. \"If you have someone with pre-diabetes or diabetes or at risk for developing Type 2 diabetes, I don't really want to put them on an all-starch diet. You're risking increased levels of blood sugar and the body producing way too much insulin for your own good.\" Six years after Voigt's efforts, an Australian man, Andrew Taylor, also made news when he announced that he lost 114 pounds after spending the year eating around eight or nine pounds of  potatoes per day on a \"spud fit\" diet. announced Taylor posted before-and-after pictures touting his weight loss, but Basbaum did not interpret the results as being fully positive. \"As a dietitian I don't look at that picture and [say] 'That dude lost a bunch of weight, good for him,\" she said. \"I look at the before and after photo and I can tell this guy is malnourished. You can see the wasting in his shoulder and his clavicle area. You can see that he's lost muscle tone, he's got barely any muscle tone in his arms. Obviously I couldn't diagnose him, but we do nutrition-based physical exams with our patients and you can tell that that guy wasn't optimum health. Not by a long shot.\"  Heavily-restricted diets gain popularity, Hunnes told us, because some people are seeking \"the magic bullet\" to keep them healthy. \"If someone says anecdotally, 'This works for me,' I think there's a lot of power in people being able to see with their own eyes what's happening to someone else,\" she said. \"I think that's the makings of a fad, particularly if a celebrity gets caught on to it or if a person has a lot of followers on Facebook or Instagram social media, posting those types of images is very powerful for people.\" For her part, Basbaum said that restricting oneself to that extent gives some dieters a feeling of control because it limits their margin of error.  \"But at the end of the day, these diets that ask you to either eat only one thing or ask you to eliminate an entire nutrient  take no fat or no carbohydrates at all  they don't work. They work for a time just like all diets,\" she added. \"But they don't work for everybody and they're not sustainable. What happens when you go off of it?\" In popular culture, the popular novel The Martian (which was adapted into a 2015 feature film) featured a subplot in which stranded astronaut Mark Watney grew potatoes on the surface of Mars and ate them to keep himself alive. Subsequent research by the International Potato Center (CIP) in Peru produced \"encouraging results\" regarding the prospect of growing potato crops on the red planet. research produced \"With this study, we have the basis for contributing to the so-called 'Bioregenerative Food System' proposed by space agencies, based on a space agriculture using local resources  such as soil  in future missions to Mars,\" lead researcher David Ramirez said at the time.

        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  A number of Menu pet food products have been recalled due to a possible association with kidney failure-related illnesses and deaths of cats and dogs. Origins:  The massive recall of pet food products manufactured by Menu Foods that began in mid-March 2007 (after those products, sold under a variety of brand names, were linked to kidney-related illnesses and deaths in a number of cats and dogs) has been a confusing and worrisome issue for consumers. Initial reports that all the suspected products had been recalled, that only can and pouches of Menu Foods wet food were affected, and that the recall problem was due to a form of rat poison (used as a pesticide) present in wheat gluten obtained from a foreign supplier have all since been contradicted. FDA testing of Menu Foods' products did not turn up evidence of rat poison, and the contaminant now suspected is melamine, a chemical used in the manufacture of plastics and as a type of fertilizer. Melamine has been found in wheat gluten (which serves as a binding agent and source of protein in pet foods) imported from China and used by Menu Foods, but toxicologists are unsure whether it is sufficiently toxic at the levels detected so far to have caused the reported cases of kidney failure in cats and dogs. Potentially contaminated shipments of wheat gluten have also been tracked to Hill's Pet Nutrition, Nestl Purina PetCare, and Del Monte Pet Products, and all of those brands have issued voluntary recalls of some of their products as well. We have compiled as comprehensive a list of recalled pet food products as possible from the information available to us, but pet owners should be sure to check all of the following sites to determine whether a particular brand (and form) of pet food is currently under recall: Menu Foods (cat products) Menu Foods (dog products) Hill's Pet Nutrition Purina Pet Foods Del Monte Pet Products FDA (Pet Food Recall) Brands and labels of pet foods that have been recalled so far include: \n Recalled cat foods    Americas Choice, Preferred Pets Authority Best Choice Companion Compliments Demoulas Market Basket Eukanuba Fine Feline Cat Food Lion Foodtown Giant Companion Hannaford Hill Country Fare Hills Prescription Diet m/d Feline Dry Hy-Vee Iams Laura Lynn Li'l Red Loving Meals Meijer's Main Choice Nutriplan Nutro Max Gourmet Classics Nutro Natural Choice Paws Pet Pride Pounce Meaty Morsels Moist Chicken Flavor Cat Treats Presidents Choice Price Chopper Priority US Save-A-Lot Special Blend Schnucks Science Diet Feline Savory Cuts Cans Sophistacat Special Kitty Canada Special Kitty US Springfield Prize Sprout Stop & Shop Companion Tops Companion Wegmans Weis Total Pet Western Family US White Rose Winn Dixie   Recalled dog foods   ALPO Prime Cuts in Gravy Americas Choice, Preferred Pets Authority Award Best Choice Big Bet Big Red Bloom Cadillac Companion Demoulas Market Basket Dollar General Eukanuba Food Lion Giant Companion Gravy Train Beef Sticks Dog Snacks Great Choice Hannaford Happy Tails Hill Country Fare Hy-Vee Iams Jerky Treats Beef Flavor Dog Snacks Laura Lynn Loving Meals Meijers Main Choice Mighty Dog Pouch Mixables Nutriplan Nutro Max Nutro Natural Choice Nutro Ultra Nutro Ol'Roy Paws Pet Essentials Pet Pride - Good n Meaty Presidents Choice Price Chopper Priority Canada Priority US Publix Roche Brothers Save-A-Lot Choice Morsels Schnucks Shep Dog Springsfield Prize Sprout Stater Brothers Stop & Shop Companion Tops Companion Wegmans Bruiser Weis Total Pet Western Family US White Rose Winn Dixie Your Pet   \n Pet owners who think their animals may have been affected by contaminated products should contact a veterinarian and their local FDA office if their pets begin exhibiting symptoms of kidney failure (e.g., lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting).

Members of the U.S. Army paid the sculptor, who had previously worked on a few other Saddam statues, to create the work pictured according to a design of their choosing: Example: [Collected via e-mail, 2004] This picture of the statue was made by an Iraqi artist named Kalat, who for years was forced by Saddam Hussein to make the many hundreds of bronze busts of Saddam that dotted Baghdad. This artist was so grateful that the Americans liberated his country, he melted 3 of the fallen Saddam heads and made a memorial statue dedicated to the American soldiers and their fallen comrades. Kalat worked on this night and day for several months. To the left of the kneeling soldier is a small Iraqi girl giving the soldier comfort as he mourns the loss of his comrade in arms. It is currently on display outside the palace that is now home to the 4th Infantry division. It will eventually be shipped and shown at the memorial museum in Fort Hood, Texas.  As part of the U.S. Army's Task Force Ironhorse, the 4th Infantry Division was deployed in Iraq for most of 2003, participated in the capture of Saddam Hussein in December 2003, and saw many of their comrades killed and wounded in the violence that followed the end of major combat operations. In mid-2003, while the 4th Infantry Division was headquartered in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown, Command Sgt. Maj. Charles Fuss, the division's top noncommissioned officer, headed up a project to commemorate the unit's dead and conceived of a memorial featuring the figure of a forlorn soldier kneeling to mourn before empty helmet, boots, and rifle  an array of objects that traditionally represents a fallen compatriot: Task Force Ironhorse 4th Infantry \n   Needing a sculptor to carry out his vision, Sgt. Maj. Fuss and other Americans asked around for local talent, and an Iraqi contractor recommended a 27-year-old artist named Khalid Alussy to them. As it turned out, Mr. Alussy was one of several artisans who had worked on a pair of 50-foot bronze statues of Saddam Hussein on horseback that flanked the gateway on the main road into the presidential palace compound in Tikrit, the site of the 4th Infantry Division's temporary headquarters. Commissioned by 4th Infantry Division officers to fashion the memorial conceptualized by Sgt. Maj. Fuss, Khalid Alussy (whose first name is also rendered in English as 'Kalat') took the assignment not out love for Americans, but because he needed the money: The officers didn't question Mr. Alussy further about his political views. Had they pressed him, they might have learned that he's harshly critical of the U.S. and bitter over an American rocket attack during the war that killed his uncle. In an interview, he says he thinks the war was fought for oil and holds the U.S. responsible for the violence and unemployment that have plagued Iraq since.\"I made the statues of Saddam  even though I didn't want to  because I needed money for my family and to finish my education,\" he says, reclining in a room decorated with several of his paintings. \"And I decided to make statues for the Americans for the exact same reasons.\" Mr. Alussy's initial asking price was far higher than the officers had expected. He blamed the steep price of bronze. So the Americans decided to recycle the bronze Hussein-on-horseback twins. \"We figured we were going to blow them up anyway, so why not take the bronze and use it for our own statues?\" recalls Sgt. Fuss. \"That way we could take something that honored Saddam and use it to remember all of those we lost getting rid of him.\" Without having to supply the metal, Mr. Alussy agreed to do the job for $8,000. By comparison, the former regime paid him the equivalent of several hundred dollars for his work on the Hussein statues. To finance the project, Sgt. Fuss publicized it in the task force's internal newspaper and asked officers to get soldiers to contribute $1 each. Within weeks, he raised $30,000.1 In July 2003, Army engineers blew up the two Saddam statues, cut them into pieces, melted them down, and delivered them to Mr. Alussy's house. (The delivery was done furtively in case Mr. Alussy's neighbors proved to be less than thrilled about his being in the employ of the American military.) Using a photograph of 1st Sgt. Glen Simpson as a model for the depiction of the kneeling soldier, Mr. Alussy began his work on the monument; near the end, another segment was added to his task: As the work neared completion, Sgt. Fuss and the division's commander, Maj. Gen. Ray Odierno, decided it needed a clearer connection to Iraq. The general suggested adding a small child to symbolize Iraq's new future, Sgt. Fuss says. When they told the artist they wanted another statue, Mr. Alussy demanded $10,000 more. \"He learned capitalism real fast,\" Sgt. Fuss says.1 After four months' worth of night and weekend labor, Mr. Alussy completed his assignment, and the statues were installed in an entranceway inside the 4th Infantry Division's headquarters in Tikrit. In February 2004 the statues were flown to the 4th Infantry Division Museum at the unit's home base of Fort Hood, Texas. Museum Fort Hood Somewhere along the line, this coda was added to the original e-mail: Do you know why we don't hear about this in the news? Because it is heart warming and praise worthy. The media avoids it because it does not have the shock effect that a flashed breast or controversy of politics does. But we can do something about it. We can pass this along to as many people as we can in honor of all our brave military who are making a difference.

            "Television service  providers charge tornado victims for lost equipment and early contract cancellations?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Television service  providers charge tornado victims for lost equipment and early contract cancellations. MIXTURE Examples:  [Collected via e-mail, May 2011] \nAs Joplin victims call Direct TV to cancel their service due to homes completely wiped off the map, they are being told to send in a box or remote control or pay a fine of $500+ to cancel service. DirectTV should be boycotted. Tell their employees to go to these former HOMES and find their remote controls...\n \n Over the last couple of weeks on facebook there has been a story traveling around in various forms. The first time I saw it it involved Charter comm in the Birmingham Al area. Supposedly customers who lost their homes in the tornadoes called Charter to cancel their subscriptions and were told by Charter that unless they returned the box and remote that they would keep being charged or pay a hefty fine for the loss of the box.\n \n It is going around on the web that Dish Network is requiring the victims in Joplin to either bring in their box or pay $500 to cancel their contract since they have no home or TV left to use it.  Is this true? \n Origins:  These items about television service providers requiring tornado victims to return their equipment or pay penalties began circulating shortly after several deadly tornadoes struck the U.S. between  March and May 2011.  Supposedly residents whose homes were destroyed by the twisters were told, upon calling their television providers to cancel their subscriptions, that they needed to either return the equipment (e.g., receivers/tuners, satellite dishes, remote controls) provided by those companies or pay hefty fees (said to be $500 and upwards) and in some cases pay additional monies for the early cancellation of their contracts. What customers may have been told (in some cases possibly by unaware or misinformed television service reps) or required to do appears to vary from company to company.  An article about an April 2011 tornado in Alabama noted of Charter Communications, for example, that: \n\nJust after last month's storms destroyed his Pleasant Grove home, Cleon Spain had a friend call Charter Communications to have his cable service disconnected. According to the friend, Glenda Dillashaw, a Charter representative told her that Spain would need to find his cable box or be charged $212 for its loss. \"I said, 'How are you supposed to find that?'\" The U.S. Steel retiree isn't the only storm victim who was told he'd have to pay for a cable box, according to volunteers working with the recovery effort. And while Charter says the truth is more nuanced, it doesn't rule out the possibility that storm victims could be charged for their lost set-top boxes. Charter encourages customers to file insurance claims for the lost equipment, said Kristina Hill, a spokesman for the company. Charter will \"work with\" other customers, she said, which might mean forgiving all or part of the debt  or it might mean coming up with a payment plan for the lost equipment. Indeed, as [Cleon] Spain searched in the rubble for car titles and other vital records, [his] cable box did turn up. When Dillashaw placed a second call to Charter  because a bill for the next month's service arrived  the representative told her not to worry about the box after all. While Hill told The Birmingham News the specific response from Charter will depend on the circumstances, she said the company \"will address all legitimate claims from customers in good standing and will work closely with them to remedy claims related to damaged and/or lost equipment.\" \"We realize that this has been a devastating life event for many of our customers,\" Hill said.\n That same article stated of other service providers that: \n\nBright House Networks also expects its customers to file claims under homeowners' or renters' insurance to pay for lost or destroyed cable boxes. \"That's how we normally handle it,\" spokesman Robert L. Smith said. If storm victims don't have insurance, he said, decisions will have to be made on a case-by-case basis. \"For those who have lost everything, talking to a cable company is probably the last thing on their minds,\" Smith said. \"We're not going to pressure someone for a set-top box.\" Among other television services, AT&T's U-verse customers who lost their leased equipment in the storm can have it replaced at no charge, company spokeswoman Sue Sperry said. DirecTV waives replacement costs for equipment damaged in storms if customers continue services, spokeswoman Vanessa Dunham said. If service can't be restored because of damage to the home, DirecTV offers to cancel the account and waive fees for not returning equipment, she said.\n A similar article reported that several cable and satellite providers (Comcast, Dish Network, DIRECTV and Charter Communications) in Alabama had established policies for customers affected by recent tornadoes: article \n\nComcast has notified customers in the Tuscaloosa and Huntsville areas of the following policies: o For consumers displaced from their homes due to the storms, their service may be placed on a temporary six-month \"hold\" status at no cost, which enables those with voice and data services to save their telephone numbers and email addresses. o Equipment (such as converter boxes and cable modems) that was damaged by the storm may be exchanged at the local Comcast offices at no charge. Consumers should notify Comcast if equipment was lost in the storm and cannot be recovered.  Although routine policy requires that a police report or insurance claim be filed on lost equipment, that requirement is waived for six months due to the extreme nature of the extensive storm damage. Customers will not be charged for the exchange or replacement of equipment under these circumstances.    o Customers who lost service will be automatically credited for that period of time.  It is not necessary to notify Comcast for this credit, which will appear automatically on customers' next bills.  Customers who still do not have service after their power was restored should contact Comcast. o Consumers may contact Comcast by calling 1-800-COMCAST.  The local Tuscaloosa office is located at 1131 Whigham Place. In addition, a temporary office and communications center has been set up at Belk Center, located at 2101 Bowers Park Drive, where local residents may use free high-speed internet and make free local and long-distance calls.  The Huntsville office is located at 2047 Max Luther Drive. DISH Network has similarly announced to provide free replacement equipment and free technician calls, at no additional cost, for loss of service due to the storms. If it is necessary to disconnect service, the company agreed to waive any fees.  Consumers may contact DISH Network by calling 1-800-333-3474.  DISH Network provided the following statement about its response: \"Taking care of our customers who have been impacted by any disaster, including tornadoes, is our top priority. DISH Network has a disaster policy in place and works with affected customers on a case-by-case basis to determine the best solution. We normally provide several no-cost options for victims to suspend their satellite service, including a pause of service, with no equipment fees.\"   Ellen Filipiak, Sr. Vice President for Customer Service at DIRECTV, stated, \"We join all service providers in Alabama in a sincere expression of sympathy for the people of Alabama who lost loved ones and homes in the terrible storms that hit the state last month. We are working with both our customers and employees in Alabama to help them rebuild as well as reconnect their TV services.  And to ease the burden and worry for our customers who were affected by the disaster, we have suspended accounts for those who were without power, offered free service calls and have waived equipment replacement costs and all other fees. More broadly we are also providing support to all victims of the storm through the Red Cross and Habitat for Humanity.\"  Consumers may contact DirecTV by calling 1-800-531-5000. A statement from Charter Communications comments about the storm crisis and its response. Kristina Hill, Senior Director of Communications, said  \"Realizing that this is a challenging time for our customers, we have waived fees for equipment that was lost, damaged, or destroyed as a result of the tornado. Charter's customer care team is standing by at 1-888-438-2427 to answer questions and to schedule service calls.\"\n Although another article stated that March 2011 tornado victims in Tennessee were initially told by DIRECTV that they were liable for early termination and equipment return fees, it also reported that the fees were waived for those customers after follow-up calls because \"the tornado zone in Greenback and Blount County had not been declared a disaster area, [so] the company was unaware of the widespread damage.\"   article DIRECTV has recently been repeating through e-mail and its Twitter feed that rumors of tornado victims' in Joplin, Missouri, being charged $500 for lost equipment are false, stating: \"This is just a rumor being spread around Facebook. We are not charging customers from Joplin to replace their boxes and we urge them to call us at 1-800-531-5000 so that we can assist them,\" \"This is a false rumor. We're helping all tornado victims and encourage anyone affected to call in,\" and \"We are working with customers in the affected areas. We urge those affected to call 1-800-531-5000.\" Twitter Last updated:  7 June 2011\n ",

            "A story that thousands of cattle were left dead after a winter storm was from 2015, not 2017."
        ],
        "justification": "In January 2017, a photograph purportedly showing a group of cows that had been apparently frozen solid was circulated on Facebook along with the claim that 30,000 animals had just died in a winter storm:   Both the photograph displayed here and its accompanying claim are legitimate. However, while this meme appeared again (and was mistaken for current) in January 2017, this graphic actually references a winter storm that occurred at the end of December 2015. Weather.com reported that more than 15,000 cows died during Winter Storm Goliath in Texas, while another 20,000 froze to death in New Mexico: reported Dairy producers in Texas and New Mexico have estimated that the number of animals that died during the recent Winter Storm Goliath will climb to more than 30,000. The winds are believed to be the cause for many of the animals deaths. It created drifts as high as 14 feet and pushed animals into fenced corners where they suffocated, according to The Associated Press. \"As Winter Storm Goliath wrapped up over the southern Plains, strong winds were associated with the storm's tightening pressure gradient,\" said weather.com meteorologist Quincy Vagell. \"When combined with snow, the winds were strong enough to create dangerous blizzard conditions.\" Executive director of the Texas Association of Dairymen Darren Turley said that an estimated 15,000 mature dairy cows died between Lubbock, Muleshoe and Friona, the primary impact area of the storm, AP also reports. This region includes the home of half the states top 10 milk-producing counties, which provide 40 percent of Texas milk. According to an agent with New Mexico State Universitys extension service, the state lost an estimated 20,000 cows. Like all agriculture, dairy producers always operate at the mercy of Mother Nature, said Turley. With Goliath, she dealt a particularly harsh and costly blow to the areas dairy producers, from the death of thousands of livestock they spend so much time caring for to a loss of milk production both over the weekend and in the future. The photograph is also real, although we were not able to determine a definite source. An uncropped version of the image was published by Tri-State Livestock News shortly after the storm, which showed a group of frozen (or near-frozen) cattle on the side of the road: Tri-State Livestock News   The other part of the meme heavily implied that the cows froze to death out of neglect, because nobody \"felt the need\" to bring them inside in the cold weather. The truth is, of course, more complicated. A January 5, 2016 report from the \"Houston Chronicle\" detailed efforts farmers undertook to protect their cattle from the freak storm: report More than one foot of snow on December 27 surprised ranchers and dairy farmers in a region accustomed to a few inches of precipitation each winter. Unlike their northern peers, Texas cattle raisers rarely own four-walled barns designed to keep cattle warn, often opting instead for open structures meant to keep Texas cattle cool during the long, hot summers. Forecast warnings of a \"historic blizzard\" came too late. Voinis said some cattle raisers had tried to build shelters with hay bales and machinery, to little avail. Some cattle were buried in snowdrifts formed by gale force winds. Others froze to death in the open, died of frostbite in later days or just disappeared. Initial loss estimates increased greatly in the days following the storm. A similar story unfolded in New Mexico, which was swept by the same storm: story Meteorologists sounded the first warnings about the storm some eight days before it hit on Dec. 26. Farmers prepared as best they could  putting down extra bedding behind wind breaks, placing extra bales of hay in front of calf bungalows and in places where snow typically accumulates. But as the blizzard raged on, cows that had sought shelter behind windbreakers were buried alive by drifting snow. Others froze to death on open fields. Calves that had been nestled inside hutches went hungry because no one could reach them. Farmers who tried to rescue their animals became disoriented and lost on their own land. We did the best we could for our animals, Ms. Beckerink said. But as the storm worsened, saving them meant risking the lives of her workers  a horrifying decision to make. The deaths of the cattle dramatically affected the livelihoods of farmers in both states. It is extremely unlikely that any farmer (dependent on their animals for money and food) would cavalierly leave their main source of income and food out in the snow to freeze to death, despite what this meme implies.

            "Reports of a secret tape recorded aboard the doomed space shuttle Challenger that captured the final panic-stricken moments of the crew raised suspicions of a cover-up."
        ],
        "justification": "Seventy-three seconds into the 28 January 1986 flight of the space shuttle Challenger the craft broke apart, killing the seven astronauts aboard. Videotapes released by NASA afterwards showed that a few seconds before the disaster, an unusual plume of fire and smoke could be seen spewing from the lower section of the shuttle's right solid-fuel rocket. It was generally assumed (and NASA did little to disturb this opinion) that all aboard died the moment the external tank blew up. NASA later conceded it was likely that at least three of the crew members aboard remained conscious after the explosion, and perhaps even throughout the few minutes it took forthe crew compartment of the shuttle to fall back to Earth and slam into the Atlantic Ocean. The agency was highly secretive about matters relating to the Challenger tragedy, actively fighting in the courts media requests to be allowed access to photographs of the wreckage, the details of the settlements made with the crews' families, or the autopsy reports, and this reticence to share information likely convinced some that there was more to the story than was being told. Such an environment breeds its own rumors, and Miami Herald reporter Dennis E. Powell wrote that the crew were likely all alive and conscious until the shuttle's crew compartment plunged into the Atlantic Ocean: When the shuttle broke apart, the crew compartment did not lose pressure, at least not at once. There was an uncomfortable jolt  \"A pretty good kick in the pants\" is the way one investigator describes it  but it was not so severe as to cause injury. This probably accounted for the \"uh oh\" that was the last word heard on the flight deck tape recorder that would be recovered from the ocean floor two months later. As they were feeling the jolt, the four astronauts on the flight deck saw a bright flash and a cloud of steam. The lights went out. The intercom went dead. After a few breaths, the seven astronauts stopped getting oxygen into their helmets. Someone, apparently astronaut Ronald McNair, leaned forward and turned on the personal emergency air pack of shuttle pilot Michael Smith. The PEAP of Commander Francis Scobee was in a place where it was difficult to reach. It was not activated. Even so, if the crew compartment did not rapidly lose air pressure, Scobee would only have had to lift his mask to be able to breathe. Two other PEAPs were turned on. The three others were never found. Though the shuttle had broken to pieces, the crew compartment was intact. It stabilized in a nose-down attitude within 10 to 20 seconds, say the investigators. Even if the compartment was gradually losing pressure, those on the flight deck would certainly have remained conscious long enough to catch a glimpse of the green-brown Atlantic rushing toward them. If it lost its pressurization very slowly or remained intact until it hit the water, they were conscious and cognizant all the way down. In fact, no clear evidence was ever found that the crew cabin depressurized at all. There was certainly no sudden, catastrophic loss of air of the type that would have knocked the astronauts out within seconds. Such an event would have caused the mid-deck floor to buckle upward; that simply didn't happen. A purported transcript of the Challenger crew's final horrifying moments has circulated online for many years, supposedly taken from a \"secret tape\" leaked from NASA: A secret NASA tape reveals that the crew of the shuttle Challenger not only survived the explosion that ripped the vessel apart; they screamed, cried, cursed and prayed for three hellish minutes before they slammed into the Atlantic and perished on January 28, 1986. The tape is said to begin with a startled crewman screaming,\"What happened? What happened? Oh God - No!\" Screams and curses are heard - several crewmen begin to weep - and then others bid their families farewell. Two minutes forty-five seconds later the tape ends. That's when the shuttles crew compartment, which remained intact after the vessel exploded over the Atlantic, hit the ocean at over 2,000 miles per hour, instantly killing the crew. \"Cover up? Of course there was a coverup,\" declared Robert Hotz, a member of the Presidential commission that investigated the disaster. \"NASA can't face the fact that they put these astronauts in a situation where they didn't have adequate equipment to survive. NASA doesn't give a damn about anything but covering it's ass,\" he said. The official account released by NASA ends with shuttle pilot Michael Smith saying, \"Uh-oh!\" Some NASA employees have evidently heard more - much more. And they provided the rest of the account based on what they've discussed within NASA in the last five years. The astronauts had time and realized something was happening after the shuttle broke up. \"All shuttle astronauts carry personal recorders and the tape in question apparently came from Christa's (McAuliffe), which was recovered after the shuttle disaster,\" said Hotz. Jarvis was sitting beside her, and when he figured out what was happening he said, \"Give me your hand.\" \"NASA insists there's nothing like that on tape but they're talking about the mission tape, not Christa's. So they're not lying, but they're not telling the truth, either.\" A journalist with close ties to NASA was even more emphatic, \"There are persistent rumors, dating back to the disaster, that this tape is absolutely bone-chilling.\" The following transcript begins two seconds after NASA's official version ends, with pilot Michael Smith saying, \"Uh-oh!\" Times from the moment of takeoff are shown in minutes and seconds and are approximate.

Rest in Peace However, this \"transcript\" originated with an article published in a February 1991 issue of Weekly World News, a tabloid famous for creating news stories out of whole cloth. There never was such a transcript, nor was the crew of the Challenger known to have been wearing personal recorders. Moreover, personal recorders would not have picked up the comments of crew members on different decks as the faked transcript would have us believe. Weekly World News Not everyone aboard died the exact second the external tank exploded; that much is known. A complete understanding of exactly what happened in that cabin after the explosion remains elusive because the impact of the crash, plus the six weeks the wreckage and bodies spent in the sea, made it impossible to determine precisely when and how everybody aboard died. (Six weeks in sea water would also have ruined any unshielded audio tapes that miraculously survived the explosion and the crash.)  If the cabin depressurized immediately, the crew would have lived about 6 to 15 seconds after the blast; if not, they might have survived for the full two minutes and forty-five seconds it took the cabin to fall 65,000 feet back to Earth. They most certainly could not have lived through the crushing 207 mph impact with the waters off the Florida coast, which negates the wilder versions of \"survived astronauts\" rumors that had them still alive for hours (and even days) under the sea, waiting for rescuers who could not reach them in time. Possibly the best clue towards solving the mystery of how long the doomed crew survived lies in what NASA learned from examining the four emergency air packs recovered from the wreckage. Three had been manually activated, which demonstrated that at least some of the crew realized something had gone wrong and had taken steps to save themselves. However, the fourth unactivated pack speaks with an even stronger voice, indicating that most likely realization of the circumstances and loss of consciousness were occurring at roughly the same time. That was the conclusion of Dr. Joseph Kerwin, director of Life Sciences at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. His July 1986 report was based on an official examination of the debris of the crew compartment, audio tapes and other data recorded on the shuttle, the remains of the astronauts, and photographs of the capsule as it fell after the shuttle exploded. In the report, Dr. Kerwin said: \"The cause of death of the Challenger astronauts cannot be positively determined, the forces to which the crew were exposed during the orbiter breakup were probably not sufficient to cause death or serious injury, and the crew possibly, but not certainly, lost consciousness in the seconds following orbiter breakup due to in-flight loss of crew module pressure.\" In other words, they might well have lived for the full spiral down and might even have been fully conscious for all of that hellish descent.

        "justification": "Claim:  Photograph shows an American Airlines airliner with an engine on fire. \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2004] \n\n\n777 Engine Fire At Takeoff This is an interesting photo of a very rare event in today's world.\nThe photographer was very lucky to catch this because the fire in the\nengine inlet resides there for only about a 1/20th of a second for\neach surge cycle. This is more than an engine fire as the title\nimplies. This is typical of a low pressure compressor surge (backfire) where\nthere are 1 to 3 successive \"cannon shots\" of fire balls spaced about\n3/4 a second apart. This means the engine is operating in excess of\n160,000 Horsepower and 1/40th of a second later all the Mach .70+\nairflow reverses direction from inside the engine. It projects a\nfireball from the power generating core combustor of the engine out\nthe front of the engine (surge phase). That fire ball is driven back\ninto the engine (the point of this photo at about 1/3 of a second into\nthe event cycle) by the forward speed of the aircraft and the residual\ninertia of the rotating fan. The airflow tries to re-establish normal\ndirection in the engine at this point due to the rotating inertia of\nthe engine rotors (recovery phase). Pratt & Rolls (this is a Rolls)\nengines may recover and operate at a reduced power level at this\npoint. But... If the engine has been damaged too much (e.g. broken blades & parts\nparticularly light built GE engines), the airflow will not resume a\nnormal path and the engine disintegrates. If the engine is only\npartially damaged, it will give you 1 or 2 more cannon shots 3/4\nseconds apart before the engine completely disintegrates. Either path\nthe engine takes, that is the almost complete loss of a $12M engine\nand a guaranteed sweeping job for the runway. The occupants seated\nnext to the failed engine will be temporarily deaf in one ear and all\nthe other cabin occupants will complain of ringing ears. The pilot\nwill think the controls have \"whip sawed\" him as the forces of the\nairplane are redistributed and then he forces them back to where they\nshould be. Looking from behind or in front of the airplane, it will\nappear to \"swerve\" to the airplane's left, dip the nose down and then\nslowly lumber into the air at a shallow angle on the remaining engine.\nWith all of the messed up airflow paths, the ECS system will receive a\nbig slug of raw fuel, partially burnt fuel & parts from the bleed\nsystem. The cabin will fill with a haze from the contaminated hot\nbleed air. Typical causes of this event are ingestion of a very large bird or\nobject, thrown fan blade, bad engine control commands from the\ncomputer, a poorly maintained engine or an engine that has simply worn\nout. Been there. Done that. Don't ever wanna do it again! \n\n\n  Origins:  A blazing engine fire may be one of the most frightening sights one could experience on board an airliner, but the  despite the elaborate explanation accompanying the picture above  scariest thing about this photograph is what a poor job someone did of editing it.  (One of the major tell-tale defects in this altered picture is that the flames from the putative engine fire aren't reflected in the shiny undersurface of the plane's fuselage, even though the engine's reflection is visible just below the red and white stripes under the \"American\" logo.) If there were any doubts about the falsity of this photograph, the existence of the unaltered image put them to rest: \n\n  Last updated:  6 October 2004  \n",

Okay? \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     Origins:  The first eight photographs in this series  showing a crane attempting to retrieve an automobile from a body of water, the crane tipping and falling into the water itself, and a second crane fishing both vehicles out of the water  are  genuine photographs of an incident that took place in Ireland at Roundstone Pier, Conemmara, Galway, around September 2004 (as described in one news account's breathless, paragraph-long sentence): Roundstone Pier described \n\nWe have certainly have had our ups and downs in the village this year what with somebody falling off the village wall, thank god not killed, and then in the wee hours of Saturday morning, a car goes into the Harbour, with a young man at the wheel, the car landed upside down and if it was not for the vigilance Mary King who  alerted Sean de Courcey, Sean fair play to him pulled this man out of the car, which was nearly totally submerged in the tide and pulled him to safety, what ever way you look at it, Sean saved his life, yet again another near fatal accident, and then I suppose on the slightly humorous side and to add insult to injury, a tow truck was called out to pull the car out, now get this, the truck fell in while trying to lift the car, no don't worry there was no one in it, it was remote controlled, but the machine was not heavier enough to lift the car out, therefore, a proper professional machine had to be called in, and the job was done, no loss of life, what was interesting the amount of people that came to have a look at this task you would think we had another social event going on.\n However, the final photograph showing the second crane also tipping and falling into the water is what makes this series particularly appealing to viewers, and it's a fake.\nThe second crane brought to the site did not also end up splashing into the water below: the last image in the series is clearly just a digitally altered version of the fifth image and not a genuine part of the depicted series of events.  Among other tell-tale signs, the bystanders to the right of the crane are in the very same positions in these two images, and the small white boat seen in the left-hand portion of these pictures has disappeared in the penultimate photo but oddly reappears in the last frame.

        "justification": "This email from the dawn of the millennium made its way to our inbox in 2003: This rather shocking photo was snapped in November 16th by a spectator at the collegiate power lifting championships at Pennsylvania State. The unfortunate competitor, who expressed a plea to remain anonymous, remembered to surgeons that he was \"stuck\" at the bottom of a personal best attempt in the squat lift when he \"sort of pulled his stomach in and pushed extra hard, at the same time as trying to complete the lift.\" He remembers a loud popping, splattering noise then a fierce stabbing pain and then not being able to move from the squat position. He remained in this position for about half an hour, since trying to stand caused him overwhelming agonizing pain.  Paramedics arrived and applied anaesthesia on the spot and carried him to an ambulance. He was rushed to surgery, where surgeons described the trauma as an \"explosive and aggravated prolapse of the bowel\". Meanwhile it was revealed that the weight was removed from his shoulders at the time of the incident by two \"spotters\" on either side of the lifter. The third spotter who was standing behind the lifter was unfortunately sprayed with fecal matter at the time of the incident. This spotter promptly fainted when he realized the extent of the injury to the lifter, who was a personal friend. This compounded the task of first aid officers who were at a loss as to how to treat the injury to the lifter in any case, who remained in the squatting position moaning in pain much to the consternation of the helpless audience. The hapless lifter had successful surgery to relieve the prolapse, but remained immobilized with his feet elevated in stirrups for 2 weeks to ensure \"internal compliance with the surgery and that the organs retracted successfully\". To add insult to injury, the ex-lifter required rectal stitching to partially occlude the anal orifice and stitch the rectal passage (which had significantly expanded and torn during the prolapse) and also was put on a low fibre low residue diet to combat flatulence to avoid any possibility of a recurrence. CBS news spoke to his wife and asked if she thought he would resume his power lifting career. \"Not if I have anything to say about it, would you like to risk something like that again?\" We agreed!!

It was taken near the Siberian town Cape Schmidt off the coast of the Chukchi Sea sometime in the 1970s and shows a man named Nikolai Machulyak. Machulyak was a bit of a local celebrity at the time due to his frequent encounters with polar bears. When rumors of a man who had \"tamed the beasts\" reached author V. Filimonov, he set out to find him. In August 1977, Filimonov published an article about Machulyak entitled \"  \" (\"I Ask For Your Friendship) in the Russian travel magazine   (\"Around the World\"): Around the World   Machulyak explained that a young polar bear was abandoned after a hunter killed its parent in December 1974. Machulyak fed the young polar bear, which he named \"Masha,\" for the remainder of the winter months until the bear left in the spring of 1975. A year later, he encountered a larger polar bear. While it seemed at first as if the bear was about to attack him, he soon realized that something quite different was happening. Here's how Machulyak explained the origins of this story to Around the World magazine (loosely translated via Google): In December 1974, a Chukchi hunter killed a polar bear that devastated its yaranga. After her there was a pestoon - a young bear, which I fed for five months: she had not yet learned to hunt. Called her Masha. In the spring of 1975, she left, and almost a year later I saw her again ... ... And suddenly this bear rushes to me. Often a person does not manage to unravel the intentions of the beast, but here I felt: this is not an attack. All bears are usually on the same face ... but then I realized - Masha! I stopped her with a wand. I always carry such a wand with me. Light, sixty centimeters. Masha was at a loss - this was visible in her face, at will, bypassing the wand, approaching me. She clearly recognized me ... And yet it was scary. After all, 11 months have passed since our last meeting. I immediately brought meat from the trap. She ate willingly. The Around the World article also included journal entries that Machulyak had written about his experiences with Masha. In them, he recounts his various encounters with her, such as the time he fed her seal meat from his hands. Masha wasn't the only polar bear that Machulyak encountered during this period. At one point, a larger bear named \"Marya Mikhailovna\" pushed Masha from her den. Machulyak was able to befriend this bear, too, as well as her cubs.  The Russian Geographical Society collected and published several other photographs of Machulyak and this family of polar bears: Russian Geographical Society   Although Machulyak had multiple encounters with these polar bears, he said that he always approached with caution: The beast is the beast. But every time I set myself up before a meeting. I mentally tell Masha, and not only to her, but to any bear: \"I ask for your friendship. Here is my hand in advance  palm up, there is no weapon, there is a can of condensed milk in it that you love. You are a beautiful, strong and amiable beast to me. I want to have a friend in you, and in friendship I will not be more faithful.\" . .  \"  .\"\r\n    .  August 1977.   .  \"  .\"\r\n  1 April 2014.",

        "justification": "On 24 May 2016, a Facebook user published the above-reproduced image of a partially blinded beagle, along with the claim that it represented the harmful effects of cosmetics testing on animals: published claim When cosmetics companies like L'Oreal want to test their products, they often use beagles. They take the potentially toxic ingredients in their products and stick them in the puppy's eye in large doses to test how much of a product is needed to cause harm. When they finish, they remove the Beagle's eye and start again on the other eye. When the beagle runs out of eyes, they kill him. This is why we never support animal testing companies. The photograph caused alarm and concern among animal lovers worried about whether the beagle's injuries were truly inflicted by L'Oreal (or any other cosmetics brand). A reverse image search revealed that the photograph had appeared years earlier on Portuguese-language web sites, with many English-language sites later using the same image to blame Mary Kay, Avon, or Procter & Gamble for the beagle's injuries: earlier blame    This doleful image was earlier published on a Brazilian web site, where it was identified as having been taken in the city of So Roque in relation to a controversy involving animal testing at the Instituto Royal laboratory, and it was also posted to Instagram in connection with rumors linked to that laboratory and location: published Instagram  An article published in the Brazilian version of the Epoch Times reported that the lab in question had been closed after protests by animal rights supporters and stated that the institute tested \"cosmetics and cleaning products\" of unspecified origin: article The Royal Institute announced it is ending the activities of the laboratory in So Roque, in the state of So Paulo. The decision comes after the release of 178 beagle dogs, used in laboratory tests for cosmetics and cleaning products, by protesters. The case was widely reported and generated discussions on ethics related to the use of animals in testing. The institute has been investigated by prosecutors since 2012 for their mistreatment of animals.  A 2013 news article also reported on the beagle controversy but made no specific mention of cosmetics testing at the lab in question: article A group of animal rights activists have been camped in front of the Royal Institute in So Roque (SP) since they stormed the headquarters of the laboratory, which conducts research for the pharmaceutical and veterinary industries, among others. The protesters, including members of the Black Bloc SP, accused the company of the ill-treatment of beagle dogs used in research. Protests against the Royal Institute began just last year. Activists claim that the company practices irregularities and criminal acts against animals ... The Royal Institute defends their research on their web site and says they respect all national and international standards in dealing with dogs in the laboratory. The company is an Oscip (Civil Society Organization of Public Interest) and receives public money thanks to the support of funding agencies for scientific research. Animal advocates say the company does not have licenses and permits for the activities it performs. Contemporaneous articles mentioned \"cosmetic and pharmaceutical testing,\" and a blog post claimed the contraceptive Norplant was among the products tested on the since-liberated beagles. Scientists who worked for the lab lamented the loss of a decade of research in the clashes with animal rights activists: articles pharmaceutical research For the scientific director of the Royal Institute, Joo Antnio Pegas Henry, the damage is incalculable. John Anthony said that the biggest problem was not the liberation of animals, but rather the destruction of the building, material, and especially of their research. \"[The activists] destroyed the laboratory, including computers holding research data. We can fix the material damage, but the damage to science is incalculable. There was material that was in its final stages after a ten-year study. Everything was lost,\" says John Anthony. According to the coordinator of the National Council of Animal Experimentation Control (Concea), Marcelo Marcos Morales, the institute in So Roque is the most important laboratory of the country in relation to such experimentation. While the precise origin of the beagle photograph purportedly linked to L'Oreal research is unknown, the image was originally circulated as one linked to a 2012 controversy involving the since-closed Instituto Royal of So Roque. Testing carried out at the lab while it was operational was not restricted to cosmetics, and most reports named pharmaceutical and household products as the primary substances researched at the Institute. The photograph has long since been repurposed to claim a number of popular cosmetics brands such as MAC, Avon, Mary Kay, and Head & Shoulders were responsible for the beagle's injuries. On L'Oreal's web site, the brand discloses their policy on animal testing, a position a representative for L'Oreal reiterated to us on 27 May 2016: discloses LOral no longer tests on animals any of its products or any of its ingredients, anywhere in the world. Nor does LOral delegate this task to others. The rare exception allowed is if regulatory authorities demand it for safety or regulatory purposes. This image was not the first spurious animal testing rumor attached L'Oreal on social media. Previously, a photograph of a sick rabbit unrelated to animal testing was circulated alongside claims that the animal was also a victim of cruel experiments carried out by L'Oreal.

            "Did a man survive an accident that poked an drill bit through one eye and out the side of his skull?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  A construction worker survived an accident that poked an 18-inch-long drill bit through one eye and out the side of his skull.  \nStatus:  True.\n Origins:  Although we dread the gory industrial accidents that leave their victims dead or result in the loss of a limb (or more), other types of on-the-job injuries can strike us as far more horrific. One such accident took place on 15 August 2003, when Ron Hunt, a Truckee, California, construction worker, landed face-first on a large drill  bit. Hunt was working in the Tahoe Donner Subdivision in Truckee, standing atop a six-foot ladder while drilling over his head, when he gave the drill an extra push to bore a hole.  As he felt the ladder begin to wobble out from under him, he tried tossing his power drill aside (a standard practice in the construction industry, intended to prevent workers from injuring themselves attempting to regain grips on out-of-control power tools) before falling to the ground.  Unfortunately, he wasn't able to throw the drill far enough away, and he landed upon it face-first.  The 18-inch-long, 1.5-inch diameter chip auger drill bit pierced Hunt's right eye and exited through the side of his skull.  As Hunt described the mishap: \n\nBy the time I was falling, and I let the drill go down, I was already on top of it.  The drill was facing up but it was off. When the drill hit, it just exploded my eye. It skewered me. I ran my hands up the drill bit, up to my eye, and put my other hand in the back of my head and felt it coming through the back of my head, and that's where pretty much the shock set in. The first thing I thought was 'Am I going to die?' I knew it was serious. I was scared. I didn't know if it was in my brain or not.\n\n The only other worker on the site that morning, Forrest Keating, heard Hunt call for help and rushed to assist him: \n\nThe first thing I saw was this drill sticking out about 6 inches from the back of his head and 6 inches out the front. It was a trip, like something out of a horror movie. I was amazed he was still alive.\n\n Keating removed his shirt and attempted to stem the flow of blood gushing from Hunt's eye by wrapping the shirt around the drill.  He then ran   300 yards to a nearby house to summon medical help, and when paramedics arrived they released the body of the drill from the bit and loaded Hunt onto a gurney.  Hunt (conscious throughout his ordeal) was then flown by helicopter to Washoe Medical Center in Reno, Nevada, where doctors pondered their options for treating the bizarre injury.  Miraculously, although the drill bit tunneled between Hunt's scalp and his skull as it came out of the side of his head, it pushed his brain aside rather than pushing into it, sparing him from death, brain damage, or paralysis.  Dr. Paul Ludlow, an ear, nose and throat specialist who was the facial trauma physician on call that morning, initially intended to cut off the drill bit but eventually decided that the best approach was to, in effect, unscrew it from Hunt's head: \n\nWe had to either cut down on it, which meant making a rather long incision through a lot of muscle, or just unscrew it - twist it all the way through and out. We would have cut it off, but after a few minutes of drilling, we noticed that it was loose. And so we just put down our blade and twisted the bit.\n\n Hunt had sufficiently recovered from his injuries by early September to appear on national television programs such as CNN News and ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"  Although he was truly fortunate not to have suffered more severe injuries (or damage to his motor or speech skills), he came away from the accident far from unscathed: besides suffering a fractured skull (which required a second operation to insert two titanium plates to reinforce the fractured bone), he lost an eye and now faces hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills and rehabilitation costs.  According to news accounts, Hunt is not covered by state compensation for on-the-job injuries, and he was a self-employed worker with no medical insurance. Injuries of this type always call to mind the case of Phineas Gage, who in 1848 survived an accident which blew a 3-foot, 7-inch tamping iron under a cheek bone and completely out through the top of his head.   Although Gage lived on for almost another dozen years, he suffered dramatic changes in personality and was subject to epileptic seizures in his final months.

This was nothing more than a death hoax. Roloff is one of the stars of the TLC reality TV series, \"Little People, Big World,\" which has often been referred to by fans with the acronym, \"LPBW.\" The Facebook page that posted the death hoax was managed from Indonesia. Its purpose may have been \"like-farming,\" something that the U.S. Better Business Bureau (BBB) has warned about in the past.

As of Nov. 21, the video had been viewed more than 53,000 times.  Note: It's unclear what the photograph originally showed, as a reverse image search for the men carrying the casket didn't find any matches for the picture. Days earlier, a video was posted to YouTube that also falsely claimed Roloff had died. The video had the title, \"10 minutes ago / We announce very sad news about 'dwarf' Amy Roloff, She has been confirmed as.\" We found no shortage of these YouTube videos, either.

While Roloff hasn't posted on her Facebook or Instagram pages since Nov. 18, we note again that the misleading YouTube videos we found were all published prior to that date. We found no credible reporting that said anything about Roloff recently experiencing a stroke or dying.

        ],
        "justification": "An unexpected controversy took root after the July 2016 Democratic National Convention (DNC) involving key speaker Khizr Khan, who took to the convention stage to speak about Donald Trump, Muslims in America, and the loss of his son, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan: Captain Humayun Khan   Khan's speech was preceded by brief introductory footage of Hillary Clinton describing his immigration to the United States, and how his son was killed in action in Iraq while guarding his Army unit. Khan reiterated his son's story and challenged Donald Trump (who has at times proposed barring Muslims from entering the United States) to read the U.S. Constitution: Like many immigrants, we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy; that with hard work and goodness of this country, we could share in and contribute to its blessings ... Our son, Humayun, had dreams too, of being a military lawyer, but he put those dreams aside the day he sacrificed his life to save the lives of his fellow soldiers. Hillary Clinton was right when she called my son \"the best of America.\" If it was up to Donald Trump, he never would have been in America. Donald Trump consistently smears the character of Muslims. He disrespects other minorities: women, judges, even his own party leadership. He vows to build walls, and ban us from this country. Donald Trump, you're asking Americans to trust you with their future. Let me ask you: have you even read the United States constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy. [Waved \"Pocket Constitution.\"] In this document, look for the words \"liberty\" and \"equal protection of law.\" Have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one. Trump repeatedly issued comments about Khan via Twitter as the Khans were being interviewed about the speech and about Trump's reaction to it: Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our \"leaders\" to eradicate it!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2016 July 31, 2016 I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2016 July 31, 2016  \nThis story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2016\n August 1, 2016  On 31 July 2016, the dispute escalated when Trump suggested to ABC's George Stephanopoulos and the New York Times' Maureen Dowd that Khan's wife Ghazala was silent during her husband's DNC speech because, as a Muslim female, she was not permitted to speak: Mr. Trump told Mr. Stephanopoulos that Mr. Khan seemed like a nice guy and that he wished him the best of luck. But, he added, If you look at his wife, she was standing there, she had nothing to say, she probably  maybe she wasnt allowed to have anything to say, you tell me. Mr. Trump also told Maureen Dowd of The New York Times, Id like to hear his wife say something. A day earlier, Mrs. Khan told MSNBC that she was unable to bring herself to speak at the convention due to her ongoing grief over her son's death: Ms. Khan did speak to MSNBCs Lawrence ODonnell, saying she cannot even come in the room where his pictures are. When she saw her sons photograph on the screen behind her on the stage in Philadelphia, she said, I couldnt take it. I controlled myself at that time, she said, while choking back tears. It is very hard. On 31 July, Ghazala Khan wrote an editorial for the Washington Post addressing the ongoing controversy. The same day Mrs. Khan's editorial appeared, bloggers Theodore and Walid Shoebat published a lengthy polemic stitching together circumstantial evidence to suggest Khizr Khan was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood: editorial Shoebat polemic The Muslim who attacked Donald Trump, Khizr Muazzam Khan, is a Muslim Brotherhood agent, working to bring Muslims into the United States. After reading what we discovered so far, it becomes obvious that Khan wanted to trump Trumps Muslim immigration policy of limiting Muslim immigration into the U.S. But not so fast. Trump we have your back. The Shoebats went on to cite two papers written by Khan in 1983 and 1984 pertaining to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, described as \"an intergovernmental oil company consisting of mainly Islamic countries\" and a second titled \"Juristic Classification of Islamic Law\" (both of which were written prior to the family's move to the United States). With respect to the latter, Shoebat bracketed a not-present \"Sharia\" in the title and included a snapshot of the only page of the paper freely available (which in no part suggested support for Sharia law or membership in the Muslim brotherhood and appeared to be an academic piece, not an advocacy paper). The Shoebats maintained that in the paper \"Khan shows his appreciation for the icon of the Muslim Brotherhood,\" referencing a citation holding that \"The contribution to this article of S. Ramadans writing is greatly acknowledged.\" page However, the quoted text was suspiciously elided from the screenshot that appeared on Shoebat and looked far less damning in its actual context as an academic footnote:  The elided citation was offered as support of the assertion that Khan's work was undersigned by the \"Saudi Wahhabist religious institution\" and cited a \"recent report\" that Khan had moved from Pakistan to the United Arab Emirates, \"a hotbed for the Muslim Brotherhood.\" That \"recent report\" was a Politico article that described the Khan \"familys journey from Pakistan to the United Arab Emirates, and from there to Boston,\" which in turn referenced Khan's 2005 interview with the Washington Post about the recent loss of his son Humayun. In its original context, the interview revealed a very different picture than the one painted by the Shoebats: article interview [Khan] and his wife would talk often to their three boys about why they decided to come to the United States, he began. It was the 1970s, and Pakistan was under military rule. They came to Silver Spring to have more freedom and opportunity. \"It sounds cliche,\" said Khan, 54, \"but that is the story.\" His son was always reading books about Thomas Jefferson; that part of his passion was certainly his father's doing. When the boys were small, Khan would take them to the Jefferson Memorial. He'd have them stand there and read the chiseled, curving words about swearing hostility against tyrannies over the minds of men ... It was not exactly surprising, he continued, that Humayun quoted Jefferson in his admissions essay for the University of Virginia, a line about freedom requiring vigilance. It was a bit surprising, though, when he signed up for ROTC and told his dad that after graduation in 2000, he wanted to join the Army. \"He said that it seems only fair and logical to join the Army,\" Khan said. \"Because he wanted to complete the journey  he felt that ROTC had completed him as a person, and he wanted to give back. That's what he wanted to do.\" It was logical, Khan said, and how was a lawyer going to argue with logic? Humayun finished his four years of service and was preparing for law school when the Army called him back to duty. As he was moving into Iraq last year, Khan called him and they spoke briefly, a conversation he has turned over in his mind a million times since. His son said, \"Remember I wrote that article for admission to U-Va.?\" Khan said, pausing, taking the pen cap off and putting it on again, his voice steady. \"He said, 'I meant it.' He said that. He wasn't going there through some thoughtless process, or thoughtlessly following orders. He thought he was serving a purpose.\" Khan recounted the details of his son's death to the paper in 2005, noting that by all accounts his son sent his unit to safety before running towards a suicide bomber: Over time, his colonel and his fellow soldiers told Khan how his son died, and that, too, had some sort of horrible logic to it. Humayun's job at the base in Baqubah was to inspect the soldiers at the gates, where crowds of Iraqis would sometimes gather. Humayun went early that morning, which was just like him. He saw a taxi speeding toward the gates, too fast, he thought. He yelled for everyone to hit the dirt. Then, as was his nature, he went running toward it, they said. \"Ten or 15 steps with his hand outstretched,\" his father said, stretching his own arm out in front of him almost a year later, telling some ghost taxi to stop in a downtown conference room. The explosives detonated before the car could ram the gates or the mess hall nearby, where several hundred soldiers were eating breakfast. The Shoebat page was something of a Gish Gallop, patching together a pile of loosely or unrelated details to paint a picture of a Muslim Brotherhood infiltrator in the Army who was killed before he could complete some undescribed subversive mission: Gish Gallop I can go on and on. Is it likely that Khans son was killed before his Islamist mission was accomplished? Only another type of investigation will determine that. Do they ever mention how many soldiers have died because of Muslim traitors? Do they ever bring up how many Christians in the US military were killed? Yet the modernists and homosexuals continue to attack Christians. But soon everything we need to know will be uncovered. As we say in the Middle East: the snow always melts and the sh*t under it will soon be revealed. The Shoebats' insinuations about the younger Khan directly conflict with all other published accounts about him. Had Humayun's intent in joining the Army been one of sabotage, there would be no reason to expect he'd ultimately lay down his life to stop a suicide bomber from killing scores of other American soldiers  yet by every telling, that is exactly how Capt. Humayun Khan died. The other big \"smoking gun\" Shoebat cited to support their theory that Khizr Khan is a Muslim Brotherhood operative is his work as an immigration lawyer. By their rationale, Khan bears a grudge against Donald Trump for the candidate's myriad statements about Muslims and immigration  but although it's true that Khizr Khan and his sons were Muslims immigrants to the United States, none of the \"evidence\" presented by Shoebat remotely supported the idea that Khan is an operative of the Muslim brotherhood. Not only were most of the points made about Khan by Shoebat unrevealing and tenuous, the heroic death of Humayun Khan flies in the face of claims the family were Muslims operatives seeking to harm Americans or work against U.S. interests. Capt. Khan enlisted in the U.S. Army by choice and died protecting his fellow soldiers; by contrast, the only \"evidence\" linking his family to the Muslim Brotherhood are irrelevant, decades-old papers written about OPEC and Islamic law by Khizr Khan before he immigrated to America.

It has now been verified that a new radical splinter group has broken from the main group of the Zero Population Movement. This new group, calling itself simply \"No More!\" has started to conduct a campaign of domestic terrorism, aimed at reducing the human population of this planet.   All staff are hereby advised to use extreme caution when using any public or semi-public restroom facilities, especially male staff members.   A confirmed 172 cases of maiming have occurred, with 13 resulting in the death of the victim. Many more cases are pending confirmation.    The \"No More\" group has designed an insidious device that they have been placing in the toilets in public restrooms across the nation. 6 have been found in limited access buildings.    The devices consist of a straight razor, a springload mechanism, and a pressure senser. The devices are cleverly hidden underneath the rim of the toilet bowl, and are not visible except by close inspection from inside the space of the bowl.    When a subject weighing over 120 pounds sits on the toilet, the pressure senser connected to the toilet seat activates within 5 to 12 seconds, causing the springloaded razor to sweep across the forward half of the toilet.    This results in extreme trauma to, or complete severing from the body of the victims testicles.   In 102 cases, this has also resulted in the loss or damage of between 6 and 54% of the victims penis.   3 female victims have also suffered minor lacerations. One to the buttocks, and two to the back of the thighs.   Plans are being formulated to share this information with state and local law enforcement agencies as soon as it is feasable, without chancing widespread panic amongst the civilian population.   Information gathered by the Detroit Field Office also indicates that plans are in the works to install these devices in private residences. Members of \"No More\" plan to install the devices while in the guise of service providers, such as plumblers. There is no evidence yet to indicate that this practice has yet started.   Inform all staff soonest. Staff on their days off should be contacted at home. Every effort should be made to also contact staff on vacation, medical or disability leave, or any other leave of absence.

This lack of reportage is tangentally alluded to as an effort to keep everything hush-hush so as not to cause a \"widespread panic amongst the civilian population.\" Rest assured the media would have broken such a story if any such attacks had come to the attention of even one reporter. It's equally ludicrous to assume the families of the thirteen men who supposedly lost their lives in this fashion would stand silently by, neither raising a public outcry to warn others, nor attempting to hold anyone accountable for the loss of their loved ones.

            "Legend claims women used to maintain slender figures by ingesting diet pills made from tapeworms."
        ],
        "justification": "In August 2014, an episode of Discovery Fit & Health's medical scare docudrama Untold Stories of the E.R. dramatized a supposed real-life scenario in which a teenage girl arrived at Florida hospital's emergency room with a bulging stomach, and the cause of the patient's malady was eventually revealed when she went to the bathroom and excreted tapeworms. The girl's mother then allegedly admitted that she had fed her daughter tapeworm egg pills to help the girl drop some weight before an upcoming beauty pageant: dramatized    At some point, the patient went to the bathroom and started screaming. \"It was a toilet bowl full of tapeworms. Blegh!\" [E.R. nurse, Maricar] Cabral-Osorio said. \"It was so gross and she had pooped all these tapeworms. There were a couple that were very long and wiggling around trying to get out of the toilet bowl.\" Trying to keep up the proper bedside manner, Cabral-Osorio told the patient that since the tapeworms were out of the body, she'd be just fine. One question remained. \"We were wondering how did she get those tapeworms, and then you saw the mom turn white,\" Cabral-Osorio said. \"The mom was apologizing to the girl. It's like 'I'm so sorry. You know, I did it just to make you a little skinnier. You needed some help before we went on to the pageant.\" Cabral-Osorio said the mother denied giving her daughter tapeworms per se, but admitted giving the girl pills with tapeworm eggs. This dramatization echoed a century-old rumor about women buying and ingesting diet pills made of tapeworm eggs in order to maintain slender figures, with the parasites taking up residence in the women's intestines and consuming a significant portion of their caloric intake, thereby preventing food from being stored as undesirable, poundage-adding fat and fostering the burning up of previously stored fat. Whether such a method of weight loss was actually ever a common or widespread practice remains a subject of debate. Purported vintage advertisements for tapeworm-based diet pill products dating from the early 20th century are often cited as proof that it was, but whether such products actually matched their advertised descriptions would be difficult to verify at this remove. Just because an ad for a diet pill proclaimed the product contained tapeworm eggs doesn't mean it really did  duping people into buying medicinal nostrums by way of making false and exaggerated claims was standard procedure in the days before government regulation of food and drug products. In the 1960s, memories of those ads resurfaced as appetite-suppressant candies came into vogue, prompting curious dieters to speculate on how they worked. By 1970, diet pills were all the rage, and amphetamines accounted for 8% of all prescriptions written that year. Simple reports about various wonder products evolved into appalling whispered-behind-hands tales about women so desperate to keep their figures that they routinely swallowed magic diet pills which were really tapeworms in capsules. Sometimes the tidbits ended there as \"Did you know ...?\" shared tales, but other times the buzz was expanded into tragic tales detailing the gruesome deaths that had befallen some beautiful but vain young things who were foolish enough to try such remedies. This rumor has been associated with a number of prominent women, such as German model Claudia Schiffer, but probably no one was singled out by it more often than opera singer Maria Callas (1923-1977). Callas was indeed afflicted with tapeworms, but not due to any \"lose weight quick!\" reducing scheme: she was overly fond of steak and liver tartare, raw meat dishes prone to contamination. In her case, the rumor about tapeworm diet pills collided with her real-life condition, resulting in her being misidentified as someone who used such a product. Compounding the error, respected newspapers passed along fatuous statements about her and this rumor as if they were revealed fact. (Example: \"Maria Callas, whose desperation to lose weight led her to swallow a tapeworm, shed several stones over a matter of months and never regained her former power,\" trumpeted The Guardian in 1992.) Some poorly-researched biographies have even claimed this as truth, falling for the myth instead of the reality. It's interesting to note many accounts of the Callas rumor spitefully and self-righteously conclude with the news that her indulgence in this ill-advised tapeworm diet fad caused her to lose the ability to hit the high notes. Such flourishes remind us that vanity rumors are often employed to humble women who aren't much liked or are seen as having attained high positions they did not merit. In Callas' case, her well-publicized, long-standing liaison with Aristotle Onassis caused some to belittle her talent by ascribing her success to her having a powerful benefactor; others wanted to find additional justification for disliking a woman who openly consorted with a (then) married man. The tapeworm diet pill claims usually posited that partakers eventually swallowed deworming pills once they had achieved their desired figures to be rid of the tapeworms, but the rumor also melded with a folk tale to form a new entity:   Other versions of how to draw out a tapeworm include placing milk, cookies, and a hammer near the afflicted person's anus for a few nights and letting the tapeworm gorge himself into complacency on the treats. Once this has been accomplished, the cookie is withheld. When the worm comes all the way out to demand, \"Where's my cookie?,\" whoever is stuck with worm-watching duty that night bashes it with the hammer. An alternative vermifuge calls for 29 steaks and a hammer: The patient eats a steak for 29 days in row, then fasts on the 30th day. The worm becomes closely acquainted with the hammer when it emerges to demand its T-bone. Baker, Ronald.  Hoosier Folk Legends. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1982.  ISBN 0-25-332844-6.

        "justification": "Claim:  Photograph shows Michelle Obama serving a government funded soup kitchen meal to a person with an expensive cell phone. REAL PHOTOGRAPH; INACCURATE DESCRIPTION Examples:  \n[Collected via e-mail, June 2009] Recently Michelle Obama went to serve food to the homeless at a government funded soup kitchen.   Cost of a bowl of soup at homeless shelter: $0.00 dollars Having Michelle Obama Serve you your soup: $0.00 dollars Snapping a picture of a homeless person who is receiving a government funded meal while taking a picture of the first lady using his $500 Black Berry cell phone and $100.00 per month cellular service: Priceless \n\n\n\n\n     Origins:  The above-displayed photograph is genuine, a snapshot taken on an occasion in March 2009 when Michelle Obama spent some time serving lunch to men and women at Miriam's Kitchen, a social service agency in Washington D.C., as part of the First Lady's effort to \"spotlight local organizations, connect with the city and help those in need amid the economic crisis.\"   However, all the assumptions and implications of the text accompanying this picture are incorrect or unsubstantiated.  To wit: \n The photograph does not depict anyone \"receiving a government funded meal\": Miriam's Kitchen is a privately funded organization with the goal of \"providing individualized services that address the causes and\nconsequences of homelessness in an atmosphere of dignity and respect\"; it is not government run or taxpayer funded. Miriam's Kitchen  A cell phone capable of capturing images (even a BlackBerry Pearl) is not necessarily a \"$500 phone\" with a \"$100 per month cellular service.\"  Many much more affordable options are available, including cellular providers who give free phones to low-income customers under the Lifeline assistance program.  So a homeless person might very well carry a cell phone, as Scott Schenkelberg, the Executive Director of Miriam's Kitchen, observed when questioned about this photograph during an interview: BlackBerry Pearl affordable Lifeline interview \n\nQ: Since the First Lady's visit, both your guests and your food have been the subject of some criticism within the blogosphere. For example, some critics noted that\none of your guests had a cell phone and suggested that it was inappropriate to serve free food to someone who could afford a cell phone.  A: I suspect some people don't understand how inexpensive cell phones are, or how critical they are to this population. These days, you can purchase a cell phone at 7-11 for $10, then pay for minutes as you go. Our clients have a very fragile safety net. Many of them don't have shelter and are extremely vulnerable. For them, cell phones could literally be a lifeline. If they're looking for a job, the cell phone would also be incredibly important  can you even imagine trying to apply for a job without a phone number? Cell phones simply aren't luxuries anymore. If a guest can scrape together some money to purchase a cell phone, I think that's wonderful.\n  The assumption that a truly homeless person wouldn't have (or couldn't afford) a cell phone is also a mistaken one.  As Scott Schenkelberg noted, the ranks of the homeless served by organizations such as Miriam's Kitchen include not just the long-term, chronically homeless, but also the \"newly homeless\":  those who had recently been getting by economically until a sudden job loss or other reversal left them with nowhere to go: \n\nUntil recently, we served mostly the chronically homeless, people who had fallen out of the economy long ago. More recently, we've been seeing more new faces, people who just fell into homelessness or other hard times. These people are generally high-functioning individuals who were hurt by the poor economy. It's very troubling to see previously self-sufficient people coming to Miriam's Kitchen in such high numbers.\n\n Last updated:  16 June 2009\n    Sweet, Lynn.  \"Can Michelle Influence what We Eat, Too?\"\n   Chicago Sun-Times.  6 March 2009  (p.

            "Does Illinois use photo radar in freeway work zones?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  The state of Illinois uses photo radar in freeway work zones. TRUE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, June 2009] \nIllinois will begin using photo radar in freeway work zones in July.  One mile per hour over the speed limit and the machine will get you a nice $375.00 ticket in the mail.  Beginning July 1st, the State of Illinois will begin using the speed cameras in areas designated as \"Work Zones\" on major freeways.  Anyone caught by these devices will be mailed a $375.00 ticket for the FIRST offense. The SECOND offense will cost $1000.00 and comes with\na 90-Day suspension.  Drivers will also receive demerit points against their license, which allow insurance companies to raise Insurance rates. This is the harshest penalty structure ever set for a governmental unit involving PHOTO speed enforcement. The State already has two camera vans on line issuing tickets 24/7 in work zones with speed limits lowered to 45 MPH.  Photos of both the Driver's face and License plate are taken. Pass this on to everyone you know who might be affected.\n Origins:  The short and sweet of it is that the information contained in the above-quoted alert regarding traffic fines in highway work zones in Illinois is relatively accurate. (We're not sure about that \"one mile per hour over the speed limit\" bit.) However, it does include one confusing aspect, and that has to do with dates. While the e-mail trumpets its news as something that will take place in July (thereby leading many readers to assume it means this year), in truth these  laws and their associated penalties have been in effect in Illinois since 2005. Indeed, the e-mailed alert itself dates to May 2005, which is when it first began bouncing from inbox to inbox. Why it was suddenly resurrected in June 2009 and again in June 2010 and flung about anew is anyone's guess. In July 2005 Illinois enacted tough new laws that targeted drivers who flouted work zone speed limits and by so doing endangered the lives of construction workers and other drivers. The full description of these laws and their associated penalties is detailed in a 30 March 2005 Illinois Department of Transportation press release, but the following portion is the relevant part: press release \n\nFirst-time work zone speeders, including those caught on camera, will be hit with a fine of $375, with $125 of that sum going to pay off-duty State Troopers to provide added enforcement in construction or maintenance zones. Two-time offenders are subject to a $1,000 fine, including a $250 surcharge to hire Troopers, and the loss of their license for 90 days. Starting in July [2005], State Troopers will deploy specially equipped vans that can take photographs of drivers speeding in IDOT and Tollway construction and maintenance zones. Tickets will be issued by mail to vehicle owners. In addition, drivers who hit a worker are subject for up to a $10,000 fine and 14 years in prison.\n Likely spurred by the renewal of interest in the e-mailed item, on 24 June 2009 the Illinois Department of Transportation issued an updated version of its 2005 press release.  press release These work zone \"slow down\" laws appear to be working. The number of deaths in construction zones in that state has fallen from 44 in 2003 to 21 in 2007 and 31 in 2008. (On average, there are more than 7,000 crashes in highway work zones every year in Illinois, resulting in approximately 2,600 injuries.) More than 8,000 speeding tickets have been issued via mail since 2006 when state police started using photo speed enforcement in construction zones.

An article published by theNew York Timesthe day after the attack also noted that Reagan cut his vacation short to return to the White House: noted \"There are no words that can express our sorrow and grief over the loss of those splendid young men and the injury to so many others,'' the President said gravely this morning, standing in the rain outside the White House after a hurried return from a golfing weekend in Augusta, Ga. The second photo displayed abovewas also taken the day before the Beirut bombings: before President Ronald Reagan, clad in pajamas and bathrobe, talking on telephone to Robert McFarlane and Secretary of State George Shultz, re urgent request from five members of Eastern Carribbean States on the situation in Grenada. However, the former president wasn't always necessarily quickto react after deadlyinternational incidents. After a Korean airliner was shot down by the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983, President Reagan remained at his ranch in Santa Barbara: remained At this point, (White House spokesman Larry Speakes) Speakes was interrupted and asked if Reagan was going back to Washington. He ignored the question and read a statement on the Middle East. Asked again if Reagan was going back to Washington, Speakes answered, \"There are no plans for the president to return to Washington earlier than anticipated.\" Speakes walked away from the podium and then came back to take questions. He announced, as he does every day in California, what Reagan intended to do that day: \"The president, as usual, is planning at horseback ride this morning and will generally work around the ranch in the afternoon. The weather there is as it is here, sunny and warm.\" Thesememes are based on an assumption that a U.S. president has to react immediately to breaking news of a violent incident or crisis by returning to the nation's capital, even when such an action does not facilitate the handling of the situation. When President Obama was criticized in 2014 for his reaction toMalaysian Airlines Flight 17 being shot down (reportedly by pro-Russian insurgents), reporter ChrisWallace noted that sometimes, \"the best thing presidents can do is nothing\": criticized I know there's like an immediate reaction, that you want to say he should have run back to Washington and gone back to the Situation Room. I know that a lot of folks at Fox here are saying that. As somebody who covered the White House and saw for six years Ronald Reagan in various situations, sometimes the best thing presidents can do is nothing, to continue on. If he had gone back to Washington and gone to the situation room  first of all, there's not much he can do, we're not in control of the situation. And it would have dialed it up. I was covering Ronald Reagan at that time [i.e., when the Korean airliner was shot down].He was in Santa Barbara at his ranch when that happened, and quite frankly he didn't want to leave. And his advisers realized how terrible this looked, and eventually persuaded him he had to fly back to Washington and had to give this speech to the nation, but it did take him four days. \n ",

        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Account describes women manipulating the short sales of properties. PROBABLY FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, January 2013] \nRecently, our good friend Michael (a local realtor) shared his experience with Leisa and I about an \"Obama supporter\" he encountered while showing homes to a low income, working family in Pontiac, MI. We asked him to please write it down so we could share it with you. As a Realtor for the past 28 years I thought Id seen or heard it all. Until now. I was showing homes in Pontiac, MI. one afternoon recently and showed up at a home at the 4:00 pm time my appointment was scheduled for. After I woke up the homeowner, she let us in and then proceeded to tell my buyers and I that she has already entered into a contract to sell the home on a short-sale. (A short-sale is a sale where the banks accepts less money than is owed on the home). After some chit-chat, she proceeded to tell us that she and her sister (who also lived in the area) were buying each others homes via the short-sale process. I mentioned to her that I thought relatives could not be involved in those transactions. She smiled and said \"We have two different last names so no one knows the difference\". She went on to tell us that each of them owed over 100K on their homes and were in the process of buying each others homes for about 10-15K cash. To top it off, they were each receiving $3,000.00 in government provided relocation assistance at the closing. My buyers and I were amazed that she was outright admitting to fraud and yet, she continued. She began to tell us that the best part of her scheme was that because they currently were not working that they (both) are now receiving Section 8 Vouchers. I said I thought those were for renters and she said \"Thats the best part; me and my sister are going to be renting each others homes so we dont even have to move, and Obama is going to give us each $800.00 a month to pay the rent!\" She then picked up a picture she had framed of Obama and did a little happy dance around her living room and while she kissed the picture she was singing \"Thank you Obama.... thank you Obama.\" So here is the bottom line Both of these scammers got at least $80,000.00 in debt forgiven, $3,000.00 in cash for relocation (when in fact they did not relocate) and to boot, you and I will now be paying (through our taxes) $1,600.00 in rent for each them each and every month .... perhaps forever! And I also would not be at all surprised if they are receiving food stamps and whatever other programs are available for anyone who is willing to lie to get assistance. These women went from working and paying about $900.00 each in mortgage payments to staying home and getting paid $800.00 each per month to live in the same home they had been living in and all they had to do was lie on a few papers. This craziness has to stop! Im sure this kind of fraud is going on each and every day all across the country and no one wants to touch the subject of entitlements because they might OFFEND someone or lose a vote or two. By the way ... she had an almost new SUV in the driveway, three flat screen TV's and a very nice computer set up in her living room which was furnished entirely with nice leather furniture. 'TIS THE NEW 'AMERICAN WAY'\n Origins:  The terms \"under water\" and \"short sale\" in reference to home mortgages have entered common parlance in recent years due to a severe downturn in the housing market.  The first refers to a mortgage that is greater than the property's current market value: If a home buyer owes $600,000 on a property that he originally bought for $900,000 but that is now valued at only $300,000, his property is described as being under water. The second refers to a process which has been used by some borrowers to keep afloat financially by shedding their under water properties. When a property owner holds an under water mortgage and can no longer make his mortgage payments, one remedy is for the lienholder to agree to a short sale: that is, to allow the owner to sell the property for less than the amount still owed on the loan.  A short sale leaves the lender taking a loss, but it is often preferable to the alternative of the lender's having to foreclose on the property and resell it  themselves (with no guarantee the resale would bring in any more money than the short sale did).     The unpaid balance still owed to a lienholder by the property owner after a short sale is known as a \"deficiency.\"  If the owner with the aforementioned $600,000 mortgage short sells his home for $250,000, he has incurred a $350,000 deficiency.  A short sale may or may not relieve the borrower of the obligation to repay that deficiency: whether it does depends on the agreement made between the lienholder and the property owner prior to the short sale.  (The amount of a deficiency is considered by the IRS to be a benefit which is taxable as income, but the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 currently allows taxpayers to exclude income from a discharge of debt on their principal residence.) The January 2013 item reproduced above purportedly tells of two women who are supposedly gaming the system by agreeing to buy each other's homes at short sales (in contravention of the rules), then collect a monthly housing assistance stipend for being renters in the homes they formerly owned.  The item contains no verifiable details such as names, dates, or addresses (only the mention of a city or state which changes from version to version), but the scenario described would require a number of implausibilities to all be true: \n A woman who was engaging in a scheme to defraud multiple lienholders and government programs would openly admit to that scheme and describe it in detail to a stranger.  The buyers and sellers involved in short sales are required to provide full financial disclosures and are subject to asset checks,\nmaking it highly unlikely that this cross-buying scheme could work.  A lienholder would almost certainly refuse to proceed with a short sale by an owner who had just bought another property, or to agree to a short sale home purchase by a buyer who herself currently had a property in short sale.  The $3,000 in relocation assistance provided to those who short sell their homes under the  Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives  (HAFA) program also requires financial disclosure and is not available to those who have purchased a house within the last 12 months, so neither sister would qualify. HAFA  Section 8 assistance offered under the Housing Choice Voucher Program (which provides payment of rental housing assistance to private landlords on behalf of low-income renters) is income- and asset-based.  Someone who not only owned her own residential property but was also functioning as a Section 8 landlord could not possibly qualify for Section 8 housing assistance.  Moreover, in many areas the waiting list for renters seeking to obtain Section 8 funds is years-long.\n Also, little of what is referenced here has any direct connection to President Obama. Although the HAFA program which provides $3,000 in relocation assistance was introduced by the Treasury Department under the Obama administration in 2009, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act (which exempts deficiencies in short sales from being considered taxable income) was passed in 2007 during the administration of George W. Bush, and Section 8 housing assistance was established under the Housing Act of 1937 passed during the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Last updated:  7 February 2013\n ",

            "Some brands of sidewalk chalk have contained high levels of lead."
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Some brands of sidewalk chalk have contained high levels of lead. \nStatus:  True.\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, March 2007] \n\n\nHi everyone, Be careful and only buy sidewalk chalk made from Crayola. Both of my children tested positive for lead exposure a few years ago. We had everything tested and it turned out to be sidewalk chalk. It was chalk they had gotten as a prize and it came from Joanne Etc. The only reason we tested the chalk is because a friend remembered hearing about a recall on sidewalk chalk in the past. The CPSC came to my house & took the chalk, due to its very high levels of lead.  Both kids are just fine, fortunately our Dr.'s routine check up includes lead tests for everyone, not just those in particular areas. So... if you have never had your kids tested, ask your Dr. And even if the package says \"Conforms to ___ standard\", if it isn't Crayola, don't buy it!\n Origins:  This e-mailed alert began circulating on the Internet in March 2007.  While we don't yet know the specific product referenced in the letter (the manufacturer wasn't named), there was indeed a   recall of certain brands of sidewalk chalk in 2003 because they were found to contain excessive amounts of lead.  In 2003, voluntary recalls were issued by both Target and Toys R Us for the \"Double Dipp'n Fun\" brand of sidewalk chalk then being vended by both retailers. Produced in China, the triangular chalk sticks were multicolored and sold for about 99 cents per package. Some 26,000 units were sold nationwide between March and July 2003. Target Toys R Us Given that there does not appear to be a current Consumer Products and Safety Commission alert about sidewalk chalk, there is reason to believe the March 2007 e-mail about lead being found in that type of product refers to the 2003 incident. Indeed, the letter's \"Both of my children tested positive for lead exposure a few years ago. We had everything tested and it turned out to be sidewalk chalk\" tends to indicate the product in question was the \"Double Dipp'n Fun\" brand that was subsequently recalled. As to why this matter is of note, while exposure to lead presents a hazard to all, it poses an especial danger to children. Additional care must be taken to limit their exposure to it. Lead poisoning can reportedly lower intelligence, cause mental retardation, memory problems, depression, fatigue, hyperactivity, aggression, hearing loss, liver or kidney damage, osteoporosis, high blood pressure and anemia. Very high levels can damage the nervous system, kidneys and major organs and even result in seizures or death. It can also lead to infertility in men and cause spontaneous abortion in women. In the final stages of lead poisoning, the victim experiences convulsions, paralysis, blindness, delusions, and then coma. People can and have died of lead  poisoning. In times long past, lead was to be found in numerous everyday items, including cisterns and aquaducts, pottery, pans, hair dyes, cosmetics, and medical nostrums. Toy soldiers were cast in it. Port wine was protected by it. Church roofs were covered with it. The presence of lead in everyday life has since been considerably reduced and our bodies are far less riddled with this deadly substance than were those of our ancestors, but this element will likely always be part of our surroundings and of us. The two major sources of lead poisoning in the United States have been lead-based paint, which was restricted in 1978, and leaded gasoline, which was phased out in the early 1990s. However, lead is still found in paint manufactured before 1978, in soil and dust (particularly next to busy roads or factories), in some imported or handmade pottery and tableware, and in imported home remedies and cosmetics. Yet most of the lead we take in comes from our diet. \"The average daily diet probably contains more than 200 micrograms of lead, of which about 10 micrograms gets into the blood, where it is joined by about 5 micrograms of lead from our lungs (depending upon where we live), so that our daily intake probably comes to about 15 micrograms and the body can easily rid itself of such an amount,\" says John Emsley. Lead finds its way into the food chain because all plants contain some lead, although not very much. Because lead is a naturally-occurring element found in the soil, it does manage to get into things. Care therefore has to be taken by manufacturers to detect its presence in goods destined for consumer use. Various lead-laden gewgaws and foodstuffs do arrive on the market, however, especially among goods produced in other parts of the world and imported to the U.S. In 2004, California's attorney general sued dozens of companies that make or sell imported candies containing lead, and in 2005 the California Department of Health Services urged consumers to stay away from candy produced in Mexico that contained tamarind or chili powder after tests found possible lead contamination in those edibles. In 1994 an outbreak of lead poisoning in Hungary was traced to the use of that element by an unscrupulous or unknowing manufacturer as a colorant in paprika.

        "justification": "Claim:  College student who restricts himself to only one foodstuff contracts scurvy. LEGEND Example:  [Dale, 1984] \nA man at Aberdeen University spent his entire student grant within a fortnight. In order to keep himself alive for the rest of the term he cooked as much porridge as he could, lined a chest of drawers with greaseproof paper and poured in the porridge to set. Every time he needed a meal he would cut off a chunk, fry it, and eat it. He found this spend-then-diet routine most satisfactory and repeated it term after term. At the end of his third year he was admitted to hospital as Aberdeen's first recorded case of scurvy in 120 years.\n\n   Origins:  This story has been part of the campus lore canon since at least the mid-1970s. It appears to be more common in Great Britain than it does in North America, but Canadian and American tellings of it have been recorded. Scurvy is a disease that strikes down those who are deficient in vitamin C (ascorbic acid). This illness is   relatively well contained in modern times, but in centuries past it took many lives, with its worst ravages noted among sailors whose long sea voyages kept them from having access to fruits and vegetables. (Vasco da Gama, for example, lost more than half his crew to this malady on his first trip around the Cape of Good Hope in 1497.) In 1747 lemons and oranges were fed to scurvy-riddled sailors with dramatic results, and in 1795 the British navy began doling out regular rations of lime juice during long sea forays (hence the slang term 'limeys' for British sailors), a practice that was highly successful in preventing the disease. Scurvy is characterized by general lethargy, anemia, pain in the joints and muscles, impaired wound healing, gum disease, and skin hemorrhages. Those who have it are impaired by weakness, aches and pains everywhere, and the loosening of teeth in their gums. The disease is quickly cured by dosing with vitamin C and easily prevented the same way. Scurvy The legendary student who comes down with scurvy is said to have attended various institutes of higher learning, and is sometimes described as a grad student. But the greatest variation to be found in the tale is in the diet that supposedly was the young man's undoing  different versions have the hapless grind dining solely upon: \n Porridge  cooked, stored, sliced, and fried (as in the example above)\n Porridge  cooked fresh each day and immediately consumed\n Ramen (a particular favorite in American tellings)\n Unadorned pasta (macaroni, spaghetti)\n Kraft Dinner (a pre-fab mix of macaroni and powdered cheese)\n Hot dogs\n Beer and potato chips (or 'crisps,' as they're called in Britain)\n Pork pies and Guinness (a stout beer from Ireland)\n The legend makes different points depending on how it's told. The porridge, ramen, and pasta versions present a woeful tale of a student who is forced by his poverty to restrict himself to one or two inexpensive foodstuffs which, though cheap, are nutritionally lacking. He contracts scurvy out of his inability to buy good food, his pursuit of knowledge thus bringing him to harm. Such versions underscore the privations of the scholastic life and are displayed by other (presumably better fed) collegians as examples of the hardships of student  life. In contrast, the hot dogs, potato chips, and pork pies versions deliver a just deserts message of an immature student acting in a hedonistically short-sighted manner, then having to pay the price for his folly. Such stories attempt to teach through example the necessity of the student's taking responsibility for his health when out from under parental constraint. Of course it is expected young people living away from home for the first time will go to bed later and eat less well than they did at home (mounted beggars race their steeds, after all), but the lesson here is to not take the kicking over of the traces too far lest dire consequences result. just deserts Surprisingly, a version one would expect to see does not surface: the fad diet. Search as we might, we've yet to encounter a telling in which a foolhardy diet regimen adopted by someone looking to drop pounds in a hurry causes him to develop scurvy. Given the proliferation of exotic weight loss schemes and the importance society places on thinness, this lack comes as a bit of a shock. Do we therefore perceive weight conscious students as being more nutritionally knowledgeable or common-sensical than their impoverished or immature counterparts? There have been real cases of scurvy in students brought on by their poor eating habits, but they occur far less frequently than the various tellings of the legend would have it. This is a legend that has traveled far beyond its occurrence, but real instances there have been  even if the \"porridge only\" aspect of the legend is missing from them. In 1967 a medical journal published an article on the sorry case of a 27-year-old Nigerian student living in London who came down with scurvy because he hadn't been eating fruit or fresh vegetables, and in 2003 Reuters reported on an unnamed student who had developed scurvy \"even though he was eating plenty of calories and had no deficiencies in most other vitamins and minerals. The student confessed to doctors that he ate no fruit and vegetables, consuming only a few types of foods  namely, cheese, crackers, soda, cookies, chocolate and water.\"  Scurvy is an illness that, though it belongs to another time, is still very much with us today even in affluent countries. It is more usually found among the elderly (who may be forgetting to eat right or whose fixed incomes restrict them to a limited diet) and alcoholics (who both forget to take care of mundane bodily needs like eating in their pursuit of demon rum and whose every cent goes towards liquor purchases). But it is also on the rise among the poor of well-off societies. The impoverished often stick to bad, unvaried diets deficient in vitamins, choosing convenience and ease of preparation over good food value. (It is possible to eat well on very little money, but doing so involves cooking dishes from scratch rather than from a mix or out of a box, a practice that is far more labor intensive and skill dependent.)  This poverty apparently extends to those attending university, according to the National Union of Students in Scotland, who in 1996 said student medical services had detected instances of malnutrition among undergraduates. In similar vein, a 1998 report from a university in the United States found that a significant number of students evidenced dangerously low levels of vitamin C.  Does this mean legions of college students are dragging their scurvy-riddled bodies to class each day? Oh, probably not. Though malnutrition and even vitamin C deficiency might be occurring often enough to be noted on campus, it takes a person twenty to forty days without vitamin C to develop scurvy. Remember, even very small amounts of ascorbic acid prevent this disease, and as well as the obvious citrus fruit sources (oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits), this key vitamin is found in a number of other fruits and vegetables such as strawberries, cantaloupes, papayas, raspberries, kiwi fruits, tomatoes, watermelons, green peppers, cabbage, cauliflower, spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and potatoes. A serving of any one of these will generally provide the recommended minimum dietary allowance (RDA) of 60 mg a day of vitamin C for an adult, but as little as a daily dose of 5-7 mg will prevent scurvy. Therefore, even a mere tomato slice a day should be enough to fend off this ailment or, for those really pinching the pennies, a quarter of a cup of cooked potatoes.

        "justification": "Claim:  Letter from former Marine criticizes Sen. Dianne Feinstein's gun control proposal. CORRECTLY ATTRIBUTED Example:  [Collected via e-mail, January 2013] \nSenator Dianne Feinstein, I will not register my weapons should this bill be passed, as I do not believe it is the government's right to know what I own. Nor do I think it prudent to tell you what I own so that it may be taken from me by a group of people who enjoy armed protection yet decry me having the same a crime. You ma'am have overstepped a line that is not your domain. I am a Marine Corps Veteran of 8 years, and I will not have some woman who proclaims the evil of an inanimate object, yet carries one, tell me I may not have one. I am not your subject. I am the man who keeps you free. I am not your servant. I am the person whom you serve. I am not your peasant. I am the flesh and blood of America. I am the man who fought for my country. I am the man who learned. I am an American. You will not tell me that I must register my semi-automatic AR-15 because of the actions of some evil man. I will not be disarmed to suit the fear that has been established by the media and your misinformation campaign against the American public. We, the people, deserve better than you. Respectfully Submitted,\nJoshua Boston\nCpl, United States Marine Corps\n2004-2012   Origins:  The shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, which left 26 people (including 20 children) dead prompted renewed political debate in the U.S. about gun control.  One of those who came out in favor of more stringent gun control laws was California senator Dianne Feinstein, who issued a statement on the day of the Newtown shootings proclaiming that: statement \n\nAs I have said many times before  and now repeat in the wake of yet another tragedy  weapons of war dont belong on our streets or in our theaters, shopping malls and, most of all, our schools. I hope and trust that in the next session of Congress there will be sustained and thoughtful debate about Americas gun culture and our responsibility to prevent more loss of life.\n A few days later, Senator Feinstein announced that in 2013 she would be introducing updated legislation to \"stop the sale, transfer, importation and manufacturing of assault weapons\": announced \n\n\"On the first day of the new Congress, I intend to introduce a bill stopping the sale, transfer, importation and manufacturing of assault weapons as well as large ammunition magazines, strips and drums that hold more than 10 rounds, Feinstein said. I am in the process of gathering support for the bill in the Senate and House. I have been working with my staff for over a year on this legislation, Feinstein added. It will be carefully focused on the most dangerous guns that have killed so many people over the years while protecting the rights of gun owners by exempting hundreds of weapons that fall outside the bills scope. We must take these dangerous weapons of war off our streets.\n On 27 December 2012, a former Marine named Joshua Boston posted the open letter quoted above (under the title \"No ma'am\") to CNN's iReport web site, stating his opposition to Senator Feinstein's proposed legislation. A CNN iReport producer noted that Boston: iReport \n\nWas a Marine and was deployed to Afghanistan between the years of 2004 through 2005. Although he is no longer in the military he acknowledges that he owns gun. He says he does not believe the government needs to [know] what guns he owns because he believes registration would lead to confiscation. He says the laws that are in place for gun control are plenty, and adding more laws will remove a means of defense for people. 'I own the guns I own because I acknowledge mankind's shortcomings instead of pretending like they don't exist. There are evil men in this world and there just may be a time when I need to do the unthinkable to protect me or my family,' he said.\n\n An interview with Joshua Boston can be read here. here Last updated:  3 January 2013\n ",

        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Studies link bread consumption to convicted felons, violent crimes, and poor academic performance and call for \"bread-free\" zones to be established around schools. \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, May 2006] \n\n\n!!! BREAD IS DANGEROUS !!! Research on bread indicates that: 1. More than 98 percent of convicted felons are bread users.\n2. Fully HALF of all children who grow up in bread-consuming households score below average on standardized tests.\n3. In the 18th century, when virtually all bread was baked in the home, the average life expectancy was less than 50 years; infant mortality rates were unacceptably high; many women died in childbirth; and diseases such as typhoid, yellow fever, and influenza ravaged whole nations.\n4. More than 90 percent of violent crimes are committed within 24 hours of eating bread.\n5. Bread is made from a substance called \"dough.\" It has been proven that as little as one pound of dough can be used to suffocate a mouse. The average American eats more bread than that in one month!\n6. Primitive tribal societies that have no bread exhibit a low incidence of cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and osteoporosis.\n7. Bread has been proven to be addictive. Subjects deprived of bread and given only water to eat begged for bread after as little as two days.\n8. Bread is often a \"gateway\" food item, leading the user to \"harder\" items such as butter, jelly, peanut butter, and even cold cuts.\n9. Bread has been proven to absorb water. Since the human body is more than 90 percent water, it follows that eating bread could lead to your body being taken over by this absorptive food product, turning you into a soggy, gooey bread-pudding person.\n10. Newborn babies can choke on bread.\n11. Bread is baked at temperatures as high as 400 degrees Fahrenheit! That kind of heat can kill an adult in less than one minute.\n12. Most American bread eaters are utterly unable to distinguish between significant scientific fact and meaningless statistical babbling. In light of these frightening statistics, it has been proposed that the following bread restrictions be made: 1. No sale of bread to minors.\n2. A nationwide \"Just Say No To Toast\" campaign, complete celebrity TV spots and bumper stickers.\n3. A 300 percent federal tax on all bread to pay for all the societal ills we might associate with bread.\n4. No animal or human images, nor any primary colors (which may appeal to children) may be used to promote bread usage.\n5. The establishment of \"Bread-free\" zones around schools.\n Origins:  This tongue in cheek warning heralding the dangers of bread has been part of the online world since at least 1998. It proves via example how easily wholly factual statements can be made to appear sinister and thus be used to further a variety of causes, some praiseworthy, some not. For instance, the list's second item, \"Fully HALF of all children who grow up in bread-consuming households score below average on standardized tests,\" sounds ringingly ominous until the reader pauses to consider that on any given test, half the takers will score above the median and half below it.*  Yet, by the way the statement is worded, one could easily be tricked into thinking the staff of life is at least somewhat to blame for poor academic performance. * The key to the humor piece is contained in its 12th item: \n\nMost American bread eaters are utterly unable to distinguish between significant scientific fact and meaningless statistical babbling.\n\n This humor offering works to remind us all that what we might at first blush take to be alarming truths laid bare by the unwavering light of science might actually be meaningless statements worded in such way as to arouse ire or stir up anxieties. In this, one is reminded of the apocryphal tale told of George Smathers, who, while running in a Florida Senate primary in 1950, supposedly decried his opponent thusly: decried \n\nAre you aware that Claude Pepper is known all over Washington as a shameless extrovert? Not only that, but this man is reliably reported to have practiced nepotism with his sister-in-law, and he has a sister who was once a thespian in wicked New York. Worst of all, it is an established fact that Mr. Pepper, before his marriage, he habitually practiced celibacy.\n\n The \"Dangers of Bread\" warning was likely an homage to an earlier Journal of Irreproducible Results article sounding a similar alert about pickles. The Journal spoofs, parodies, and satirizes what its editor calls \"the verbosity, pompous obscurantism, and sheer stupidity encountered in scientific publications and projects.\"  While some of its offerings are actual reprints from legitimate journals, most of its articles  are parodies written in technical scientific language complete with diagrams, tables, formulae, mathematical calculations, and nonsensical conclusions. In \"Pickle and Humbug,\" a list of similarly startling discoveries linked pickles to any number of societal ills. It reported that about 99.9% of cancer victims had eaten pickles some time in their lives, as had 100% of all soldiers, 96.8% of Communist sympathizers, and 99.7% of those involved in car and air accidents.  It was also pointed out that those born in 1839 who ate pickles have suffered a 100% mortality rate, and rats force-fed 20 pounds of pickles a day for a month ended up with bulging abdomens and loss of appetite. While such lists as those linking pickles and bread via dubious statistics to various bad outcomes are clearly works of humor, there is one surprising actual negative connection associated with bread: the baking of it contributes to the formation of ozone. When yeast ferments, it produces carbon dioxide and ethanol (alcohol). During bread's baking process, much of this alcohol is vaporized, producing the enthralling aroma that is loved so deeply by so many. When that scent goes into the air and mixes with nitrogen, if the sun, humidity, temperature, and wind are right, ground-level ozone, an ingredient in smog, is created. Bakeries that emit too much ethanol have had to install devices on their smokestacks to capture the pollutants.

            "Numerous tweets from conservative pundits misread the claim repeated by Thunberg, GritPost, and Forbes."
        ],
        "justification": "In March 2023, several media outlets and conservative pundits began sharing images of what they described as a deleted 2018 tweet from climate activist Greta Thunberg's account. That tweet, quoting from a now-deleted article, said, \"A top climate scientist is warning that climate change will wipe out all of humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years.\" tweet  Climate skeptics jumped on the deleted tweet as evidence of climate alarmism, insinuating that Thunberg's tweet suggested that, if climate science was accurate, humanity should be extinct at the time of this reporting. insinuating  Several problems exist with that narrative. First and foremost is the fact that the tweet and the article it linked to never said that humanity would vanish in 2023. Second, and also of crucial importance, is the \"top climate scientist\" referenced in the underlying article never actually said what these reports asserted him to have said. Here, Snopes untangles the controversy.  Yes, on June 21, 2018, Thunberg tweeted a link to a now deleted article on the website GritPost bearing the headline, \"Top Climate Scientist: Humans Will Go Extinct if We Don't Fix Climate Change by 2023.\" The GritPost article rehashed content originally published on Forbes about a seminar given by James Anderson, a Harvard University professor of atmospheric science, at the University of Chicago in 2018. tweeted deleted article content As reported by Forbes, Anderson's talk focused on the need for a massive effort to curb climate change over the next five years: reported People have the misapprehension that we can recover from this state just by reducing carbon emissions, Anderson said in an appearance at the University of Chicago. Recovery is all but impossible, he argued, without a World War II-style transformation of industryan acceleration of the effort to halt carbon pollution and remove it from the atmosphere, and a new effort to reflect sunlight away from the earth's poles. This has to be done, Anderson added, within the next five years. The assertion that humanity would collapse as a result of this inaction stemmed from statements Forbes attributed to Anderson about declining Arctic ice: Forbes attributed \"The chance that there will be any permanent ice left in the Arctic after 2022 is essentially zero,\" Anderson said, with 75 to 80 percent of permanent ice having melted already in the last 35 years. \"Can we lose 75-80 percent of permanent ice and recover? The answer is no.\" Based on Internet Archive records, the GritPost article to which Thunberg linked was deleted sometime after July 2020. Thunberg deleted her tweet sometime after Mar. 7, 2023. Thunberg did not respond to Snopes' request for comment. July 2020 sometime after The claim that a top climate scientist allegedly predicted the collapse of humanity in 2023 has been popular with climate skeptics since Anderson allegedly made the claim in 2018. The Forbes article and Thunberg tweet were both widely lampooned for their alarmism at the time. When 2023 came and humanity still persisted, these same actors were ready to relish the moment, as summarized by Newsweek: summarized [Charlie] Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, on March 12, 2023, wrote: \"One of the best headlines of the year so far... 'Greta Thunberg deletes 2018 tweet saying world will end in 2023 after world does not end.'\" Filmmaker [Dinesh] D'Souza, on March 12, 2023, added: \"Climate Radical Greta Thunberg Caught Red Handed: Deletes 2018 Tweet That Says World Will End Without Action by 2023.\" [Brigitte] Gabriel, founder of ACT for America, on March 11, 2023, also said: \"Greta Thunberg deleted this tweet because it exposes her for being a fraud. Make sure the entire world sees it.\" All of these tweets misread the claim repeated by Thunberg, GritPost, and Forbes. The point, as these individuals or outlets reported, was that humanity had to reach certain carbon emission benchmarks by 2023, or else catastrophic events decades to centuries later would be guaranteed because of feedbacks in the climate system. As Forbes described: The answer [to the question \"can we lose 75-80 percent of permanent ice and recover\"] is no in part because of what scientists call feedbacks, some of the ways the earth responds to warming. Among those feedbacks is the release of methane currently trapped in permafrost and under the sea, which will exacerbate warming. Another is the pending collapse of the Greenland ice sheet, which Anderson said will raise sea level by 7 meters (about 23 feet). Conflating the years scientists claim to be so-called \"tipping points\" with the year in which the end result of those tipping points is supposed to emerge is a rhetorical tactic common in climate-denial circles. Snopes has previously reported on the imprecise quotes contained in a 1989 Associated Press article misused in a similar way. a similar way Regardless of any Thunberg tweet, the claim allegedly made by Anderson that \"the chance that there will be any permanent ice left in the Arctic after 2022 is essentially zero\" has also recently been shared as evidence of climate \"fraud,\" suggesting Anderson made a failed prediction:  The Forbes article was the only place in which the content of Anderson's seminar was reported, but Anderson toldThe Associated Press that he never made that argument, and that his words were wildly misinterpreted in media reports: Anderson told \"That is a complete fabrication of what I said,\" Anderson wrote, referring to the claims he said humanity would be wiped out in five years. He said that during the seminar, he was displaying the most recent observations of Arctic sea ice volume  specifically the ice floating on the Arctic Ocean  and made the statement that \"the current observed rate of floating ice loss volume, there will be no floating ice remaining by 2022.\" The focus of the statement was on the floating ice volume and the observed rate of disappearance at that time, he said. \"Thus the statement was clear to those in attendance that the reference was to floating ice volume in the data shown on the slide, not arctic ice in general,\" Anderson clarified, adding, \"so, the 'wiping out of humanity by 2022' is a total distortion of what I said or meant at the University of Chicago colloquium in 2018. I would never make such a statement.\" Thunberg deleted a tweet that repeated an imprecise paraphrase of a climate scientist's 2018 seminar talk. While it is factual that she deleted this tweet, claims that the tweet argued humanity would end in 2023 are false. As such, we rate this claim as a \"Mixture\" of truth.

        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  FluMist, a flu vaccine delivered as a nasal mist, poses a greater risk to the public than the flu virus itself.  \nStatus:  Undetermined.\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, 2003] \n\n\nOctober 2, 2003\nRisks of FluMist Vaccine\nAn Investigation By Dr. Sherri Tenpenny\nwww.nmaseminars.com  MedImmune, the manufacturer of FluMist, recently announced that it signed an agreement that makes FluMist, the new intranasal influenza vaccine, readily available to people as they shop at Wal-Mart, the worlds biggest retailer. As the physician in charge of a bustling Integrative medical clinic, questions about vaccines frequently arise. After reading about the MedImmune-Walmart joint venture, I felt compelled to warn our patients and our internet subscribers of the potentially serious complications that may come from direct and passive exposure to this new vaccine. I also wanted to give a \"heads up\" to everyone regarding the onslaught of advertising that is about to besiege them. Hundreds of TV and print advertisements have been designed to persuade everyone into taking the FluMist plunge. The campaign will be the \"most intense, direct-to-consumer marketing campaign ever waged for a vaccine,\" costing an estimated $25 million over the next 2.5 months. In addition, Wyeth, MedImmune's partner, plans a three-year, $100 million campaign to encourage use of the nasal flu vaccine among physicians. [The rest of the article can be found on Dr. Tenpenny's site by clicking here.]\n clicking here Origins:  Although influenza is no longer the unchecked grim reaper of years past (in 1918 it killed half a million Americans and twenty million folks worldwide), it continues to present a very real danger even in these more modern times. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), millions of people in the United States  about 10% to 20% of U.S. residents  will get the flu each year.  Influenza also costs Americans $10 billion annually in lost wages and medical expenses. Worst of all, every year about 36,000 people in the United States die from it, and 114,000 have to be admitted to the hospital because of it. The flu is not just a week of feeling lousy and missing work; it is a disease that can, has, and does kill. Some people are more vulnerable to the ravages of the flu than others, which is why those who are most at risk need to be shielded from its contagion. Folks 65 years old and up, very young children, and those of any age who have chronic medical conditions need to be vaccinated annually against the flu. However, even those who aren't especially young, old, or  infirm should get that annual vaccination because avoiding the flu also means sidestepping many dangerous complications such as bacterial pneumonias, ear and sinus infections, and even heart disease and strokes. Yet it remains a sad fact that only a handful of people think to do this. Worse, their personal aversion is carried over to those they are responsible for: a parent who does not herself get an annual flu shot is far less likely to seek one for her child, even for one in the highest risk group. Flu vaccines have been available for many years, yet only 9% to 25% of children and young people with asthma get flu shots, and young asthmatics are one of the groups most at risk. Cost, inconvenience, and dread of injection keep people from availing themselves of this preventive. The stumbling blocks of cost and inconvenience are being eroded, however: the price of a flu shot is down to $17, and inject 'n' go stations spring up in pharmacies and other locations every October and November, so it's no longer a question of having to make an appointment with the family doctor and take time off from work to keep it. But a needle is still a needle.   Aversion to needles explains the appeal of vaccines that are sprayed into the nose: do away with the needle, and more people will choose to guard themselves from the flu. FluMist, a nasally-delivered spray, requires one squirt per nostril of a very fine mist to accomplish what an injection does, and every bit as effectively. There are trade-offs, though: the price of a spritzing with the nasal protectant starts at $53, making the injected version the more budget-conscious choice. Also, just as the more traditional encounter with a hypodermic can result in a couple of days of a sore arm, the inhaled vaccine has been known to cause runny noses. But these are minor concerns compared to the more troubling aspects of this new form of medicine. Flu shots are made from killed flu viruses  and are suitable for anyone 6 months or older. FluMist is made from a weakened live virus, so it isn't deemed safe for people with chronic medical problems or weak immune systems. For this reason, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved FluMist only for healthy 2- to 49-year-olds. Those under two years of age or over forty-nine must continue to make do with the injected vaccine, as must those who have other health problems. But even for the healthy 2- to 49-year-olds, the spray vaccine poses a risk, if not to them, then to those they come into contact with. In a few rare instances, those who receive this live vaccine will as a consequence spread it to others, so FluMist isn't recommended for people who take care of those with severely compromised immune systems who are being tended in protective environments. However, the CDC says: \"People who have contact with others with lesser degrees of immunosuppression (for example, people with diabetes, people with asthma taking corticosteroids, or people infected with HIV) can get LAIV (FluMist).\" says The live virus can be transmitted to others by way of coughing, sneezing, or talking, or via a fomite, an item touched by someone who has the virus. (Common cold, flu, and stomach viruses can live on the fingertips for hours, and they can survive on the surfaces of objects for days.) However, says the CDC: \"Because the viruses are weakened, infection is unlikely to result in influenza illness symptoms since the vaccine viruses have not been shown to mutate into typical or naturally occurring influenza viruses.\" Others in the medical field consider Dr. Tenpenny's analysis more alarmist than practical.  For example, she writes: \n\nAccording to information presented at the May, 2003 National Influenza Summit, approximately 85% of Americans between the ages of 20 and 50 go unvaccinated, and nearly 66% between the ages of 50 and 64 do not receive the flu vaccine. Have there been \"raging epidemics\" across the country due to lack of flu vaccinations? Hardly. The massive campaign to vaccinate everyone this year appears to be motivated purely by economics.\n\n As mentioned earlier in this piece, in the U.S. influenza annually causes about 36,000 deaths and 114,000 hospitalizations. While Dr. Tenpenny may not consider the loss of 36,000 lives a year to an easily-preventable malady a \"raging epidemic,\" others do. To dismiss the drive to have everyone vaccinated against influenza as \"motivated purely by economics\" when such an initiative could easily prevent most of those deaths strikes many as flat-out wrong.  It is true FluMist's manufacturer, MedImmune Vaccines, and its marketer, Wyeth Vaccines, have been advertising the intranasal vaccine heavily, especially in television ads. They've a product to sell, and they're intent upon selling it. But it can also be reasonably concluded that the availability of a non-injected flu vaccine will motivate many who would otherwise have gone unprotected to guard themselves against a disease that kills. People do fear needles, and their trepidation influences them to delay or entirely eschew vaccination. Take away the needle, and more will seek out the vaccine.  Some sources suggest FluMist will result in a protection against the flu virus that will last far longer than the protection imparted by injected vaccines, but this claim has yet to be fully substantiated. However, if this does prove to be the case, it would become a strong argument in the favor of the nasally-delivered protectant, because a traditional flu vaccination given in October can lose its effectiveness by March, leaving its host vulnerable to infection. The buzz about FluMist suggests its protection will last a full year.  (Repeated vaccinations are necessary to protect against new strains of the flu, and because the body's immunity to the flu declines over time.) There is a risk that a small number of those who avail themselves of the intranasal vaccine will pass the live virus used in it to others, but is there not a far greater danger presented by those whose fear of needles keeps them from getting vaccinated? They catch the flu, and they pass it to others, with the contagion so transmitted living on through their victims to infect even more. Vaccine, no matter how delivered, can stop the spread of virus.  Barbara \"marriage does not have to mean 'What's mine is yours'\" Mikkelson Update:  As of mid-November 2003, MedImmune had sold only 400,000 doses of FluMist and estimated that 50 to 80 per cent of those doses might be returned unused.  The primary factors behind the low sales figures were retail giant Wal-Mart's canceling plans to offer the vaccine in 1,000 of its stores, the fact that members of the target group for whom the FDA approved FluMist (healthy people from ages 5 to 49) rarely get flu shots, and consumer reluctance to spend several times more than the cost of a conventional flu shot in order to avoid a needle.

        "justification": "Claim:  Regulations taking effect 10 February 2009 prohibit the sale of used children's products that have not been tested and certified as meeting new standards for lead and phthalate content. FALSE Examples:  [Collected via e-mail, January 2009] \nThe Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act  (CPSIA) as signed into law will make it illegal for parents to resell or even give away their even gently used children's clothing (this includes books & toys also) come February 10th, 2009. The broad scope of the complicated law, and it's interpretation by CPSC has effectively made it illegal for parents to resell their children's clothing and gear at a garage sale, on eBay, Craig's List, through consignment stores or annual children's consignment sales. If donated to a nonprofit like Goodwill or Salvation Army, those organizations can't legally resell it, as of February 10th. That's right. Hand-me-down clothing, books & toys, for kid's age 12 and under, will be illegal to resell. It will be a banned hazardous product. The fines of $100,000, potential jail time and label  as a felon for violations are stiff. Please sign the petition and contact your  members of congress to keep used children's clothing legal: https://www.rallycongress.com/make-second-hand-kids-clothes-legal-/\n\n Origins:  On 10 February 2009, new requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) go into effect that dictate childrens products cannot be vended if they contain more than 600 parts per million (ppm) total lead. Also,  certain childrens items manufactured on or after that date cannot be sold if they contain more than 0.1% of certain specific phthalates or if they fail to meet new mandatory standards for toys. (Phthalates are chemicals used to make plastics more pliable.) Lead poisoning can lower intelligence, cause mental retardation, memory problems, depression, fatigue, hyperactivity, aggression, hearing loss, liver or kidney damage, osteoporosis, high blood pressure and anemia. Very high levels can damage the nervous system, kidneys and major organs and even result in seizures or death. It can also lead to infertility in men and cause spontaneous abortion in women. In the final stages of lead poisoning, the victim experiences convulsions, paralysis, blindness, delusions, and then coma. People can and have died of lead poisoning. Children are especially susceptible to its ill effects. The new law requires that domestic manufacturers and importers certify that childrens products sold after 10 February 2009 meet all the new safety standards and comply with the lead ban. News of this shook the world of those who have children themselves or sell children's products (e.g., toys and clothes).  However, on 8 January 2009 the CPSC issued an important clarification of CPSIA requirements stating that CPSIA testing regulations would apply to all new children's items but that used items were not subject to testing and certification requirements (although those used items still must meet CPSIA standards for lead and phthalate content).  As the CPSC said in that release: clarification \n\nSellers of used children's products, such as thrift stores and consignment stores, are not required to certify that those products meet the new lead limits, phthalates standard or new toy standards.\n\n In other words, according to the CSPC used children's items offered for resale after 10 February 2009 must still meet the new CPSIA standards regarding lead and phthalate content, but vendors will not have to have such items tested and certified. Vendors should therefore \"avoid products that are likely to have lead content, unless they have testing or other information to indicate the products being sold have less than the new limit.\"  In response to confusion over CPSIA regulations, on 30 January 2009 the CPSC voted to issue a one-year stay of enforcement for certain testing and certification requirements for manufacturers and importers of regulated products.   The CPSC reiterated in their announcement of the stay that thrift stores and second-hand retailers are \"not required to test and certify products under the CPSIA\": voted \n\nThe stay of enforcement on testing and certification does not address thrift and second hand stores and small retailers because they are not required to test and certify products under the CPSIA. The products they sell, including those in inventory on February 10, 2009, must not contain more than 600 ppm lead in any accessible part.\n\n A CPSC announcement issued on 6 February 2009 regarding that agency's enforcement policy also stated that they would not \"impose penalties against anyone for making, importing, distributing, or selling\" certain specified items, including any \"ordinary childrens book printed after 1985.\" announcement enforcement policy Of course, vendors of second-hand products still face the quandary that even though the CPSC has stated they are exempt from the testing and certification requirements of the CPSIA, they still have to ensure that the items they sell meet the new standards for lead and phthalate content.  Some vendors have responded by discarding inventory from classes of items they are unsure about, keeping track of recall notices, and contacting the original suppliers or manufacturers: \n\n\"We voluntarily did a reduction a year ago, removed all toys from the stores, all painted toys,\" said William Oakley, president and chief executive officer of Goodwill Industries of the Coastal Empire Inc., which is responsible for 14 thrift stores. \"We eliminated all child car seats and carriers because we have no way to confirm if they have been in an accident.\" Hazardous chemicals that makes plastic soft and squishy may be in certain toys and children's shoes and those have been taken from the stores as well, said Oakley, of Goodwill's regional office in Savannah. Each Goodwill store has a computer that is frequently checked for recall notices, the same procedure followed by Salvation Army stores. \"We are committed to following all the guidelines,\" said Nanette Hamilton, director of the Salvation Army in Camden County.\n\nShe said her thrift store began sorting through potentially harmful clothing and toys last year and is relieved that the law will not require thrift shops to certify that children's products meet lead-content standards.\n\n\"We don't have the means to test or certify. That would have impacted our sales because we sell a lot of children's clothes and toys,\" Hamilton said. \"The Salvation Army always provides us with a list of recalls and we go through everything in the warehouse before it goes on the shelves. We are very strong on keeping our children safe.\" [Consumer Product Safety Commission spokesman Scott] Wolfson stated that the law was not intended to drive resellers out of business. \"The target is the manufacturers of defective products,\" he said. \"We're calling for the proprietors of thrift stores to try and go back to the supplier. Was it tested? Was it certified?\"\n Last updated:  19 February 2009\n    O'Donnell, Jayne and Liz Szabo.  \"Safety Rules on Lead in kids' Products Perplex and Polarize.\"\n   USA Today  5 February 2009.

            "Abandoned wife receives a diet advice ad and kills her husband's girlfriend."
        ],
        "justification": "Legend:  An abandoned wife receives a diet aid ad in the mail, examines the \"personalized\" Post-It note affixed to it, concludes the ad must have come from the woman her husband has taken up with, and kills the homewrecker. LEGEND Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 1995] \nApparently there was this fella who left his wife of many years for a foxy little thing half his age.  The wife tried to get on with her life as gracefully as possible, but this wasn't easy for her husband was now living with his girlfriend and the two of them were reputed to be painting the town red.  In other words, seemed everywhere she turned she was getting her nose rubbed in it.  One day she received one of these diet advertisements with the cutesy \"Linda, Try this  it works! J.\" note stuck to it. Unfortunately for all concerned, the girlfriend's initial was \"J\" and in the wife's mind there could be no doubt that her husband's bouncy ball of fluff was the sender.  Bad enough to lose her husband to 36-24-36, but to have the smirking little bitch then send her something like this disguised as \"friendly advice\"?!?! Wifey marches over to the love nest.  When ball of fluff answers the door, she shoots twice, and there's one less cheerleader in the world. Origins:  This story about an ad campaign gone murderously awry has been kicking about since the late 1980s. While in many of the tellings, the jilted older wife fatally shoots the far younger gal the philandering husband is now living with under the mistaken belief the floozy had sent the \"Try this  it works!\" note, we've encountered tellings where the murdered woman was said to be the cheating husband's new wife and others where the victim was strangled instead of shot. The nature of the product being advertised varied too: while the misunderstood ad pitch was sometimes for a weight-loss system or diet aid, it was sometimes for anti-aging products. One reader reported hearing the following unusual completion of the legend: \n\n[Collected via e-mail, 2002] I heard almost the exact same tale, but the version I heard is that, after the wife kills the girlfriend, she goes home to find a friend just leaving her doorstop.  The friend asks her if she had received the diet plan that the friend had mailed her.  The friend had tried it, and it really worked and she thought the wife would like to try it. The wife realizes what she had done and collapses.\n Another of our readers heard the same legend, but minus the \"Try this  it works!\" advertisement: \n\n[Collected via e-mail, 2006] I heard a similar tale several years ago as well. Only in this story, the husband's new girlfriend works at an eatery in the mall.  The former wife doesn't realize this and walks up to order a Coke.  The girlfriend takes her money with a smirk and hands her the drink.  The wife walks away fuming at having been served by THAT WOMAN! When she takes a drink of the Coke, she realizes that she was given a DIET COKE instead. She fumes because she knows that this is the girlfriend's way of saying she's fat and can use diet soda. So then the story gets back on track, she goes to their new house, shoots twice and there's one less cheerleader in the world.\n While the murdered bimbo story is an urban legend as opposed to a report of something that actually happened, the direct mail advertising method on which it is based is indeed real. A  number of companies doing business through the mails have at various times used the \"personalized Post-It note stuck to what appears to be a page torn from a respected publication\" ploy. This form of marketing works on the assumption that the recipient (aka, sucker) will mistake a tearsheet touting a miracle product for an impartial article from a reputable magazine or newspaper, and will give it additional credence because it appears to come from a friend who is attempting to pass along helpful information. The standard accompanying note takes the form of a \"[insert first name], Try this  it works!\" entreaty signed with a common initial. The envelope it arrives in appears to have been addressed by hand or to have been individually typed on a rickety old typewriter, bears a real stamp in the upper right-hand corner (no postage meter mark, in other words), and does not look like the impersonal piece of direct mail advertising it is. Instead, it closely resembles what it's supposed to mimic: something a friend would tear out and mail to you.  Some examples of companies' using this form of direct mail advertising include the following: \n In 1991, tearsheets for Gero Vita GH 3 Famous Romanian Anti-Aging Formula emblazoned with \"John, try it. This works! R.\" popped up in folks' mail. In 1993 the same product was being marketed the same way, with only the sticky modified to read \"Eugene. Try it. It's only 1/2 price!\"  An outfit known as Georgetown Publishing, who was pushing $297 books entitled \"American Speaker\" and \"Business Finance Advisor,\" used this method in 1995. The FTC took them to task for it, and in 1996 they reached a settlement under which the respondents were prohibited from misrepresenting an advertisement as an independent review or article, or failing to identify it as a paid advertisement. In addition, the order prohibited the respondents from misrepresenting their products as having been independently reviewed or evaluated. (That FTC settlement hasn't completely stopped this form of marketing, however. In 1999 \"Try this  it works!\" Post-Its appeared on tearsheets mailed to Canadians targeted as potential buyers of  \"The Organised Executive,\" a monthly newsletter and Q&A service costing $197 a year.)  FTC  In 1997, Health Laboratories of North America, a firm marketing \"Berry Trim Plus\" diet pills, also came up with such a mailing but managed to bring it in under the FTC's radar by making their tearsheet look like a newspaper ad rather than an independent review, the feature that had been the downfall of Georgetown Publishing. Still, with a sticky note containing the usual \"Try this  it works!\" pitch, the clipping looked like it had been sent by an acquaintance, and this had been one of the deceptive advertising practices which the FTC had charged Georgetown with employing. Berry Trim has had its knuckles rapped by the Better Business Bureau over this practice, but that hasn't stopped the diet pill manufacturer from using it. As of 2000, Berry Trim was also sending the online equivalent of these ads in the form of spam e-mail messages.\n In other words, though this form of advertising is at least borderline illegal at the moment, don't kid yourself that we've seen the end of such mailings. The reaction of those who receive such solicitations can well be imagined. But for those experiencing difficulty quite picturing it, we offer a 1996 letter from one of Ann Lander's readers: \n\nDear Ann: I had to write after reading the letter from \"Roseville, Calif.\" Her sister had just found a note taped to her windshield telling her she was overweight and should do something about it. I recently had a similar experience. I received an advertisement for a weight-loss program clipped from a newspaper. It came in the mail. On it was written, \"Mary, try it.  It works.\" There was no signature or return address. I have been to five doctors in six years. The last one figured out why I am struggling so hard to lose weight. It's my metabolism.  I am slowly getting the unwanted pounds off and don't need any advice from anonymous \"do-gooders.\" For anyone who feels the need to \"help\" an overweight person, keep in mind that they are well aware of the problem. Reminding them of it just hurts.      Aiming For A Size 10 In New York\n \n Dear New York: Losing weight is the ultimate do-it-yourself project.  Congratulations and good luck to you, dear.\n It is this aspect of this form of deceptive advertising that is most objectionable. Those on the receiving end of such notes are all too often left feeling injured by a \"friend's\" heartlessly helpful gesture. Not all of us have the high-powered jobs we lust after, or a full head of hair, or a perfect size 8 figure. Advertising of this ilk preys upon damaged self image, and in the process damages it even further.

Those notes accused recipients of having violated the popular social networking site's terms of service (presumably by their having acted in an \"annoying or insulting\" manner toward others) and threatened them with the loss of their Facebook accounts if they failed to carry out the \"reconfirmation\" process those e-mails called for. Such messages were variously signed \"The Facebook Team\" or \"Facebook Security\" and contained links to web pages where the reconfirmation process was to be carried out. terms of service These demands should have set internal alarm bells clamoring in those who received them. Were a Facebook user deemed in violation of that entity's terms of service and in imminent risk of losing his account for having acted miserably toward others, Facebook wouldn't be looking to clear up the matter via having him enter his personal data onto forms; it would instead either be terminating his account or extracting from him a promise to henceforth use the service responsibly and according to its rules. Anyone whose fear of losing access to his social network account led him to comply with the e-mail's stated demands found himself greeted with this message on a Facebook look-alike page: \n\nWarning account disabled  Please review your recent activity to make sure no one is using your Facebook account without permission. Reviewing your activity just take a few moments. We'll start by asking you a couple of questions to confirm that this is your account.  Thank you for helping us in improving our level of security.\n That same page contained a form that asked for the user's e-mail address, password, Facebook security question and its answer, the first six digits of the user's credit card number, type of credit card, and country. Anyone who completed it was next taken to another that requested he \"confirm to your webmail\" by entering both its type and the password for his e-mail account. If that form was completed and clicked upon, yet another came up that required his user name, type of credit card, and the first six digits of that financial instrument. The rationale given at that point was \"For reasons of security and ownership of the account, sometimes we ask for additional verification before we allow you to get into facebook.\" In case that wasn't enough of a push, \"If you ignore this warning then our security system will block your account automatically.\" Those who completed the three forms were then taken to the real Facebook. It was all a scam, of course  the threatening missives were not from Facebook, and the frightened user was at no risk of losing his account. Internet security firm Sophos said, \"The emails are entirely bogus. They are not coming from Facebook. Social media venues would not request financial information, nor would they request login details.\" The purpose of the ruse is to collect credit card information and login information that those running the con can then use to carry out identity theft. (The real) Facebook says on its security page: security \n\nFake Notification Emails Spammers and scammers sometimes send phony emails that have been made to look like theyre from Facebook or another reputable website. These emails can be very convincing, and the \"From:\" field can even be spoofed to include \"Facebook\" or \"The Facebook Team.\" If an email looks strange, dont click on any of the links in it, and delete it from your inbox immediately. Be especially wary of emails that ask you to update your account, tell you to open an attachment, or warn you to take some other urgent action.\n Last updated:  2 December 2011\n    Times of India.  \"Facebook ScamThreatens to Delete Accounts.\"",

The Opportunity rover stopped communicating with Earth when a severe Mars-wide dust storm blanketed its location in June 2018. After more than a thousand commands to restore contact, engineers in the Space Flight Operations Facility at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) made their last attempt to revive Opportunity, to no avail. The solar-powered rover's final communication was received June 10. As the online world mourned the loss of the famous Martian explorer, many social media users started sharing a quote that supposedly constituted Oppy's final transmission to NASA: \"My battery is low and its getting dark.\"  This quote quickly made its way around the Internet, shared by celebrities, reporters, and social media influencers. Some people also created tributes to Opportunity that featured the rover's alleged final transmission: influencers   Although many individuals and news outlets cited these words as if they constituted a verbatim reproduction of Opportunity's final transmission, the phrase was not a literal reproduction of the robotic rover's last statement. news outlets The quote originated with a Twitter thread about Oppy's demise by posted by KPCC science reporter Jacob Margolis.

Deputy Project Scientist Abigail Fraeman spoke about what it was like when they realized the June [2018] dust storm was going to be particularly bad, and that Oppy's life was in danger. They told it to conserve energy. \"It's hard, because you know [the storm's] coming ... but there's nothing you can do to stop it,\" Fraeman said. \"By Thursday, we knew that it was bad. And then by Friday, we knew it was really bad, but there was nothing we could do but watch. And then it was Sunday, we actually got a communication from the rover and we were shocked,\" she said. \"It basically said we had no power left, and that was the last time we heard from it.\" John Callas, the project manager, offered another poignant detail about the final communication with Oppy: \"It also told us the skies were incredibly dark, to the point where no sunlight gets through. It's night time during the day.\" \"We were hopeful that the rover could ride it out. That the rover would hunker down, and then when the storm cleared, the rover would charge back up,\" he said. \"That didn't happen. At least it didn't tell us that it happened. So, we don't know.\"\n When NASA announced the completion of Opportunity's mission in February 2019, the Mars rover hadn't communicated with the space agency since the previous June. The solar-powered Opportunity was low on power when one of the largest dust storms observed on Mars engulfed the planet and, essentially, turned \"day into night,\" as the Planetary Society wrote:  communicated Planetary Society \nOn June 20th, NASA announced the storm had gone global. To be more accurate, it evolved into a planetary-encircling dust event (PEDE), lofting enough dust into the atmosphere to completely blanket the planet and block out the Sun. In other words, the Red Planet and most all its features were hidden from most orbiting instruments beneath an opaque, beige dust cloud. The atmospheric scientists taking measurements with instruments on the orbiters were soon blocked out.\n Oppy sent its final message from the surface of Mars on 10 June 2018: final message \nOpportunity downlinked what would turn out to be her final message from Mars on June 10, 2018. The bare bones contents of that missive informed her crew that a monster dust storm was lifting dust all around Endeavour Crater and was turning day into night there. Minutes later, the solar-powered robot field geologist presumably shut down and went into a kind of hibernation mode to wait out the storm. NASA attempted to communicate with Opportunity many times after the storm passed, but the rover never responded:  Margolis, Jacob.  \"How a Tweet About The Mars Rover Dying Blew Up on the Internet and Made People Cry.\"\r\n  The LAist.  16 February 2019.

However, they were mistaken that the helicopter crash that killed 30 Marines and a sailor had occurred \"yesterday\" or recently in January 2020. That incident actually took place in 2005, in Iraq. Here's a screenshot of the Navy news release about the 2005 helicopter crash: Navy news release   Readers may have noticed that this news release was published on Jan. 26, 2005. As the helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant happened on the 15th anniversary of the crash that killed 30 Marines, it's easy to see how some people may have misread this date.  Moreover, it seems that some news publications published recent stories that didn't clearly state that the military helicopter crash occurred 15 years ago.

        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Bodies still strapped into their airplane seats are discovered in an apartment near the World Trade Center. \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2001] \n\n\nIt seems that my friend's mother in law has a friend with an apartment in Battery Park City.  The friend was\njust allowed into her apartment the other day for the first time since September 11.  For\nthose who don't know lower Manhattan, Battery Park City is basically across the street from the World Trade Center.  This lady walks into her apartment and sees that her living room window is completely shattered.  And there, sitting in her living room, are two airplane seats, with two (dead and decomposing) people still strapped to them....I told my friend that those people are among the lucky ones - they can at least be identified and given a proper burial.    My friends wife is a flight attendant for american, a flight attendant friend of hers based out of NY told her that she was just allowed back to her apt. about two weeks ago, located a few blocks from WTC.  She was\nescorted to her apt. by a fireman for safety, when they opened the door they found two dead bodies still buckled into their seats, apparently from one of the airplanes.\n Origins:  The aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks was fraught with baseless rumors about grisly discoveries made at and near Ground Zero in   New York. A policeman dead of a self-inflicted bullet wound, his legs crushed in the rubble. (He'd chosen to die quickly rather than slowly.) A baby's broken body trampled on the street outside the World Trade Center. (The mother had earlier been seen fleeing the building with the babe in her arms, but the jostling of the panicked crowd caused the woman to drop the child, and it met its death underfoot.) A pair of clasped hands, severed at the wrists, one black and one white. Five emaciated bodies dug out of the debris sometime in November. (These folks had died of starvation.) The horror we felt (and still feel) found an outlet in those tales, so we passed them along. Each gruesome piece of scuttlebutt was an attempt to put into words our gropings towards a better understanding of the butchery that had taken place. Sixty-five dead on Flight 175 was beyond our comprehension  we understood the number, but could not take in the loss in terms of sixty-five individual tragedies. But one trampled baby we could understand, as we could one tragic policeman who put a gun to his head rather than wait for a rescue that would never come. Those mental images haunted us, but they also helped us put into context horror that existed on so grand a scale it would otherwise make little sense. The \"strapped in\" canard was yet another of these forays. We knew 65 passengers and crew perished aboard United Flight 175, 92 on American Airlines Flight 11, 44 on United Flight 93, and 64 on American Airlines Flight 77, yet without such a rumor, the grim reality of those 265 deaths would have remained lost in the numbers. Moldering bodies found harnessed to their seats in nearby apartments, though, brought it back into focus. These were real people who had died, and they hadn't died easily. The final half hour of their lives must have been terrifying. In mentally confronting the images of them being found sitting there, we were finally mentally confronting the reality of their deaths. Had such finds been made? No mention of them surfaced in any news accounts, and we have to believe such gruesome discoveries would not have gone unreported. In a world where the find of a\ncat and her kittens in the rubble of the World Trade Center sparks a frenzy of reportage, it's not reasonable to conclude that the discovery in a distant apartment of two of the murdered would have stayed out of the news. We do know this story was being circulated at an American Red Cross Service Center 2-10 in November when the person interviewed claimed others who worked with those returning to their apartments got it from some of the people they'd helped. But this is an \"I heard this from someone who heard it from someone else\" sighting, nothing  cat more. Curiously, in the days immediately following the September 11 attacks, mention did surface of a corpse or two found at the WTC site that did somewhat fit the rumor  some lengthy accounts of the carnage contained one-line passing references to the discovery of intact or partial remains strapped into what seemed to be airplane seats. Those references, however, were also presented in a \"someone told me about this\" way, not as something the reporter had himself seen or was vetting as coming from a named and reliable source who had witnessed the matter first-hand. Who had actually encountered those bodies or who those victims were remained a mystery, adding to the swirl of rumor. It's possible airplane seats and the remains of those who died on the two planes the WTC will eventually be recovered from Ground Zero. From that, it's logical to assume at least one of those seats will contain the full or partial body of a passenger, either one that was strapped in or one that fell in the same vicinity of that piece of wreckage that by happenstance came to reside in the seat. But that's a far cry from intact bodies being found in airplane seats blocks from the scene, as it is from those finds being made by luckless apartment dwellers weeks after the event. One would think the appearance of an entry hole\nblown into the side of a building (the corpses wouldn't have just materialized in someone's living room)\nwould have alerted those working the area to the need to investigate, but then rumor only rarely troubles itself with plausibility.

        ],
        "justification": "An ambitious effort by a group of African countries to tackle the effects of climate change and desertification has been in the works since 2007. The Great Green Wall (GGW) initiative plans to have trees extend like a belt across the Sahel region which is at the base of the Sahara, in order to prevent the expansion of the desert through climate change. since 2007 According to a meme shared with us by our readers, more than 20 African countries are a part of this effort, and the wall of trees, the meme says, will spread 7,000 km across the continent from coast to coast.      This meme is largely true, though the length of the GGW varies, as the project itself is far from being completed. According to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the project aims to restore Africas degraded landscapes and transform millions of lives in one of the worlds poorest regions, the Sahel. Once complete, the Wall will be the largest living structure on the planet  an 8,000 km natural wonder of the world stretching across the entire width of the continent. According The project aims to have the \"wall\" extend from Senegal in the west to Djibouti in the east, by 2030. The official website for the GGW details the reason for all their efforts: extend official website The catalyst for the Great Green Wall is the daily impact of desertification and climate change that is undermining the futures of millions of communities across Africa's Sahel region. Since the 1970s, the Sahel has been heavily affected by recurrent periods of drought. These droughts have threatened the livelihoods and future of entire populations across the region. The lack of rain has led to the disappearance of livestock and the destruction of cereal crops. The great famines that rocked the Sub-Saharan region in the 80s each affected millions of people. In addition, the high population growth rate is increasing demand for food and pressure to gain access to other natural resources which are the basis for livelihoods and the survival of the rural population. Millions of people  particularly rural youth  are currently facing an uncertain future due to the lack of decent rural jobs and continuous loss of livelihoods due to land degradation and falling yields. But according to The Associated Press, since the projects inception in 2007, millions of the planted trees have died due to diminishing rains and rising temperatures. Only 4% of the projects original goal has been met and around $43 billion dollars is needed to complete it. Given the challenges facing them, the focus of the project has also shifted from planting just a wall of trees to a mosaic of smaller and more durable projects that emphasize community-focused solutions that support agriculture and prevent desertification. Associated Press mosaic The GGW Accelerator, announced in January 2021, detailed these changes: GGW Accelerator The Great Green Wall Initiative has evolved from its initial focus on tree planting towards a comprehensive rural development initiative aiming to transform the lives of Sahelian populations by creating a mosaic of green and productive landscapes across 11 countries (Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti) .  Progress has been achieved into the second decade of the initiative, with almost 18 million hectares of degraded lands restored and 350.000 jobs created across the Sahel and the Great Green Wall countries.  The Accelerator also highlighted additional challenges they encountered in the process of creating the GGW which included insufficient coordination, exchange and flow of information at the regional and national level, weak organizational structures, and a lack of consideration in national environmental priorities. Accelerator Some of the changes include planting orchards and circular gardens where large trees strategically protect smaller ones. A number of these have been thriving in Senegals portion of the GGW.  include According to GGWs official website, there have been a number of successes. Senegal planted around 12 million drought resistant trees in less than a decade, while 5 million hectares of degraded land was restored in Nigeria, and 15 million hectares in Ethiopia. A November 2021 report in the Nature Sustainability journal assessed the economic impact of the program and concluded that it was economically worthwhile: website November 2021 The Great Green Wall programme is a colossal initiative to restore 100 million hectares of degraded ecosystems across 11 countries in the region [...] We evaluated the economic costs and benefits of future land restoration projects under this programme. We applied different scenarios that account for both market-priced and non-market benefits from restored ecosystems and consider the heterogeneity of local decision-making contexts in terms of investment planning horizons, discount rates, and the time needed for the restored ecosystems to start yielding their benefits in full. The results show that every US dollar invested into land restoration yields on average US$1.2 under the base scenario, ranging from US$1.1 to US$4.4 across the scenarios. At most, ten years are needed for land restoration activities to break even from the social perspective, accounting for both market-priced and non-market ecosystem benefits. To fund all proposed land restoration activities, an investment of US$44 billion is needed under the base scenario (US$1870 billion across scenarios).  The report added that Violent conflicts in the Sahel are estimated to reduce the accessibility to these degraded ecosystems from 27.9 million hectares to 14.1 million hectares.  While originally only 11 countries were a part of the effort, today there are more than 20 African nations involved.

According to numerous posts like this one, the essay was arguing for the destruction of national sovereignty and the establishment of a one world government.  one Some claimed that because of the headline, Biden supported a New World Order, which advocates for one world government. This stems from the New World Order (NWO) conspiracy theory, which claims that a secret group of global elites is seeking to establish an all-powerful, authoritarian, one-world government.  New World Order   The essay was indeed published by The Wall Street Journal on April 23, 1992. We found a copy in the archives of the New York Public Library. The full version can be seen below: New York Public Librar   Biden wrote the essay in response to a Wall Street Journal editorial that claimed he was in favor of neo-isolationism. To be clear, in Biden's essay, he was not talking about the NWO conspiracy theory. He argued that the Pentagons strategy of making America a Globocop would render it a hollow superpower.  The highlights made in the blog post above about his essay do not support the argument that Biden wants to destroy national sovereignty. In the article Biden argues for Americans to pull back on military intervention and build up economic might: Bristling with weapons, we would continue our economic decline, while rising industrial and financial giants in Europe and Asia viewed our military pretensions with indifference or contempt. The essay also addresses Americas role as a Globocop, arguing that Power also emanates from [...] the economic leverage to wield diplomatic clout, and not from the barrel of a gun. Biden argues in favor of multilateral military action by breathing life into the U.N. Charter. He envisions \"a permanent commitment of forces, for use by the Security Council. That means a presumption of collective action  but with a U.S. veto. He concluded: We must get lean militarily, revitalize American economic strength, and exercise a diplomatic leadership that puts new muscle into institutions of collective security.  The blog post makes another claim: that Biden wrote the WSJ article many years before writing the Patriot Act, a counterterrorism bill that increased surveillance capabilities by U.S. law enforcement after 9/11. This is partially true, because Biden did support the Patriot Act and claimed he was responsible for authoring earlier versions of counterterrorism legislation that featured prominently in it. Biden introduced and authored the Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995, which he argued provided one source of inspiration for the 2001 Patriot Act.  counterterrorism claimed In October 2001, he said in a Senate speech supporting the Patriot Act: It allows law enforcement to keep up with the modern technology these terrorists are using. The bill contains several provisions which are identical or nearly identical to those I previously proposed.  Senate speech The Patriot Act was criticized by civil rights advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who said it turned regular citizens into suspects, and resulted in a loss of privacy. While civil rights experts have criticized his support for the law, that criticism does not suggest that Biden is trying to build a one world government.  American Civil Liberties Union While the WSJ did publish this essay by Biden, the article did not make the arguments that critical blog posts on social media are claiming. As such, we rate this claim as False. Sources: Afghanistan: Last US Military Flight Departs Ending Americas Longest War.

General Eaton is a retired U.S. Army officer who commanded operations to train Iraqi troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003-04 before returning to the U.S. to become Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Training, United States Army Training and Doctrine Command, Fort Monroe, Virginia. That Eaton made the comment attributed to him above is documented by his verified Twitter account, where he posted that comment on the same day President Trump announced his intentions to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran deal: I have served with foreign Soldiers and armies all my professional life - including Iranian. The American Military word was trusted. I deeply regret @realDonaldTrump decision to walk away from the Iran Deal. He dishonors America and puts us and our allies at risk. #IranDeal @realDonaldTrump #IranDeal  Major General (ret) Paul Eaton (@PaulDEaton52) May 8, 2018 May 8, 2018  In a statement published on VoteVets.org, the major general provided additional opinion on the issue: statement Today, Donald Trump has moved us closer to a war with Iran, while he has also moved us closer to a nuclear war with North Korea. All this while we wage a war in Afghanistan. By decertifying the Iran deal, and putting the question of new sanctions before Congress, Iran will now consider restarting its nuclear program. Should Congress reinstitute sanctions, Iran will undoubtedly speed towards nuclear weapons, putting us on the path to war. If Congress inserts new triggers for sanctions, Iran will likely consider whether staying in the deal is worth it, at all. At the same time, North Korea now knows that any deal signed by the United States is not worth the ink it is written in, when it comes to Donald Trump. That chops diplomats off at the knees, as they struggle to find a non-military solution to the crisis in Korea. It moves us closer to nuclear war with North Korea. In short, today Donald Trump has put us on the path to two new wars, with nuclear weapons. We are very much less safe today, than we were yesterday. The path we are now on  massive loss of human life, on the scale of millions  is not a positive development for America, or humanity. We implore Congress to step in, and rein in this president.

Natural News listed several sources about whale deaths at the bottom of their article, but none of those sources mentioned radiation from Fukushima as likely or definitive cause. listed several sources bottom article Quotes from Ken Balcomb, executive director of the Center for Whale Research in Friday Harbor, Washington, were also misleadingly reproduced out of context by Natural News to bolster a claim that Balcomb's statement didn't support: The recent discovery of a carcass off the coast of British Columbia  that of a 19-year-old orca female, which was believed to be in the late stages of pregnancy, is just one example of the recent orca deaths that have scientists and conservationists worried. Ken Balcomb, executive director of the Center For Whale Research in Friday Harbor, Washington, said: Her death doesn't bode well for the southern resident population and certainly not for that matriline. Her mother died young. Her aunt had two sons and she's probably post-reproductive. She hasn't had any babies in the last 12 years. So there's no future. Balcomb also remarked: We haven't had any survivals in babies for a couple of years. We have had stillborns and newborns die and a number of whales that appear to be pregnant but didn't ultimately produce any calves. It's like zero survival in birth rate here. While Balcom did say that \"we haven't had any survivals in babies for a couple of years,\" he was talking about the local Puget Sound orca whale population only, and he didn't in any way connect a 100% infant orca mortality rate to radiation from Fukushima. His quotes originated with a story published by the Seattle Times in December 2014 about a baby orca whale that had died in the Pugent Sound, and while the exact cause of that whale's death was unclear, Balcolm suggested that the whale likely died due to a diminished food supply (and not radiation): suggested But two of the whales three biggest problems  the buildup of pollutants such as DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls in their blubber, and disturbance by marine traffic  appear to be worsened by a third, a reduction in available prey. These whales can eat sockeye and halibut, but overwhelmingly prefer fatty chinook from Puget Sound and Canadas Fraser River, distinguishing them from other fish by using sonar to sense differences in the animals swim bladders. And Puget Sound chinook numbers have dropped to about 10 percent of their historic high. They, too, are listed for protection under the ESA. For Balcomb, the loss of J32 suggests its time to consider drastic measures, such as a ban or steep curtailment in chinook fishing, even though fishing is likely the least of the threats chinook face. Its a wake-up call  we know what the problem is, whether its dams or fishing or habitat destruction, he said. Its just what happens when millions of people move into the watershed. (But) stopping fishing, at least for a while, is something we can do immediately. [...] The reality is, the basic problem is food, Balcomb said. Although apparently no baby orcas survived long after birth in Puget Sound in 2013 or 2014, that wasn't the case in the immediately following years, as 2015 saw nine successful orca births in Puget Sound: births In just over a year, Puget Sound has welcomed nine baby Southern-resident orcas to the fold, as the pod continues to rebound from 30-year-low numbers reported at the end of 2014. While radiation from the Fukushima disaster did have a major impact on marine life, the leak of radiactive material from the plant leak did not cause a proven \"100% infant mortality\" rate among orca whales.

        "justification": "In late 2019, readers asked us about blog posts that were widely shared on social media and falsely claimed that the reality television star Duane Chapman, known as \"Dog the Bounty Hunter,\" had died either by suicide or from a pulmonary embolism.  Those reports were false. Beginning on Nov. 20, admirers of Chapman and his late wife, Beth, who died in June after herself being the subject of death hoaxes, began posting tributes to him and sharing one of two blog posts.  hoaxes The first purported to be hosted by a website with the domain name whatnow.actual-events.com, but when internet users clicked on the story on social media, they were redirected to the domain newspanel.suzeraincollections.com. There, the story carried the headline \"Duane 'Dog' Chapman Died of Pulmonary Embolism. He Didn't Survive His Second Attack. He Was 66 -- WGN.\"  first   The highly dubious website falsely attributed the claim about Chapman's death to WGN America, a real U.S. television network that broadcast the Chapmans' most recent reality show \"Dog's Most Wanted.\" The hoax article also misleadingly used WGN America's logo in a sharebait video that purported to be a television news report about Chapman's death, but that paused after a few seconds and required users to share the article on social media in order to continue watching:   In reality, WGN America had no connection to the story and did not report on Chapman's death in November 2019, because Chapman did not die in November 2019. The specific claim that Chapman had died from a pulmonary embolism (a blocked artery in the lungs) was rather insidious. At first glance, it appeared especially plausible to many fans of the television star because he was in fact diagnosed with that very problem in September 2019. diagnosed The second blog post shared by social media users was even more distasteful than the first. It falsely and misleadingly used the logo of BBC News, a highly reputable and widely trusted information source, to report that Chapman had taken his own life.  In this instance, social media users shared an article that appeared to be hosted on the domain bbc-newsroom.actualeventstv.com, but which redirected to news-room.easystepsdiy.info. On social media, the post carried the headline \"Duane 'Dog' Chapman Died of Suicide After Depression Attack on His Sickness -- BBC News\" but when users redirected to the source, the article's headline proclaimed: shared proclaimed \"Breaking: (Actual Suicide Video) Duane 'Dog' Chapman Died of Suicide After Depression Attack on His Sickness -- BBC News.\" Despite the extremely distasteful claim that the video in the article contained footage of Chapman's suicide, it contained nothing of the sort and, just as in the first article, the video stopped after a second or two and required viewers to share the post on social media in order to continue watching.     The claim that Chapman had taken his own life was, like the claim he had died of a pulmonary embolism, particularly insidious. In the season finale of \"Dog's Most Wanted,\" broadcast by WGN America on Nov. 6, Chapman spoke about the recent death of his wife from cancer, and the considerable difficulty he was experiencing in coping with her loss.  At one moment in the episode, he reportedly discussed how he had contemplated taking his own life, such was his grief. People magazine quoted Chapman as saying: People \"I just hope that I dont live very much longer without her, because now she made the first step, shes through the gate,\" he added. She paved a way for me. I want to take a [god damn] pain pill so bad. I feel like if I did something to myself right now and passed away suicidal and I got to heaven and was like, Hi honey, and would she go, You [dumb ass], why would you do that? Or would she go, Wow, youre here. Ill be like Of course Im here. You left me. Im here. So, am I obligated to do that?  Because of that widely reported revelation, a report that Chapman had died by suicide would have appeared somewhat plausible to many readers.  The dubious nature of the websites involved, and the absence of any corroborating evidence or reports by actual news organizations, meant that some readers would have immediately recognized the stories as hoaxes. However, a significant number were taken in by them, and shared them on social media, to the extent that Chapman himself intervened. He provided the gossip website TMZ a photograph of himself holding the Nov. 19 edition of the Denver Post, and a handwritten sign that read \"I'm alive!\" Chapman then posted a screenshot of that article to his own Instagram page the next day. photograph Instagram If you need help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255.

        ],
        "justification": "When we human folk exchange information about each other, age is one of the most important pieces of data we pass along.  Knowing someone's age immediately allows us to infer a great deal of information about that person with a reasonable degree of certainty: Age not only tells us whether someone is a child, an adult, or an elderly person, but it allows us to place people into much finer gradations of categories  infant, toddler, child, adolescent, young adult, adult, middle-aged, elderly  from which we can deduce a good deal about their physical, psychological, and social statuses.   We know a 4-year-old child should be walking, but a 6-month-old baby is unlikely to be capable of the feat.  We understand a couple of 16-year-olds might well have a baby together, but an 8-year-old boy is generally too young to father one and a 58-year-old woman is usually too old to conceive one.  We're aware most 9-year-olds haven't yet reached puberty, but a 39-year-old might well have started experiencing many of the infirmities of advanced age (e.g., lessened eyesight, loss of hearing, weight gain, persistent aches and pains).  We grasp that a 29-year-old is in what we would term \"the prime of life,\" while an 89-year-old has well exceeded the average human lifespan.  We can make pretty good guesses from a person's age about whether he's old enough to have finished his schooling, live away from his parents, be married, or hold an important professional position, or whether he's too old to still be working or raising children of his own.  And even those of us who still have most of our lives ahead of us know all this. When it comes to our pets, however, many of us are mystified how to relate their ages to ours.  Sure, knowledgeable owners and breeders may be quite familiar with all the developmental stages of their chosen animals, but many of us casual pet owners can't do much more than distinguish between \"puppy,\" \"dog,\" and \"old dog.\"  At what age are kittens weaned from their mothers?  What's the average lifespan of a dog?  When is a cat old enough to reproduce, and when is a dog too old to bear a litter?   Is an 8-year-old dog in the prime of life, or is he closer to middle age? Lacking a good deal of observational experience, many of us simply don't know. Since knowledge and experience take time and effort to acquire, we've developed simple shortcuts to help us answer these questions, such as the well-known formula for \"dog years\": multiply your dog's age by seven, and you'll have his equivalent age in human terms.  Although this formula might work roughly well for the middle years of a dog's life, it's too simplistic to accurately reflect a dog's developmental status closer to either end of its lifespan.  Using this calculation, for example, an 18-month-old dog would be at a developmental stage similar to a 10-year-old child's, but while many 18-month-old dogs are fully grown and capable of reproducing, few 10-year-old children are.  The \"dog years\" measurement tells us a 15-year-old dog is supposed to be the equivalent of a 105-year-old person, but (factoring out accidents and other unnatural causes of death) a much larger proportion of dogs live to the age of 15 than humans live to the age of 105.  As well, age is more than just a chronological measurement of years lived; it's also an expression of how our bodies have been affected by the passage of time.  Different types of animals age at different rates, so we can't employ a simple, direct, proportional relationship to correlate the ages of species as disparate as dogs and humans, especially since variable factors such as genetics, nutrition, and environment play an important role in the aging process. The bottom line is just as we wouldn't raise a litter of puppies or kittens the same way we'd raise a baby, neither should we care for our pets based on how old we think they'd be if they were people.  For those who would like a rough idea of how the ages of our canine and feline friends compare to ours (strictly for entertainment purposes), we present the following charts courtesy of ANTECH:   ANTECH \n\nDog Human\n1 year 15 years\n2 years 24 years\n4 years 32 years\n7 years 45 years\n10 years 56 years\n15 years 76 years\n20 years 98 years\n     \n\n\n\n\nCat Human\n1 year 15 years\n2 years 24 years\n5 years 36 years\n7 years 45 years\n12 years 64 years\n15 years 76 years\n18 years 88 years\n21 years 100 years\n\n\n However, smaller dog breeds tend to live longer on average than larger breeds, so no single chart can adequately represent all dogs with much accuracy.

        "justification": "It sounds like something from a horror flick. A small, parasitic creature swims into the mouth of a fish and attaches itself to the organisms tongue  yes, fish have tongues  causing it to slowly degrade before latching onto the stub leftover, thus becoming a parasitic pseudo tongue. Over time, the host loses its ability to eat and slowly succumbs to starvation.   So claims a now-viral Instagram post that was shared in March 2021 by the Smithsonian Institute in appreciation of #ParasiteWeek2021. And if the photo was enough to give you the heebie-jeebies, then you may not want to continue reading. Because both the photograph in question and the supposed parasite featured in it are, in fact, real. The picture featured an organism known as a cymothoid isopod and was originally shared on Aug. 3, 2020, by marine biologist Jimmy Bernot, a post-doctoral scholar with the National Science Foundation and Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History specializing in crustacean phylogeny and parasite evolution. In an email to Snopes, Bernot said that he captured the photo during a 2016 survey of fish parasites of Moreton Bay, Australia.   The host fish is known scientifically as Mugil cephalus or the Flathead mullet.  \"Not to be confused with the business in the front, party in the back haircut,\" said Bernot.  And the parasite seen inside the mullet's mouth is what is known as a cymothoid isopod that measured about an inch long. According to the scientist, it appeared that the fish did use the creepy-crawly as a \"pseudo tongue.\"  The fact that you can see imprints of the fish's teeth on the back of the isopod indicates the fish is crushing items against the isopod similar to how the fish would use its tongue, he said.  Jimmy Bernot  Isopods are marine invertebrates, or animals without backbones, that belong to a greater group of animals called crustaceans. Only a handful of the at least 95 known families of isopods are parasitic, one of which being cymothoid, according to research published in a 2014 issue of the International Journal for Parasitology: Parasites and Wildlife. The cymothoidae family in particular is made up of 350 species of aquatic parasitic isopods. Widely distributed around the world in both oceanic and freshwater habitats, cymothoids are on the larger side of parasites and can reach lengths upwards of a quarter of an inch, with the largest reaching lengths of up to 3 inches. International Journal for Parasitology: Parasites and Wildlife \"Cymothoids superficially look like free-living isopods, such as terrestrial rolly-pollies or pillbugs that people may be familiar with, except for their powerful hooked legs that they use to attach to their host,\" explained Bernot. \"As adults, they are not good swimmers and typically stay permanently attached to their host.\" Equipped with a long, slender body that tapers at the end and sharply curved hooks at the end of its limbs, the cymothoid can attach to its host fish at the gills or mouth as well as externally or inside the host flesh, depending on the species. Cymothoids are generally host-specific, meaning each cymothoid typically attaches to a single host species or a small group of related fish. On a parasitized fish, Bernot said that there will often be a single large female and a few small males attached nearby on the same fish.  Various types of parasitic attachment strategies of cymothoid isopods. International Journal for Parasitology: Parasites and Wildlife  International Journal for Parasitology: Parasites and Wildlife   Only a few species attach specifically to the tongue, and these are commonly called \"tongue-biters.\" Other species attach to the skin or gills, but all have detrimental effects on their hosts including blood loss due to the parasite feeding, skin and tissue damage, deformities, and overall stunted growth and reproductive issues.  And when it comes to the cymothoid featured on social media posts, the Smithsonian Institute wrote that the crustaceans sever the host fishs tongue\"  a claim that is only partly true. wrote \"The cymothoids feed on blood and perhaps some of the tongue and surrounding tissue in the host's mouth, but the loss and degradation of the tongue are at least partially, if not mostly, due to atrophy of the tongue from mechanical damage caused by the strong, hooked legs that the isopod uses to attach to the base of the tongue,\" said Bernot. In short, cymothoids do not snip straight through the tongue of the fish, but rather cause such damage that a portion of the tongue can eventually fall off.  And according to the research institution, Bernot's photograph is the only known instance in the animal kingdom where a parasite has been observed as fully replacing its hosts organ. In a reply to his original post, Bernot said that the pictured cymothoid isopod holding caused its host to atrophy  a fancy word for wasting away. Studying parasites like cymothoids helps researchers to better understand evolutionary biology and the unique adaptations that individual species obtain in order to survive.  \"It appears different groups of parasitic isopods have independently evolved strongly clawed legs through a process called convergent evolution,\" said Bernot. \"Convergent evolution is of interest to evolutionary biologists and developmental biologists since it gives us insights into how evolution can shape the morphology of animals.\"  And cymothoids also impact human health and economies because of their effect on fish, which Bernot said could sometimes infect more than 90% of fish on a single farm, including commercially farmed sea bass, bream, and salmon. As gross as it may sound, eating a fish with a parasite is \"definitely still safe for humans,\" but the fish might be smaller or have scars, and Bernot said that means it can't be sold at its highest market value.",

According to The Associated Press, online data published by Chinas three largest cellphone carriers indicated that for January and February 2020, China Mobile Ltd. reported a drop of nearly 7.25 million subscribers, while China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. lost 7.8 million subscribers and China Telecom Corp. lost 5.6 million in February alone. published figures As of April 2020, China had reported a total of about 81,000 COVID-19 cases and about 3,300 deaths from the disease.

American intelligence agencies have concluded that the Chinese government itself does not know the extent of the virus and is as blind as the rest of the world. Midlevel bureaucrats in the city of Wuhan, where the virus originated, and elsewhere in China have been lying about infection rates, testing and death counts, fearful that if they report numbers that are too high they will be punished, lose their position or worse, current and former intelligence officials said. Bureaucratic misreporting is a chronic problem for any government, but it has grown worse in China as the Communist leadership has taken a more authoritarian turn in recent years under Mr. Xi. The Times reported again the following day that Chinese officials appeared to be pushing for quick burials of the dead and suppressing online discussion of fatalities in order to head off public opprobrium over the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak: following day For months, the residents of Wuhan had been told they could not pick up the ashes of their loved ones who had died during the height of Chinas coronavirus outbreak. Now that the authorities say the epidemic is under control, officials are pushing the relatives to bury the dead quickly and quietly, and they are suppressing online discussion of fatalities as doubts emerge about the true size of the toll. Chinas official death toll from the coronavirus stood at 3,322 on [April 3], but medical workers and others have suggested the count should be higher ... As China tries to control the narrative, the police in Wuhan, where the pandemic began, have been dispatched to break up groups on WeChat, a popular messaging app, set up by the relatives of coronavirus victims. Government censors have scrubbed images circulating on social media showing relatives in the city lining up at funeral homes to collect ashes. Officials have assigned minders to relatives to follow them as they pick burial plots, claim their loved ones remains and bury them, grieving family members say. The ruling Communist Party says it is trying to prevent large gatherings from causing a new outbreak. But its tight controls appear to be part of a concerted attempt to avoid an outpouring of anguish and anger that could be a visceral reminder of its early missteps and efforts to conceal the outbreak. Those same public displays or discussions of loss could also feed skepticism over how China has counted the dead. Still, to believe that the drop in cellphone subscriptions experienced by Chinese carriers corresponds directly to unreported coronavirus deaths, one would have to believe that the Chinese government managed to misreport COVID-19 mortality in that country by a factor of about 7,000 ... and then let the cat out of the bag by openly publishing statistics about cellphone usage that revealed those unreported deaths. Perhaps some correlation exists, but as The Associated Press reported, the drop in cellphone subscriptions in China could also be attributable to reasons other than millions of subscribers' succumbing to COVID-19: reported A representative with China Mobile Ltd. said while the situation was related to the COVID-19 outbreak, it was not related to deaths, but changes in lifestyle. It was mainly due to reduced business and social activities resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, a spokesperson with the company confirmed to the AP. Many customers in China have multiple SIM cards and it is common that they use their non-primary SIM cards to do these activities.

        "justification": "It's not every day that readers see a paid online advertisement that describes the cumulative weight of someone's bowel movements. One such ad for the FloraSpring weight loss supplement reads as follows: \"65 y/o Man Poops Out 42 Lbs.\" A somewhat similar YouTube video ad also promised a \"pooping habit\" for customers who take FloraSpring. First, this is the Google-hosted ad that claimed a 65-year-old man had 42 pounds of bowel movements:   However, the photo in the misleading ad did not show a man who \"pooped out 42 pounds\" (nor was he actually 65 years old). It was originally posted by photographer Pavel Ladziak in 2017. posted   In 2017, Bodybuilding.com reported that Ladziak was nowhere near 65 years of age: reported \"Pawel Ladziak, a 35-year-old Polish fitness pro and personal trainer, is causing a sensation on Instagram by intentionally aging himself. His goal: to look as muscular and as old as he possibly can.\" There was no indication that Ladziak had any involvement with or knowledge of the \"Man Poops\" ad. We reached out to him, and will update this story should we hear back. The misleading ad led to a full-screen seminar-style video on a website for FloraSpring. It was described as \"a weight loss supplement that assists in the weight loss process by increasing ones metabolism.\" described At first, a red line at the bottom of the screen looked to be a progress bar for the video player. However, the line appeared to be part of the video itself. It moved at a fairly quick speed at the beginning of the video, giving the effect that its running time would be short (as promised in the ad). However, the line later slowed to a crawl for the remainder of the presentation. Around 80 seconds into the video, the video's voice-over announced: \"In the next 6 minutes and 27 seconds, you're going to get to go behind the scenes at Dr. (Steven) Masley's private clinic.\" However, the video lasted well over 45 minutes. Viewers who attempted to leave the video page were shown a notice. It said: \"WAIT! BEFORE YOU GO... READ THE FREE REPORT FROM DR. MASLEY INSTEAD OF WATCHING THIS VIDEO NOW... CLICK HERE NOW.\" It led to a fairly lengthy page with an introduction from Dr. Steven Masley, MD. page The page purported to feature success stories for FloraSpring. The pictures next to the stories were from unrelated websites. For example, one of the pictures was from a YouTube video that featured dancing. Another looked to have come from the satirical website ClickHole. pictures YouTube video ClickHole We contacted Revival Point LLC, the company that sells FloraSpring. We asked about the ad that claimed a 65-year-old man released 42 pounds of fecal matter. The company's name was \"Revival Point Labs\" in the ad. A company spokesperson claimed that an affiliate was to blame. They also said the ad was a violation of the company's terms of service: This advertisement is not run by Dr. Masley or Revival Point LLC. The man in the photo does not represent a Revival Point LLC customer and the ad copy does not represent any of the studies supporting the ingredients in the product. The spokesperson later said they \"submitted the link to Google Adwords to get the ad account removed that's running the ads.\" They also told us that they \"terminated the link from these ads and permanently removed the affiliate.\" We asked about the unrelated photographs in the success stories. They told us that the three stories were representative of Masley's patients, but that real names and photos were changed for privacy reasons: unrelated photographs As for the photos on the longer page, these people represent three of Dr. Masley's patients, but their names and photos have been changed to keep their identity private. Due to Doctor/Patient confidentiality, we cannot provide any further information on these patients or their medical history with Dr. Masley. The photos on the page have been replaced with licensed stock imagery. Following our email to Revival Point LLC, the original pictures were changed to stock photographs. original pictures stock photographs We also stumbled upon a YouTube video that purported to show a FloraSpring video advertisement about a \"pooping habit.\" Masley appeared in the video, which looked to have been screen-recorded and posted by a YouTube user. The ad mentioned \"poop\" and \"pooping\" many times. The small, corner photograph of Masley matched the profile picture on a YouTube channel for Revival Point Labs. YouTube video YouTube channel  The ad's voice-over script promised a \"pooping habit\" with FloraSpring: The good news is this pooping habit is something that anyone can start at any time at any age. It will help burn off pounds of fat, restore energy, shut down cravings, and yes, help you have amazing poops. Poop more often. Poop better. Make your poops more solid, and yet come out much easier, all while flushing out pounds of fat, flushing those excess calories and fat right out your butt into your toilet, and right down the drain, gone for good. We asked Revival Point LLC about the FloraSpring \"pooping habit\" ad. In response, they said: \"This does not appear to be from us or affiliated with us.\" In sum, a picture in an online advertisement did not show a 65-year-old man. He also did not \"poop out 42 pounds\" after taking FloraSpring. The man in the ad is Ladzia, a Polish photographer. He's in his late 30s, and ages himself to look older as a hobby. Revival Point LLC claimed that the Google ad and the \"pooping habit\" YouTube video ad were not created by their company.",

        "justification": "Claim:  The film The Manchurian Candidate was withdrawn from distribution due to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.   \nStatus:  False.\n Examples:   \n\n\n[Lim,  2008] A satirical vision of the Cold War as hallucinatory nightmare, [The Manchurian Candidate] opened during the Cuban Missile Crisis and seemed not only to distill the anxieties of the day but also eventually to foreshadow the political assassinations of the decade. United Artists and the film's star, Frank Sinatra, a friend of John F. Kennedy, pulled it from circulation after the president's death, and its long absence from movie screens  it finally resurfaced in the late '80s  only enhanced its mystique.  [filmsite.org,  2000] [The Manchurian Candidate's] importance as an un-nervingly close-to-the-truth statement was underlined when it was withdrawn and suppressed from movie theaters after the death of President Kennedy one year later  JFK was allegedly gunned down by the hand of a suspected, robotically-docile, trained and 'brain-washed' assassin.\n Origins:  In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, a number of films, television shows, advertisements, and other media that included images of the World Trade Center were altered to remove any glimpses of the Twin Towers.  Particularly for the first several months after 9/11, when even unrelated images that were only vaguely reminiscent of that tragic day were criticized for capitalizing on disaster, the wound inflicted on that awful day was still far too raw to risk additional hurt by resuming business as usual.  criticized A similar phenomenon has been linked to the film The Manchurian Candidate, John Frankenheimer's 1962 Cold War thriller about a U.S. soldier who is abducted during the Korean War and spirited away to Manchuria, where his Communist captors brainwash him before allowing him to return to the United States to unwittingly serve them as a political assassin.  Legend has it that when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas a year after the movie's original release, and rumors were swirling that his murder might have been part of a Communist conspiracy, Frank Sinatra (whose company produced The Manchurian Candidate) hastily withdrew the film from distribution and then suppressed it for twenty-five years because (pick one or more of the following): \n It was too eerily reminiscent of the real-life political assassination that had just shocked and horrified America.  It was thought to have been the inspiration behind Lee Harvey Oswald's shooting of President Kennedy.  It was considered too dangerous as a potential blueprint for a real-life assassination plot.\n Whatever  people may have thought about a possible link between The Manchurian Candidate and the JFK assassination at the time, however, the film was not withdrawn from distribution at the end of 1963, nor was its later unavailability due to any connection with the events in Dallas. The Manchurian Candidate did seemingly \"disappear\" for a few years around the time of the Kennedy assassination, not because it had been \"suppressed\" but simply because its original theatrical run had largely played out by then (it had already been in release for a year), and  as was typical in that day  a couple of years elapsed before it was leased by its distributor (United Artists) to network television and scheduled for broadcast.  The film was broadcast by CBS in 1965 and 1966, and again by NBC at least twice in the 1970s. 1965 The Manchurian Candidate was withdrawn from distribution by Frank Sinatra in 1972 (a state in which it remained for the next fifteen years), but that act was a business decision that had nothing to do with political events.  Michael Schlesinger, the man responsible for the film's eventual re-release by MGM/UA Classics in 1988, explained in a 2008 letter to the Los Angeles Times why the movie had gone unseen for a fifteen-year period: \n\nBy late 1963, the film had simply played out. The original [distribution] deal was for 10 years, and it was, to put it charitably, not a very good one. When the time came to renew in 1972, Sinatra's attorneys opted to take the movie back and bury their \"mistake\" [of having accepted the original deal]. And so it remained \"lost\" until 1987, when the New York Film Festival requested it for its 25th anniversary. By then, Sinatra had new attorneys with no ax to grind and they consented [to release the film]. The reaction was so overwhelming that MGM/UA immediately struck a new  and much fairer  deal to reacquire the rights. We opened the film in February 1988 to fabulous reviews and tremendous business, and it has stayed available for theaters, TV and home entertainment ever since. But it was never \"withdrawn\" prior to 1972.\n A 1988 New York Times article about the (surprisingly successful) theatrical re-release of The Manchurian Candidate provided a little more background about the economic issues that led to the film's temporary withdrawal: \n\nAccording to Mr. Frankenheimer, the movie was listed on the studio's books at such a loss that any sales would profit the studio but not Mr. Sinatra, Mr. Axelrod and Mr. Frankenheimer, who were partners in the film. \"There was no reason to enrich the coffers of U.A.,\" said Mr. Axelrod. So Mr. Sinatra, who shared control with the studio, blocked any use of the movie, Mr. Axelrod said. There is a common misperception that \"The Manchurian Candidate\" was withdrawn because of the assassination of President Kennedy. But the President was killed a year after the movie failed to make a dent at the box office. Later it was seen briefly on television.\n Suddenly, a film made several years before The Manchurian Candidate which also starred Frank Sinatra and involved a political assassination plot, was withdrawn from some local television airings at one time due to associations with the Kennedy assassination: Suddenly \n\nSinatra is outstanding as the disgruntled war vet who hopes to become a \"somebody\" by killing the president. The parallels between his character and Lee Harvey Oswald's are too close for comfort, so much so that Suddenly was withdrawn from local TV packages for several years after the JFK assassination. Sinatra would claim in later years that he himself engineered the removal of Suddenly from general distribution, though in fact he'd lost whatever rights he'd held on the film when it lapsed into public domain.\n\n Last updated:  25 February 2008\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   Harmetz, Aljean.  \"'Manchurian Candidate,' Old Failure, Is Now a Hit.\"\n   The New York Times.  24 February 1988.

            "A meme provided some factual information, but also excluded many complexities in telling the story of a crash that left a 1-year-old dead."
        ],
        "justification": "On October 12, 2017 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a Nissan SUV carrying four adults and four children was making a left turn onto Florline Boulevard at a green light when a Corvette driven by a speeding off-duty police officer traveling at an estimated 94 MPH in a 50 MPH zone smashed into its passenger side, killing a 1-year-old girl who was ejected from the SUV. As noted in a meme circulated on social media in the aftermath of the accident, the officer behind the wheel of the Corvette, Christopher Manuel, was not penalized (even though he was driving nearly double the speed limit), while the dead girl's mother (who was a passenger in and not the driver of the SUV), 21-year-old Brittany Stephens, was charged with negligent homicide for not properly securing the child in a car seat:  As is often the case, while the meme provided factual information, it also ignored the many complexities of this case and instead focused on a single, outrage-inducing aspect of it. The primary context omitted here is that both Manuel and Stephens were initially arrested on suspicion of negligent homicide, but prosecutors -- who deliberated for two years -- ultimately felt they could not determine who was more at fault for the child's death, nor could they meet the burden of proof needed to successfully bring criminal charges against Manuel. In the end, they took no action against either party. The crash occurred when the driver of the SUV turned left onto Florline Boulevard while Manuel was traveling northbound on Airline Highway. According to Manuel's arrest report, investigators estimated his vehicle's speed at the time of the accident at 94 MPH based on calculations from data recorded by his car's airbag control module. Both cars had green lights, so the primary issue was determining whether the SUV's driver failed to yield, or whether the Corvette's excessive speed would have made it extremely difficult or impossible for the driver to safely judge the turn. Investigators came down on the side of the latter, and Manuel filed a civil suit alleging that the driver of the SUV was at fault for turning \"suddenly and without warning\" into his lane. Additional complicating factors were that the driver of the SUV was unlicensed, the vehicle was carrying too many occupants, and no one in the SUV was wearing a seatbelt. Police also stated that Stephens did not properly secure her daughter's car seat, instead placing it on the SUV's center console between the two front seats, which is considered an act of \"gross negligence\" that was a \"contributing factor in the death\" of the child. gross negligence As the Baton Rouge Advocate reported, the district attorney felt his office could not fairly determine whom, if anyone, to prosecute: reported East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore III said his office decided not to bring charges against either Manuel or Stephens, reasoning that both had contributed to the tragic outcome even though \"one suffered a bigger loss.\" \"It becomes a conundrum of 'Who's at fault?'\" Moore said. \"Do you really want to charge the mom with her child's death? Of course not. Which act truly caused the death, speeding or lack of proper restraint? Is one more culpable than the other? We couldn't really determine that based on the facts of the case and what the law requires.\" This is a trying decision, Moore said. It weighed on me as a parent with children. One aspect of the controversy surrounding the crash was Manuel's status as a member of the Baton Rouge Police Department, which some critics maintained may have influenced the DA's decision not to prosecute a criminal case against him. Another was that no one involved in the accident was even cited: [Marcus Allen, an attorney] volunteered to represent Stephens for free after news of her case went viral within some circles online. He said Moore's \"unilateral decision\" not to prosecute \"has the look of impropriety\" because the case involves a law enforcement officer and argued prosecutors could have avoided that by going forward with the case and allowing the criminal justice system to decide the officer's fate. Police recommended citations for several other people in the SUV with Stephens after finding various safety issues, including that there were too many occupants, none were wearing seatbelts and the driver was unlicensed. Prosecutors had two years to issue those citations but instead let the tickets expire without doing so. They did the same for a misdemeanor speeding count against Manuel, which also expired. Moore said prosecuting Manuel for speeding would have meant essentially forfeiting the option to charge him with negligent homicide because of double jeopardy laws at the time. But once prosecutors ruled out the more serious charge, they could have chosen to issue the speeding ticket then with no major impacts on the case. [Allen] said that's the least Moore's office could have done. \"How can you overlook the glaring fact that he was going almost 100 mph?\" Allen said. \"You just cannot operate a vehicle that fast. For him to walk away from this with no criminal charges ... it almost appears he's above the law.\" Although prosecutors decided to take no action in the case, some online reports nonetheless mistakenly reported that Brittany Stephens had been convicted and sentenced to prison. reported Skene, Lea.  \"Baton Rouge Police: Car Seat Placed on Center Console During Crash Involving Off-Duty Cop That Killed Baby.\"\r\n  The [Baton Rouge] Advocate.  1 March 2018.

INTERPOL, as well, issued an Orange Notice alerting law enforcement to \"potential criminal activity in relation to the falsification, theft and illegal advertising of COVID-19 and flu vaccines.\" approved warn Orange Notice One area where these scams have reportedly proliferated is the so-called dark web. Broadly speaking, the dark web refers to unindexed content on the internet that can not be searched for and that, among other things, contains several anonymous marketplaces and forums that purport to sell a wide range of illicit material. On Feb. 8, 2021, CBS News reported that \"in just the last six weeks, the number of vaccine ads on the dark web has exploded,\" adding that \"the asking prices have doubled or even quadrupled.\" reportedly refers reported For a Dec. 25, 2020, segment on PlanetMoney, NPR spoke to Chad Anderson, a senior security researcher at the cyberthreat intelligence agency Domain Tools. \"We're a cyberthreat intelligence data company,\" he explained, \"so we scan the entire Internet as many times as we can every single day and give insights to customers based upon what we see.\" Back then, he argued the vaccine ads popping up on the dark web were clearly scams. NPR Chad Anderson \"For one thing,\" NPR correspondent Stacey Vanek Smith explained, \"the Pfizer vaccine requires a very intense cold storage chain. The vaccines have to be kept at negative 70 degrees Fahrenheit.\" And also, she added, \"the COVID vaccine ads are mixed in with ads for all kinds of other things, and Chad says that tends to be a red flag.\" At the time of this reporting, the only two FDA-approved vaccines are the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine. Both shots are mRNA vaccines, and as such they both require this high level of refrigeration for transport. explained Snopes reached out to Anderson to ask if ads for vaccines on dark web marketplaces still appeared to be scams, as of February 2021. \"Just went and took a look at the last of the 'reputable' markets [on the dark web] and I still don't see any COVID vaccines for sale on there,\" he wrote to us by email, adding that he did see some ads for the largely discredited treatment hydroxychloroquine, but not much else on the COVID-19 front. One problem with the dark web, however, is that there is no requirement for \"reputable behavior\" and few safeguards against predatory behavior. Several media reports have cited a dark web market named Agartha as having ads for COVID-19 vaccines. Indeed it does  several hundred of them, according to a recent analysis by Snopes  but these ads are all comically obvious frauds. One ad listed under \"opiates,\" for instance, asked for \"mutual trust\" in its effort to sell some \"Moderona\" vaccine: media reports   Other ads claim to be able to ship the Pfizer vaccine, which as a reminder requires extreme refrigeration for storage, by FedEx at no additional cost. Many ads, like the one below, don't even specify what vaccine product they purport to sell. Instead, the ad appears to be a bait-and-switch for a seller peddling other drugs ranging from marijuana to fentanyl:   According to DomainTools' Anderson, \"Agartha is considered an entire scam market.\" He added that \"I've never thrown money into my user wallet on there, but I have heard from others that the moment you do it's immediately siphoned off to another wallet that I would assume is the wallet of those running the site.\" CBS News, in its reporting, cited the work of cybersecurity company Check Point. That firm attempted to purchase COVID-19 vaccines from various dark web sellers, even sending a Bitcoin payment to one. \"A few days after the Bitcoin transaction, Check Point received a message from the vendor saying the vaccine had been shipped, CBS reported. \"Then a few days later, that vendor's account completely disappeared from the site.\" They never received any product in return, and the firm concluded that none of the sellers they found actually had any vaccine to sell.  reported Overt fraud aside, a possibility remains that as more easily transportable vaccines are approved and produced, a dark web black market for vaccines could develop. \"As time goes by, and more people get access to legitimate doses, there's always the possibility that some of that real product could make its way onto the dark web,\" CBS reported. \"More providers will lead to looser shipping restrictions,\" Anderson agreed. reported The risks from engaging in these transactions are multifaceted. Outside of a potential loss of money, there are risks of receiving unknown and dangerous drugs instead of a vaccine or having identifying information stolen. \"In addition to the dangers of ordering potentially life-threatening products,\" a December 2020 Interpol news release stated, \"an analysis by the INTERPOLs Cybercrime Unit revealed that of 3,000 websites associated with online pharmacies suspected of selling illicit medicines and medical devices, around 1,700 contained cyber threats, especially phishing and spamming malware.\" In other words, even if these listings were not overt scams, it's not worth the risk. stated Because at this time there are several ads for COVID-19 vaccines on various dark web markets of low repute, but that none of them appear to be legitimate, we rate the claim that the vaccines are for sale as \"Mostly False.\"",

Many tweets and Facebook comments indicated users were unfamiliar with Muslim Family Day, its scope, or its purpose. According to the event's web site, the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA) began organizing Muslim Family Day outings across the United States in 2000: web site This event was first held at Six Flags Great Adventure, NJ, in September 2000. The event was immediately a huge success. The tragic events of 9/11 that resulted in the loss of thousands of innocent lives, also affected this event directly. The chief organizer, Tariq Amanullah, who worked on the 96th floor of WTC, Tower 2, passed away. The team was unable to come together again till year 2004, when the event came back bigger than ever before. In 2015, ICNA organized at least two Muslim Family Day events at Six Flags theme parks. On 14 September 2015, Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey, was reserved for the event, as shown by a flyer available on the park's web site: Great Adventure flyer The 11 October 2015 Muslim Family Day at Six Flags Over Georgia was listed on the park's web site along with several other separate private events held there, such as \"Math and Science Day,\" \"Physics Day,\" \"Relay for Life American Cancer Society Luminara Ceremony,\" and the \"Scream Out Loud LGBT Pride Party\": Muslim Family Day listed Six Flags Over Georgia will host Muslim Friends and Family Day, a private event in the Picnic Pavilions, presented by ICNA, Sunday, October 11, 2015. During this private event, Muslims and their friends, families, and all guests will be able to enjoy Halal foods, open-air bazaars featuring Muslim merchants, congressional prayers, informative lectures, our thrilling roller coasters and a stream of Islamic nasheed.

Among rumors circulating on social media were claims that Six Flags locations were \"closed\" to non-Muslims on Muslim Family Day events, or that Christians were denied permission to organize similar events: denied WTF is this??! #SixFlagsBaltimore CLOSED TODAY TO ALL NON MUSLIMS! #RT AND SPREAD THE WORD #BoycottSixFlags#BREAKINGpic.twitter.com/btDYRKaywI #SixFlagsBaltimore #RT #BoycottSixFlags #BREAKING pic.twitter.com/btDYRKaywI  Anonymous (@exposes_racism) September 19, 2015 September 19, 2015 Six Flags Baltimore is closed to non-Muslims on September 19! FUCK Six Flags and FUCK the Muslim Family Day!  Dr. Frank Corleone (@DaGodfather907) September 18, 2015 September 18, 2015 Both inferences were misleading. Muslim Family Day is one of several private events organized by a variety of groups at Six Flags locations across the United States; when a group pays to rent a Six Flags park for a private event, it's up to that group to determine how to distribute tickets for the event. Moreover, most Six Flags parks have a \"Religious Group Events\" page, and Six Flags St. Louis, for example, features a description geared towards attracting private events for Christian groups: page Six Flags is the place for friends, fellowship and fun. Whether youre looking for a way to bring your church community together in a new and thrilling setting or celebrating with your youth group after a mission trip, Six Flags provides entertainment for guests of all ages. We offer a variety of programs that can enhance your visit to the park including concerts by the hottest names in Christian talent and catered options in our private picnic grove. If youre looking for a special way to celebrate, host a Sunday service at Six Flags. We offer a variety of venues and amenities, giving you the unique opportunity to combine your praise time and play time. Six Flags St. Louis will make your visit to the park one that your church members will be talking about all year long. The wording appears to be part of a general Six Flags template, as a nearly identical page was found on the web site for Six Flags Magic Mountain in California. One such upcoming event slated for that venue is the 7 November 2015 \"Life Teen Catholic Youth Rally,\" and a flyer [PDF] for an August 2015 event at Six Flags St. Louis definitively answers the question of when \"Christian Family Day\" would be held by the amusement park chain: Magic Mountain event PDF In addition, there was \"Christian Family Night\" at Magic Mountain on 11 September 2015 (and a Hallelujah Jubilee the following day), a Christian music festival at Six Flags over Washington, D.C. in August 2015 [PDF], an April 2015 Christian Concert Weekend, and a Christian Fellowship Day hosted at Six Flags Over Georgia in July 2015. Many of the Christian-themed Six Flags events prior to July 2015 were subsequently archived and can no longer be accessed (so those events are likely just a handful of many that have occurred over the years). Christian Family Night Hallelujah Jubilee PDF Christian Concert hosted So while it's true that at least three Six Flags parks hosted a Muslim Family Day in 2015, many more Christian-themed private events have been held at the chain's parks (and contrary to some rumors, no \"uproar\" of \"offended Muslims\" has sought to stop them or threatened a boycott). Muslim Family Day (like any other private event) is for ticket-holders only, but non-Muslims who wished to attend were neither prohibited from doing so nor \"banned\" from the parks. Each Six Flags location features a page inviting groups to book religious events, and those pages primarily focus on Christian groups, churches, and organizations in their wording. ",

Well, now it's actually true. (Really. Check at the bottom if you don't believe me.) Sign the petition telling Congress to save NPR and PBS: https://www.moveon.org/publicbroadcasting/ https://www.moveon.org/publicbroadcasting/ A House panel has voted to eliminate all public funding for NPR and PBS, starting with \"Sesame Street,\" \"Reading Rainbow,\" and other commercial-free children's shows. If approved, this would be the most severe cut in the history of public broadcasting, threatening to pull the plug on Big Bird, Cookie Monster, and Oscar the Grouch. The cuts would slash 25% of the federal funding this year  $100 million  and end funding altogether within two years. The loss could kill beloved children's shows like \"Clifford the Big Red Dog,\" \"Arthur,\" and \"Postcards from Buster.\" Rural stations and those serving low-income communities might not survive. Other stations would have to increase corporate sponsorships. Already, 300,000 people have signed the petition. Can you help us reach 400,000 signatures today? https://www.moveon.org/publicbroadcasting/\n https://www.moveon.org/publicbroadcasting/ Origins:  Although a long-outdated  piece decrying supposed upcoming cuts in funding for the NEA, NPR, PBS, and Sesame Street has been circulating for years (it addressed legislation already voted upon way back in 1995), recent congressional efforts have brought the issue to public attention again. piece In June 2005 the House Appropriations Committee voted to sharply reduce federal financial support for public broadcasting. If this budgetary plan were approved it would eliminate within two years all federal money for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), money which currently makes up 15% of the funding for public broadcasting.  As the Washington Post reported: CPB \n\nA House subcommittee voted yesterday to sharply reduce the federal government's financial support for public broadcasting, including eliminating taxpayer funds that help underwrite such popular children's educational programs as \"Sesame Street,\" \"Reading Rainbow,\" \"Arthur\" and \"Postcards From Buster.\" In addition, the subcommittee acted to eliminate within two years all federal money for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting  which passes federal funds to public broadcasters  starting with a 25 percent reduction in CPB's budget for next year, from $400 million to $300 million. In all, the cuts would represent the most drastic cutback of public broadcasting since Congress created the nonprofit CPB in 1967. The CPB funds are particularly important for small TV and radio stations and account for about 15 percent of the public broadcasting industry's total revenue. The House measure also cuts support for a variety of smaller projects, such as a $39.6 million public TV satellite distribution network and a $39.4 million program that helps public stations update their analog TV signals to digital format.\n Although this legislation, if approved, would not  (as claimed in older petitions) affect funding for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), it would obviously have a significant impact on public broadcasting outlets, which would have to turn to other sources to try to make up the lost revenue. On 23 June 2005 the House of Representatives decided, by a 284-140 vote, to rescind the House Appropriations Committee's proposed $100 million cut in federal funds from the budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  Other areas of public broadcasting, however, may still face budget reductions if proposed funding cuts are not overturned: \n\nBut Elmo and Big Bird remain at risk. The House did not restore all of the public broadcasting funding cuts proposed for 2006. Although yesterday's amendment would bump CPB's general budget back to $400 million, the 2005 funding level, an additional $102.4 million that had been shorn from separate public broadcasting programs was not restored. That money underwrites the production of such PBS children's programs as \"Sesame Street,\" \"Arthur\" and \"Postcards From Buster.\" The money that would be cut also pays for satellite technology, basic equipment purchases and a federal mandate program to convert public TV stations from analog transmission to digital signal technology.\n\n  Last updated:  24 June 2005\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   Farhi, Paul.  \"Public Broadcasting Targeted by House.\" \n   The Washington Post.  10 June 2005  (p.

Origins:  We started seeing the e-mailed appeal about Olenka Kuczma, the girl pictured above,\nshow up in our inbox in August 2005, but information regarding little Ola was difficult to come by as nearly all media coverage of the case occurred in her home country of Poland.  Based on background information about her gleaned from the Polish media, we were able to determine that the one-year-old was caught in a house fire in June 2005 and suffered severe burns  as depicted in the photograph accompanying the text, including head and facial burns that resulted in the loss of her right ear.  (The mention of a \"rigging fire\" in the original message is likely a mistranscription of the phrase \"raging fire.\") Ola was taken under the care of doctors at University Children's Hospital in Krakow and has since undergone dozens of operations,  including a good many skin grafts and reconstructive surgeries, which her parents were ill able to afford (especially since they lost nearly everything they owned in the fire).  As of 2010, Ola was expected to undergo further surgical treatment in Cincinnati, Ohio.   Unfortunately, although Ola's plight was publicized on Polish television, the e-mail message about her that has been circulated in English via e-mail and social media provides no genuine means for caring readers to help contribute to Ola's medical care. Instead, the message  continues to be accompanied by hoax claims that 3 cents (or 3 dollars) will be contributed to her medical treatment every time her photo is forwarded, shared, or liked. publicized hoax A follow-up article about Ola from 2010 indicated that scammers had taken advantage of her plight to enrich themselves and provided legitimate donation for those who wish to help. follow-up Last updated:  6 August 2015\n ",

            "Tim Hortons doesn't secretly add nicotine to their coffee to make it addictive to customers, and neither does any other coffee chain in Canada or the United States."
        ],
        "justification": "Although Canada has its share of Starbucks outlets, the local Tim Hortons is the destination of choice for the average Canadian in search of a quick pick-me-up. The coffee vended there is exceptional, but just as important, most of these shops are open 24 hours a day, making a stop at these donut emporiums a personal ritual that can fit into anyone's daily routine no matter what shift he might work. Tim Hortons is Canada's best-known coffee and fresh baked goods chain, established in 1964 and now boasting more than 3,400 stores across Canada and over 800 additional locations within the United States. The chain's reputation rests just as much upon its coffee as its baked goods, so coffee not sold within twenty minutes of its first being offered for sale is thrown out to ensure that patrons always get a fresh cup of java for their money. According to the President and C.O.O. of Tim Hortons, Paul House, the coffee's special appeal to consumers is the result of a superior blend and careful quality control: The Tim Hortons special blend of coffee has been closely guarded from the beginnings of the chain, and is subject to stringent quality assurance measures by a team of coffee experts located at the Tim Hortons head office in Oakville, Ontario. \"We do extensive testing and cupping of our coffee to ensure the highest quality standards are met, and now our people can extend that quality right into the roasting process here in Rochester,\" said [Paul] House. \"We start with the best possible arabica beans from various countries of the world to create our special blend, and can follow those beans right through the roasting and packaging processes.\" Because folks are willing to line up to purchase Tim Hortons coffee rather than secure their daily cup from another source, some people have begun looking for a more sinister explanation beyond the obvious one of \"The coffee is really good, the donuts are fresh, and they're always open.\" The combination of reasonable prices, tasty product, and numerous convenient locations appears to have spawned a particular rumor that attempts to explain the popularity of Tim Hortons' coffee: according to the whispers, the beverage has been made so alluring through the addition of nicotine, MSG, or \"the maximum amount of caffeine allowed by law.\" In one elaborate version of the rumor, a Tim Hortons patron suffers a puzzling and severe allergic reaction after drinking some of the chain's coffee; only under duress (and an insistence on absolute secrecy) does a Tim Hortons executive disclose to the treating doctor a list of the ingredients in their \"special blend\"  a list that reveals the presence of nicotine. Variants of the basic rumor assert it's not the coffee itself that's loaded with nicotine, but the chain's coffee filters or that nicotine has been sprayed on the inside of its disposable cups. MSG But Tim Hortons coffee does not include nicotine, MSG, an usually high level of caffeine, or any similar additives. Just as the USA has its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to oversee the safety of commercially-sold ingestibles, so Canada has its Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). Neither agency would permit the knowing inclusion of dangerous substances in a foodstuff vended to an unwary public. CFIA Nicotine is one of the most powerful poisons known. Though we normally think in terms of arsenic and strychnine when the term 'poison' comes up, the truth is that nicotine is far more deadly. The lethal dose of arsenic for a 150 pound adult is 200 mg., for strychnine 75 mg., but for nicotine only 60 mg. Nicotine can and does kill even in relatively small amounts. Those who wear nicotine patches must exercise great care about the disposal of their used patches lest children or pets come in contact with the seemingly \"spent\" aids and become deeply sickened or even possibly die. Not surprisingly, nicotine is not permitted as a food additive in either Canada or the U.S. As for MSG, although the FDA has designated the additive \"generally recognized as safe,\" many people claim to experience adverse effects (such as headaches) after ingesting it, so all consumables containing the substance have to be clearly labelled to indicate its presence. The \"nicotine additive\" rumor does not adhere solely to Tim Hortons; it has been kited about other business concerns whose products have proved to be highly (and some would say inexplicably) popular: A friend mentioned that since 1987, McDonalds was putting nicotine into hamburgers to make them addictive. I heard that McDonald's experimented with putting nicotine in their fries to create an addictive property. I just received an email from a friend which claims that Pokemon cards are coated with nicotine, so children will become addicted. The letter claims that Philip Morris company is behind this. In another form the rumor has been known to take, evil-intentioned companies or heartless universities are said to be slipping laxatives into their food to lessen the effects of food poisoning: While at lunch with some friends yesterday, i heard what to me, sounds like a classic urban legend. Apparently there is a tale making the rounds that claims all fast food restaurants inject laxatives into their food so that people will pass the food on quickly, thereby reducing the risk of patrons getting food poisoning. Some of my students have told me something that sounds like an urban legend. They say that the dining service here (Lafayette College) is \"required\" to put a certain amount of laxatives in the food so that in case people get food poisoning the food will get out of people's systems. In yet another form of the basic rumor, conscienceless fast food companies have been incorporating anti-emetics into their offerings to help patrons keep their food down: In a recent debate with some friends of mine, we started talking about McDonald's and my friends kept telling me that McDonald's add an ingredient that prevents people from throwing up after eating there. A blow to the heart of the rumor in all its manifestations is that extraneous chemicals could not be surreptitiously slipped into any company's ingestible products without leaving that concern open to a stream of customer lawsuits. In the case of nicotine, the number of wrongful death suits filed would be unimaginable, given that it wouldn't take much of that particular poison to kill someone. As for MSG, caffeine, laxatives, or anti-emetics, there is no substance so innocuous that it won't provoke allergic or violent physical reactions in some people. Whatever small advantage a company might gain by adding a little extra something that would addict clients to its offerings would be quickly offset by multi-million dollar losses in civil court and a loss of consumer confidence in the even higher court of public opinion. Folks ain't going to patronize a place known for killing or sickening its customers, no matter how good the coffee. The Tim Hortons rumors reached such prominence that in February 2004 the CBC news program Disclosure conducted its own investigation, one which included having samples of coffee from Tim Hortons (and a couple of competing chains) sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results: Tim Hortons coffee contained no measurable amount of nicotine and had, on average, less caffeine than coffee from either Starbucks or Second Cup. nicotine caffeine Tim Hortons' loyal customer base was built the old-fashioned way: good product served fresh in easily-accessible locations.

Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza attempted to dispel these rumors during an appearance on All in with Chris Hayes: attempted Black Lives Matter has never, ever called for the murder of police officers, Garza told Hayes. What we have said over and over again is that it is time in this country for policing to be accountable, transparent and responsible. Thats not rhetoric. That is what communities in the United States want to see from the people who protect and serve them. And so quite frankly, we can, at the same time as we grieve the loss of life of several officers who were killed last night, we can also push to demand that there be accountable, responsive, transparent policing that has oversight form communities and that is accountable to the communities they are supposed to protect and serve. Garza added that Black Lives Matter isnt concerned with inciting more violence  in fact, the movement condemns it  but with tearing down the assumption that black people are criminals. We are not anti-police, she declared. We are anti our people being murdered in the streets. What happened to Alton Sterling, what happened to Philando, what happens to so many black people in our communities is absolutely unacceptable, and I think thats something that we can all agree on. Ironically, those upset over Pandora's message announced that they would be boycotting the streaming music service on Facebook, even though Facebook openly expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement by erecting a Black Lives Matter sign outside their headquarters in Menlo Park, California: support  ",

In her memory, he sleeps only on his half of the bed, only on his pillow, only on top of the sheets, never between, with just the old bedspread they shared to keep him warm. There's never been a finer man in American sports than John Wooden, or a finer coach. He won 10 NCAA basketball championships at UCLA, the last in 1975. Nobody has ever come within six of him. [Rest of article here]\n\n here Origins:  So often the stories we classify as   glurge have precious little factual basis to them, existing primarily as parables meant to inspire rather than inform. Yet that is not the case here  this item paints an accurate portrait of John Wooden, the renowned basketball coach. glurge We can't fathom why the article quoted above suddenly became a hot e-mail forward in 2004.  It was originally published under the title of \"A Paragon Rising Above the Madness\" in the 20 March 2000 issue of Sports Illustrated and is the work of Rick Reilly, the well-known sportswriter who pens the \"Life of Reilly\" column found on the last page of every issue of that publication. Reilly's writings also often appear in Time magazine, and he is the author of a number of books, including Whose Your Caddy?, The Life of Reilly, Missing Links, and Slo-Mo; My Untrue Story. John Wooden's accomplishments as a basketball coach are almost impossible to summarize because they are so many. The briefest of thumbnail sketches (offered on the understanding that we couldn't begin to do justice to his record without running on for paragraph after paragraph) would note that during his overall career as a head coach he achieved an unequaled win-loss record of 885-203 (for a winning percentage of 81.3), and that during his 27 years as head coach of the UCLA Bruins, his teams achieved a 620-147 record and won an unprecedented 10 NCAA championships, including seven in a row (1967-73). Yet his accomplishments as a basketball coach are only part of his story.   His character  the man he is  almost dwarfs them by  comparison. His life story and philosophy of living have been recounted in numerous books: My Personal Best: Life Lessons from an All-American Journey, They Call Me Coach, Coach Wooden One-On-One, Inch and Miles: The Journey to Success, Be Quick  But Don't Hurry: Learning Success From the Teachings of a Lifetime, Wooden: A Lifetime of Observations & Reflections On and Off the Court, John Wooden Pyramid of Success. This man, who came to be called the Wizard of Westwood in deference to his achievements as UCLA's basketball coach, was born in 1910; during World War II, he took a time-out from his coaching and teaching career to serve as a full lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. He was married for 53 years to his childhood sweetheart (who died in 1985) and raised two children with her; Wooden now also has seven grandchildren and eleven great-grandchildren. Though John Wooden's career as a coach ended in 1975, his teachings live on. Although it's possible the claim of his knowing the whereabouts of 172 of the 180 men who played for him is a bit of an exaggeration, certainly a great many of his former players have stayed in touch over the years.  Many of his sayings have stuck with his players, including his 'pyramid of success': \"Success is the peace of mind which is the direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing that you have made the effort to become the best person that you are capable of becoming.\" As for the anecdote about how the Wizard of Westwood handled a rebellious player insistent upon breaking tonsorial rules, not only has the player in question (Bill Walton) been quoted in news articles as telling the story, but so has John Wooden. However, the tale has been around so long that Wooden tells two versions of it, one involving long hair, the other a beard: \n\nI've always enjoyed Bill Walton. He's his own man. You've probably heard this story but one time he told me he wasn't going to get a haircut. He told me I didn't have the right to make him get a haircut. I said, \"No, I don't, Bill. I just have the right to determine who is going to play  and we're going to miss you.\"   One day, All-America center Bill Walton showed up with a full beard. \"It's my right,\" he insisted. Wooden asked if he believed that strongly. Walton said he did. \"That's good, Bill,\" Coach said. \"I admire people who have strong beliefs and stick by them, I really do. We're going to miss you.\" Walton shaved it right then and there. Now Walton calls once a week to tell Coach he loves him.\n The coach's monthly letters to his deceased wife Nellie are also a matter of record; they are mentioned in any number of articles about the man, often by reporters who have themselves seen them. On the 21st day of every month, after visiting her grave at Forest Lawn, Coach Wooden writes her a letter, which he leaves on the pillow on her side of the bed. Each of those letters ends with his telling her he misses her every day and looks forward to the time he can be with her again.  Nothing has changed in the house they shared together since she's been gone. \"Every picture on the walls are the ones Nellie chose, the ones she wanted up,\" said John Wooden. \"I've changed nothing, except add pictures of the great-grandchildren she never had a chance to see.\" Coach Wooden embraced the unchanging in other areas of his life besides decor.  He had three main rules for his players: Be on time, do not use profanity at any time, and never criticize a teammate. The following description of him comes from a 1997 Deseret News article: \n\nA great coach, he is a better man, and that has always been his broad appeal. Grace, wit, wisdom, perspective, humility, love, competence, devotion and spirituality have rarely been packaged so well in one tiny man. One of his players was recently asked to choose one word to describe Wooden. He chose \"Saint.\" Wooden's message has not changed. The old Indiana school teacher is still teaching personal values, discipline, hard work and self-improvement. He's still teaching his famous Pyramid of Success, which encompasses all of the above and more.\n Fittingly, the recognition bestowed on the nation's best college basketball player is named the John R. Wooden Award. Begun in 1976, it is conferred annually. In 2004, it was joined by the Women's Wooden Award, a trophy honoring the year's top female college basketball player. On 4 June 2010, John Wooden passed away. He was 99.

            "\"Dear God, Will you please take special care of our dog, Abbey?\" "

        "justification": "Since October 2006 this story has come to us under a variety of titles, including \"Going Postal,\" \"Angels at the Post Office,\" \"Angels Turn Up In Unexpected Places,\" and \"This is a US Postal Service Story.\" Example: Some of you may know that our 14 year old dog, Abbey, died last month (8/23). The day after she died, my 4 year old daughter Meredith was crying and talking about how much she missed Abbey. She asked if we could write a letter to God so that when Abbey got to heaven, God would recognize her. She dictated and I wrote: Dear God,\nWill you please take special care of our dog, Abbey? She died yesterday and is heaven. We miss her very much. We are happy that you let us have her as our dog even though she got sick. I hope that you will play with her. She likes to play with balls and swim before she got sick. I am sending some pictures of her so that when you see her in heaven you will know she is our special dog. But I really do miss her. Love,\nMeredith Claire P.S.: Mommy wrote the words after Mer told them to her We put that in an envelope with 2 pictures of Abbey, and addressed it to God/Heaven. We put our return address on it. Then Mer stuck some stamps on the front (because, as she said, it may take lots of stamps to get a letter all the way to heaven) and that afternoon I let her drop it into the letter box at the post office. For a few days, she would ask if God had gotten the letter yet. I told her that I thought He had. Yesterday, for Labor Day, we took the kids to Austin to a natural history museum. When we got back, there was a package wrapped in gold paper on our front porch. Curious, I went to look at it. It had a gold star card on the front and said \"To: Mer\" in an unfamiliar hand. Meredith took it in and opened it. Inside was a book by Mr. Rogers, When a Pet Dies. Taped to the inside front cover was the letter we had written to God, in its opened envelope (which was marked 'Return to Sender: Insufficient address'). On the opposite page, one of the pictures of Abbey was taped under the words \"For Meredith.\" We turned to the back cover, and there was the other picture of Abbey, and this handwritten note on pink paper: Dear Mer,\nI know that you will be happy to know that Abbey arrived safely and soundly in Heaven! Having the pictures you sent to me was such a big help. I recognized Abbey right away. You know, Meredith, she isn't sick anymore. Her spirit is here with me  just like she stays in your heart  young and running and playing. Abbey loved being your dog, you know. Since we don't need our bodies in heaven, I don't have any pockets!  so I can't keep your beautiful letter. I am sending it to you with the pictures so that you will have this book to keep and remember Abbey. One of my angels is taking care of this for me. I hope the little book helps. Thank you for the beautiful letter. Thank your mother for sending it. What a wonderful mother you have! I picked her especially for you. I send my blessings every day and remember that I love you very much. By the way, I am in heaven and wherever there is love. Love,\nGod, and the special angel who wrote this after God told her the words. As a parent and a pet lover, this is one of the kindest things that I've ever experienced. I have no way to know who sent it, but there is some very kind soul working in the dead letter office. Just wanted to share this act of compassion :) dear friend  hope you enjoy it as much as I did According to Cary Clack of the San Antonio Express-News, the tale is real. In mid-August 2006, the San Antonio family of Greg and Joy Scrivener and their three children suffered the loss of Abbey, their 14-year-old black and white dog. Driven by concern for their pet's future welfare, 4-year-old Meredith, the Scriveners' middle child, dictated the note quoted above to her mother, then enclosed it and two photos of the family dog in an envelope addressed \"To: God in Heaven.\" This envelope, bearing the family's return address, was dropped into a mailbox at the Brook Hollow post office. Two weeks later, the Scriveners found on their front porch a package wrapped in gold-colored paper and addressed \"To: Mer.\" In the parcel, along with the letter from \"God\" quoted above, was a book by Fred Rogers (of TV's Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood fame), When a Pet Dies (a book that \"helps children share feelings of the loss of a pet while offering reassurance that grieving is a natural, healing thing to do\"). When a Pet Dies According to her mother, Meredith was comforted by the book and letter and was unastounded that God saw fit to write back. \"She wasn't surprised because she had such faith that her letter was going to get to God.\" (The oldest of the Scrivener children, 6-year-old Andy, was impressed, though: He \"thought it was pretty special his sister got a book from the angel,\" says his mum.) While Mrs. Scrivener considered asking at the post office about the package, she decided against it. \"I kind of like not knowing,\" she said. \"I don't know who took the time to do it, but it was an angel. We all think about doing these things, but no one takes the time to do it.\" However, even true tales become subject to embellishment when circulated on the Internet. Often accompanying the online version is a photograph of a little blonde girl hugging a black Labrador retriever, yet it is not a photo of the actual child and dog from the story. Instead, some unknown person in search of a \"little girl and her dog\" picture copied it from a web site belonging to an unrelated family. The child in the misattributed photo's actual name is Isabelle and the dog's name is Sara: photograph  Clack, Cary.  \"Angel Mails Solace, Affirms a Girl's Faith.\"\r\n  San Antonio Express-News.  22 October 2006  (Life; p. 1).",
