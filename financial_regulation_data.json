States and Europe that was fed by excess liquidity and poorly regulated mortgage markets.", "This became a problem, he said, when large financial institutions that had huge amounts of assets dependent on high housing prices found themselves with too little capital to stave off failure when the market crashed.", "After a number of financial firms failed, it caused a panic, and confidence in the financial system collapsed, Rosen said.", "With the collapse in confidence came a collapse in credit markets -- no one was able to borrow -- which ultimately caused a contraction of the real

on high housing prices found themselves with too little capital to stave off failure when the market crashed.", "After a number of financial firms failed, it caused a panic, and confidence in the
