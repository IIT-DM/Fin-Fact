(Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) funds provided an additional $133.72 in per pupil aid for every Wisconsin school district.", "In August 2022, Eversannounceda $75 million allocation of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds for school districts and independent charter schools.", "That amounted to an additional $91.15 per student.", "Tally that up, and it amounts to $312.87 more per student.", "But that is a break from how many would normally think of per-pupil spending, since it is focused on a narrow part of the overall education spending picture.", "And it leans heavily on the infusion of COVID-related federal aid, which is not a continuing source of revenue.", "According to the nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau, Evers doesnt appear to be referring to all state aid provided to school districts on a per-pupil basis but to the per-pupil categorical aid program.", "The 2019-21 budget did increase the amount provided to school districts in that program to $742 per-pupil in the 2018-19 school year and for each year thereafter, an LRB analyst said in response to PolitiFact Wisconsin query.", "This rate is statutory and will continue indefinitely unless changed by legislation.", "But there is a key wrinkle to the other parts of the funding: According to the LRB, the CARES funding was not in the 2021-23 budget act.", "Likewise, the ARPA funding  was a one-time payment to school districts and independent charter schools.", "As such, the payments are not part of a permanent, statutory program.", "So, some of the increased aid Evers has touted will continue indefinitely, while other funds are one-time payments and not permanent.", "(The $312.87 makes up only part of the average spent per student.", "According to the Legislative Fiscal BureausJanuary 2023 report, the figure in the 2020-21 school year for per pupil aid was $7,537) Jason Stein, vice president and research director of the Wisconsin Policy Forum,

million from the 2019-21 biennial budget due to Gov.", "Evers strategic, line-item veto wouldve been built into the base budget for the succeeding 2021-23 biennium so that is, by definition, an ongoing, state-supported investment, not temporary Cudaback said in an email.", "But that part, handled through the normal budget process, is not in dispute.", "Its the COVID-related money that is temporary.", "On that, Cudaback noted that school districts have extensive time, in some cases several years, to use the COVID related money.", "But that does not make it permanent.", "Finally, Cudaback also noted that the COVID-related spending came exclusively at Evers direction.", "But that, too, is really not in dispute.", "In any case, Stein, of the Public Policy Forum, offered an asterisk here.", "The governor was the principal Wisconsin actor who made (the state-based decisions), Stein said.", "That said, the federal relief funds came to Wisconsin because of legislation
