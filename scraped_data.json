the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says she hopes to force jab unvaccinated children via a new initiative called The Big Catch-up.", "However, the Big Catch-Up will not involve forced vaccinations, WHO spokesperson Daniel Epstein told us in an email.", "There are no mandatory vaccinations associated with this effort.", "Some countries require vaccines for children to enroll in school, he said.",

health services were overburdened or closed, access to medical supplies was disrupted, and peoples travel was restricted, the release explained.", "To ensure progress on childhood immunization, partners are working with countries to strengthen health care workforces, improve health service delivery, build trust and demand for vaccines within communities, and address gaps and obstacles to restoring immunization, the release said.", "It added that further effort needs to go into vaccinating adolescents against human papillomavirus.", "And while the Big Catch-Up is a global effort, it

issue is that the authors compared the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 with the number of adverse events of special interest  instead of comparing it with the number of people who

health emergency is not the definitive end of pandemic-related policies.", "Some  such as the eviction ban and the child tax credit expansion  have long ago ended.", "Others, including some changes to telehealth coverage and expanded access to free vaccines, are more permanent.", "Four other emergency declarations were also made in early 2020:  Costs of COVID-19 testing for individuals will rise,

tests through September 2024, before potentially facing costs.", "However, the requirement that insurers cover eight at-home COVID-19 tests per month will end for most other people on May 11.",

providers will also get more expensive for individuals.", "As of May 11, private insurers and Medicare Advantage plans will be able to charge patients for these tests and related visits, following the normal rules of their health care plan.", "People on traditional Medicare will still be able to get provider-ordered tests for free, but they may pay for visits associated with the tests.", "Programs

continue, including a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program designed for uninsured and other disadvantaged people.", "HHS also says the government may continue its popular mail-order at-home test program, depending on availability.", "Update, May 11: HHS says that the mail-order at-home test program will continue through the end of May.", "The end of the public health emergency will not immediately change the availability and costs of COVID-19 vaccines or oral antiviral treatments.", "This is because the public health emergency constituted just one of multiple layers of laws and policies that make vaccines and some treatments free.", "Currently, COVID-19 vaccines and oral antiviral drugs, such as Paxlovid, are sourced from the federal governments own supply.", "These doses must be offered at no cost regardless of whether there is a public health emergency.", "However, the government supply of vaccines is only expected to last through the summer or early fall, Kates said, depending on demand.", "It is also possible that a new version of the COVID-19 vaccine will come out, she said, and these will be provided commercially rather than through government purchases.", "Even after the federal vaccine doses run out, most people with insurance will still get recommended COVID-19 vaccines for free.", "Some laws requiring free vaccines for Medicaid and Medicare recipients were enacted during the pandemic, while requirements for no-cost coverage of any recommended vaccines from in-network providers were already in place for people with private insurance.", "Its really the uninsured who will be the most challenged because theres no permanent guarantee, Kates said.", "To fill this gap, the Biden administration has proposed a Vaccines for Adults program, similar to the Vaccines for Children program, which provides free vaccines to children whose families couldnt otherwise afford them.", "Congress has not been willing to enact this program, however.", "On April 18, the administration announced the Bridge Access Program, which will temporarily provide vaccines and treatments to the uninsured.", "This depends in part on the government purchasing vaccines and treatments, but also on pharmaceutical companies being willing to provide them for free.", "Its not permanent and its unclear how far it will go, Kates said.", "The federal supply of Paxlovid will be depleted by early fall, Kates said, and some people with private insurance or Medicare will face cost sharing, just like with other drugs.", "As with COVID-19 tests, people on Medicaid will continue to have access to free COVID-19 drugs through September 2024.", "The Biden administration has announced it will lift most federal vaccine mandates.", "These mandates are winding down around the same time as the public health emergency but were ended by a separate action.", "Vaccine requirements for certain noncitizens arriving in the U.S. by air or land will end May 11.", "Mandates for health care workers at facilities that treat patients on Medicare and Medicaid will also end soon, with more details to come.", "The administration also announced an end to vaccine requirements for Head Start and federal workers, although these mandates had already been blocked by courts.", "Many universities, cities and counties are also ending vaccine mandates or have recently ended them for students and workers.", "Congress passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act in March 2020, providing additional funding for states during the public health emergency to keep people continuously enrolled in Medicaid regardless of eligibility.", "This past December, Congress passed the fiscal year 2023 appropriations bill  which allowed states to start removing people from Medicaid who are no longer eligible or dont adhere to renewal requirements beginning April 1.", "KFF recently estimated that somewhere between 8 million and 24 million people could lose their Medicaid coverage.", "KFF assumed that 87.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid in March 2023, and federal data show that as of January there were nearly 86 million enrollees.", "Insurance coverage in the United States reached a high during the pandemic, and as expanded Medicaid comes to an end we are going to see a large increase in Americans who are underinsured, Sosin said.", "Some people will lose coverage because they are making more money and are no longer eligible, Kates explained.", "Others may temporarily become ineligible, lose Medicaid, and then become eligible again and re-enroll, a process called churn that continuous enrollment stopped.", "Finally, some people who are Medicaid eligible may be removed by mistake or be unable to prove their eligibility.", "Some of these people may be eligible for other programs, such as the Childrens Health Insurance Program or subsidized plans via the marketplace established by the Affordable Care Act.", "However, they may not know they are eligible or be able to promptly gain coverage through these programs.", "Some nutrition benefits that were expanded during the pandemic will also change, Harvard public policy expert Bleich and her colleagues recently wrote in JAMA Health Forum.", "Some changes, such as the end of temporary Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for certain college students in June, will be triggered directly by the end of the public health emergency.", "(SNAP benefits are also sometimes called food stamps.)", "One major change already has taken effect.", "Extra benefits, known as emergency allotments, were provided to SNAP households during the pandemic, but some states stopped providing the additional funds beginning in March 2021 and the program ended in the remaining 35 states in March of this year.", "Following the end of the emergency allotments, each SNAP household on average started receiving $175 less per month.", "Bleich also said lower Medicaid enrollment will lead people to miss out on nutrition benefits, since people are often connected with nutrition benefits through Medicaid.", "And the work involved in processing changes to Medicaid and SNAP in state offices may lead to delays.", "Other changes will affect fewer people but will be consequential for those individuals.", "For example, during the public health emergency, states were able to pay family caregivers for some people on Medicaid.", "While states are allowed to continue these programs, some have said they will end the programs following the end of the public health emergency.", "Title 42, which former President Donald Trump invoked as a public health measure at the beginning of the pandemic, will also end May 11.", "Title 42 allowed border officials to immediately expel many people trying to illegally enter the U.S., and ending it is expected to increase illegal crossings, as weve written before.", "Some other policies and changes allowed during the public health emergency will remain.", "For instance, many telehealth-related changes for people on Medicaid and Medicare have been made permanent or extended through the end of 2024, Kates said.", "Changes to rules about limits on take-home doses of methadone and access to controlled substances via telehealth will also be extended, with the intention to eventually make some permanent.", "Many changes will not be immediately obvious to the public, although they could have an indirect impact.", "Just to name a couple examples, hospitals will no longer receive extra money from Medicare for treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients and a number of waivers are ending, such as relaxed rules on what types of care different providers can give.", "COVID-19 data, including case and death counts, have already become less timely and reliable.", "The end of the public health emergency could further complicate pandemic data collection.", "Many jurisdictions will no longer report COVID-19 cases and deaths to the CDC, and HHS will be unable to require that laboratories report COVID-19 testing results, including negative ones.", "Of course, testing data already have become less complete as people have come to rely more on home tests, Kates said.", "The laboratory data on its own hasnt completely captured whats happening anyway, but its still been important, she added.", "In response to these and other changes, the CDC on May 5 described its new COVID-19 data strategy.", "To guide decision-making for individuals and communities, the CDC has previously provided COVID-19 Community Levels, based on a mixture of data on hospitalizations and cases.", "Now, the CDC says, people should use hospital admission levels to understand COVID-19 trends.", "However, hospitals will report data weekly rather than daily following the end of the public health emergency.", "The CDC says it will also rely on emergency department admissions data and the lab test results it is able to collect as an early indicator of changes.", "The agency will use death certificate data, rather than data from health departments, to track COVID-19 deaths.", "Based on the provisional death certificate information, the CDC will report in a new weekly indicator the percentage of all deaths that are associated with COVID-19.", "Many previous agreements between the CDC and jurisdictions on reporting vaccination data will also expire.", "However, the CDC has renegotiated agreements with most of them.", "Other changes to COVID-19 data are on the horizon.", "After April 30, 2024, hospitals participating in federal

could possibly do.", "The available data on face masks worn outside of laboratory studies  like N95s or surgical masks  also does not show biologically important changes in measurements associated with breathing.", "A 2021 review published in Annals of the American Thoracic Society, co-authored by Hopkins, looked at studies of mask use during physical activity, concluding that the effects on

do suggest masks may temporarily increase a perception of shortness of breath, the researchers said.", "A systematic review and meta-analysis by a different group of researchers, published in 2021 in

a change in performance while exercising.", "They only slightly increased heart rate and carbon dioxide released at the end of a breath, although Hopkins again said that this type of carbon dioxide measurement is problematic.", "Regardless, the authors called the changes to these physiological measurements minimal.", "There are logical flaws in the idea that masks  which can reduce the risk of

pandemic.", "These could include, for example, deaths occurring because of overburdened hospitals, or because of upticks in car crashes or drug overdoses.", "Especially early in the pandemic, many COVID-19 deaths were missed because of a lack of testing.", "According to CDC data, there have been more than 300,000 excess deaths since the beginning of the pandemic if those listing COVID-19 as a cause are excluded.", "Again, some of these deaths could still be due to COVID-19, but the disease was not listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death.", "The V-Damage Project calculates excess deaths due to vaccination using faulty logic.", "The report first reasonably states that its difficult to distinguish causes of death at the population level.", "It goes on to incorrectly say: Starting in the summer of 2021, however, with the introduction of mass vaccinations, the rise in natural immunity by exposure to the virus, and the emergence of milder and more contagious virus strains such as Omicron, it is difficult to argue if Covid-19 had a significant role in excess mortality.", "Therefore, we can use the total excess mortality in 2021 and 2022 as an estimate for vaccine-related deaths, or at least an estimated upper limit for the vaccine damage.", "There are several things wrong with this statement.", "First, a substantial number of people died from COVID-19 in the second half of 2021 and in 2022.", "By the start of summer 2021, there had been a little more than 600,000 COVID-19 deaths in the U.S.", "The death toll had risen to nearly 1.1 million by the end of 2022.", "And while the proportion of COVID-19 deaths in older versus younger adults increased over this time period, COVID-19 continued to kill people under age 65.", "As noted in a HealthFeedback article discussing a prior claim from Dowd about excess deaths, the timing of excess deaths during the pandemic indicates they are closely tied to COVID-19 deaths, not vaccination.", "An article from the Associated Press further notes that to show a relationship between vaccines and deaths, one would need to show that vaccinated people  and not unvaccinated people  died at elevated rates.", "The V-Damage Project doesnt provide information on deaths in vaccinated versus unvaccinated people.", "Second, omicron has been far from benign.", "Research shows that per infection, omicron has been less severe than earlier variants, in large part because more people have some immunity, either from infection, vaccination or both.", "There is also some evidence that omicron is naturally less virulent than the delta variant that directly preceded it, although omicron appears to be about as virulent as the original virus.", "But omicron spreads more readily to close contacts than delta, and vaccination is less effective at blocking transmission.", "This all added up to a record-breaking wave of COVID-19 cases in late 2021 and early 2022, which came with significant deaths.", "Third, the effects of the pandemic have been complex, and excess deaths related to the pandemic likely have multiple causes.", "Deaths due to drug overdoses, cardiometabolic disorders and other diseases were already increasing in younger Americans in the decade leading up to the pandemic.", "The pandemic accentuated the pre-existing mid-life mortality crisis in the U.S., researchers wrote in a 2022 study published in Nature Human Behavior.", "As weve mentioned, deaths due to drug overdoses, alcohol and motor vehicle accidents all increased in young adults in the U.S. in 2020 and 2021.", "A recent CDC report also shows an increase in suicides in 2021, including in young adult males.", "Finally, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have killed large numbers of people.", "The Food and Drug Administration and CDC have multiple systems for monitoring vaccine safety, and they have detected very few deaths caused by the vaccines.", "According to a CDC web page updated last month, nine deaths have been linked to a rare clotting disorder caused by the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.", "CDC and FDA continue to review reports of death following COVID-19 vaccination and update information as it becomes available, the web page says.", "In fact, the evidence shows that the vaccines have saved lives.", "Meara pointed to a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that compared death rates in June 2021 through March 2022 in the 10 states with the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates with the primary series versus the 10 states with the lowest rates.", "Per 100,000 people, there were 75 COVID-19 deaths in the most vaccinated states versus 146 in the least vaccinated states.", "Excess deaths from all causes were also lower in states with a high proportion of vaccinated individuals.", "It is unlikely that serious and severe adverse events from COVID-19 vaccines led to rising numbers of people with disabilities in 2021 and 2022, contrary to claims in the V-Damage report.", "The Bureau of Labor Statistics regularly carries out a nationally representative survey, called the Current Population Survey, of around 60,000 U.S. households.", "The survey data do show an increase in people reporting disabilities in 2021 and 2022.", "But Sean Smith, an economist with the Current Population Survey at the BLS, told us in an email that the survey data cannot be used to identify specific disabilities.", "We cannot determine from the questions asked if the disability is related to COVID or to an adverse reaction to a vaccine, he said.", "A November 2022 working paper from the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research pointed out that, beginning in the second quarter of 2021, the initial rise in the disability rate likely occurred because some people missed earlier interviews and were asked questions about disability in subsequent surveys.", "However, since then the rising prevalence of Long COVID and other new sources of disability signal that the increase may reflect an actual increase in the number of [people with disability], the researchers wrote.", "There is extensive data available on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines, and these data indicate it is unlikely that they caused a significant number of disabilities.", "The vast majority of side effects following vaccination  like fever and pain at the injection site  are temporary and are not serious.", "The V-Damage Report also relies on a paper written by emergency medicine physician Dr. Joseph Fraiman and colleagues to argue that vaccine damages led to the rise in disabilities.", "As weve previously explained, the paper makes an unsubstantiated claim about adverse events based on a flawed reanalysis of the clinical trials of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines.", "In reality, serious adverse events were uncommon in large, randomized mRNA vaccine trials and occurred at a similar rate among people who got the vaccines and those who got the placebos.", "Finally, the V-Damage report makes unsubstantiated claims that data from v-safe  a text messaging-based system that prompts people to report on their health after vaccination  show a concerning pattern of hospitalization.", "Our analysis shows that during the vaccine rollout process, the CDC had live real world data that corroborated the safety signals observed in the clinical trials, the report says.", "In fact, a 2022 analysis of data from v-safe and another vaccine monitoring system called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System showed that most reported adverse events from mRNA vaccines during the first six months of the vaccination program were mild and short in duration.", "As weve previously explained, less than 1% of people enrolled in v-safe sought medical care in the week after each vaccine dose.", "An even smaller number, less than 0.1%, were hospitalized in the week after receiving each dose.", "Further, v-safe prompts participants to report any health event or hospitalization, not just ones they believe are related to vaccination.", "Similarly, VAERS accepts reports of any post-vaccination event, regardless of the cause.", "Many people take time off from work temporarily due to minor side effects from COVID-19 vaccines, but these absences do not explain a larger pattern of increasing absences since 2020.", "The V-Damage Project uses data on side effects from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to claim that full-time workers experienced injuries from COVID-19 vaccines and that the vaccines caused a degradation of individuals immune systems.", "But as weve noted, very few side effects were serious or lasting, and there is no evidence the vaccines harm the immune system.", "The report goes on to cite data from the BLS to claim that these vaccine injuries led to absences from work.", "But work absences due to own illness, injury, or medical problems increased at the start of the pandemic, according to Smith, the BLS economist.", "When counting absences that lasted the entire week, absences due to sickness reached 1.3 million in March 2020 and 2 million in April 2020  then a record-high number.", "The V-Damage Project acknowledges this early-pandemic increase  prior to the arrival of vaccines  but says that the largest rise in absence rates was in 2022 and that this occurred after the main impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.", "However, the unusually large number of sickness-related absences in 2022 can be attributed to a spike at the beginning of the year.", "Sickness-related absences further increased to a series high of 3.6 million in January 2022, however this measure dropped to 1.6 million in February 2022 and since then has been similar to the average levels seen in 2020 and 2021, Smith told us in an email.", "As before with disabilities, Smith said that BLS does not have information on the type of illness that caused people to miss work.", "But it is worth noting that omicron cases peaked in the U.S. in early 2022, breaking prior records for weekly COVID-19 cases.", "The BLS data on absences appear more closely tied to COVID-19 cases than vaccinations.", "Emma Xiaolu Zang, an assistant professor of sociology at Yale University, who has done research on illness-related work absences early in the pandemic, told us via email that absences in 2022 were likely part of a longer-term pattern of COVID-19-related absences.", "COVID vaccines were unlikely to be the reason for the spike in [sickness-related absences], which started in early 2020, Zang said.", "Editors

Rulings ", "author": "Lori Robertson and Jessica McDonald", "posted": null, "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["Mifepristone, sold under the brand name Mifeprex and also known as RU-486, is a drug approved by the FDA to terminate pregnancies through 10 weeks (70 days) of gestation.", "Its the first of two medicines that are taken together as part of medication or medical abortion in the U.S.", "In the FDA-approved regimen for medication abortion, one mifepristone pill is taken by mouth on the first day.", "Between 24 and 48 hours later, the patient places two tablets of another medicine called misoprostol in each cheek pouch, and lets them dissolve.", "Patients typically begin to expel pregnancy tissue two to 24 hours after taking the second drug.", "Patients then follow-up with their health care provider a week or two after taking mifepristone to ensure that the pregnancy has been successfully terminated.", "Mifepristone ends pregnancies by blocking the hormone progesterone, which is required to maintain a pregnancy.", "Without the progesterone signal, the uterine lining with the implanted embryo or fetus is shed.", "Mifepristone also makes the uterine muscle more sensitive to prostaglandins, including misoprostol, which triggers contractions and helps open the cervix.", "In some countries, misoprostol is used alone in medication abortions, but research shows the drug combo is more effective and may have fewer side effects.", "While FDAs approved mifepristone regimen requires misoprostol, misoprostol is not FDA-approved for abortion, so technically it is used off-label for that purpose.", "Off-label prescribing, which is common, is when a doctor prescribes a drug in a different way or for a different condition than the one for which it was approved.", "Outside of medication abortion, mifepristone is used off-label to help patients experiencing miscarriages or stillbirths expel pregnancy tissue and avoid procedures.", "The pill is also FDA-approved to treat high blood sugar in certain Cushings syndrome patients.", "The FDA approved mifepristone for medication abortion in September 2000, after reviewing the available evidence and finding that the benefits outweighed the risks.", "This included four phase 3 clinical trials: two in the U.S., and another two in France, where the drug was developed and was approved in 1988.", "It also included post-marketing safety data from numerous other countries, including France, Sweden and the U.K., all places where the drug had been in use since at least the early 1990s.", "An FDA document shows that at the time of approval, mifepristone was approved in 21 other countries (see page 9).", "In 2000, the mifepristone approval pertained to pregnancies seven weeks along or less.", "Due to some safety concerns  particularly the fact that mifepristone sometimes fails, should not be given to people whose pregnancies are located outside of the uterus, and rare excessive bleeding can occur  the agency imposed several restrictions, later known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, on mifepristone.", "Under the regulations at the time, the drug could not be sold in pharmacies or online, and instead was supplied directly to doctors meeting certain qualifications, including being able to accurately date pregnancies, diagnose ectopic pregnancies, and having the ability to perform or arrange for any necessary surgery.", "Certified doctors, who gave mifepristone to patients in person, also had to provide a medication guide to patients and agree to report any adverse events to the drugmaker.", "Over the years, the FDA continued to monitor the safety and efficacy of mifepristone and made slight modifications to the required restrictions.", "Most notably, in 2016, the agency extended approval to pregnancies up through 10 weeks of gestation, allowed health care providers other than physicians to become certified to provide mifepristone, and reduced the required office visits for patients from three to one.", "Given 15 years of safety data showing the known serious risks occur rarely  and no sign of new safety concerns  the agency also dropped the requirement that providers report all adverse events, requiring only deaths to be reported.", "In April 2019, the FDA approved a generic of Mifeprex.", "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA did not enforce the in-person dispensing requirement, allowing mifepristone to be mailed to patients.", "In 2023, after reviewing the evidence, the agency dropped the in-person requirement from the REMS program altogether and added a requirement that any pharmacies that offer the drug be certified.", "Current REMS regulations therefore require that a certified health care provider prescribe mifepristone, but that person does not need to be a physician, nor does the pill need to be given to the patient by that provider.", "Instead, mifepristone can be mailed to patients by certified pharmacies.", "Patients still must be given a medication guide and health care providers must inform patients of the risks of using mifepristone.", "On its website, the FDA notes that the agency has never removed a drug with a REMS from the market due to new or serious issues that could not be mitigated by the REMS.", "Today, mifepristone is approved in about 80 other countries, according to the FDA.", "A group of four anti-abortion organizations and four physicians filed a lawsuit  Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration  in November 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.", "That was five months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe in a 5-4 ruling that said the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion  and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives.", "The plaintiffs challenged the FDAs approval in 2000 of mifepristone and subsequent REMS modifications to how the drug can be prescribed and dispensed.", "On April 7, Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, sided with the plaintiffs arguments, ordering a stay, or suspension, of the approval and subsequent actions related to it.", "Legal experts have said this is the first time a judge has gone against FDA objections and overruled a drug it has approved.", "Plaintiffs have pointed to no case, and the government has been unable to locate any example, where a court has second-guessed FDAs safety and efficacy determination, the federal government said in a January 2023 brief.", "The federal courts order is a preliminary injunction, which is issued before a trial and final judgment in the case if the plaintiffs show they are likely to succeed in the lawsuit on its merits and theres a threat of irreparable harm without the injunction, among other factors.", "Kacsmaryk delayed his order for seven days to allow time for an appeal to the 5th U.S.", "Circuit Court of Appeals, which the federal government and Danco Laboratories, a manufacturer of mifepristone and also a defendant in the case, promptly filed.", "In February, Democratic attorneys general filed suit, also against the FDA, saying the agency should remove restrictions on who can prescribe and dispense mifepristone.", "On the same day as the Texas court ruling, District Court Judge Thomas O.", "Rice in the Eastern District of Washington granted a preliminary injunction barring the FDA from altering the status quo and rights as it relates to the availability of Mifepristone in the 17 states, plus the District of Columbia, of the plaintiffs.", "The ruling by Rice, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, doesnt change the FDAs restrictions under REMS.", "The plaintiffs argue these burdensome restrictions on a drug that has been administered for more than 20 years with only exceedingly rare adverse events have no basis in science.", "It only serves to make mifepristone harder for doctors to prescribe, harder for pharmacies to fill, harder for patients to access, and more burdensome for the Plaintiff States and their health care providers to dispense.", "In addition to D.C., the states are: Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Vermont, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Pennsylvania.", "Abortion is legal in all of those states.", "Rice later confirmed that the rulings in the Texas case, including from the appeals court, had no bearing on his order pertaining to those states.", "On April 12, the 5th Circuit overruled part of Kacsmaryks injunction.", "The three-judge panel  two appointed by Trump and one by former president George W. Bush  said the anti-abortion groups had waited too long to file suit against the FDAs 2000 approval of mifepristone, so that couldnt be suspended.", "The challenge was beyond the statute of limitations.", "But the appeals court ruled that the agencys subsequent actions on the drug could still be challenged and would be suspended under Kacsmaryks order while the case proceeded.", "As we explained, those subsequent actions include allowing distribution to patients via mail and the  FDAs 2016 REMS that allowed mifepristone to be prescribed up to 10 weeks of gestation rather than seven weeks and permitted health care providers who arent doctors, such as nurse practitioners, to prescribe it.", "The 5th Circuit ruling is temporary as the appeal proceeds.", "The court set oral arguments for May 17.", "There are many legal claims in this case, but David S. Cohen, a professor of law at Drexel University and an expert in legal issues concerning abortion, explained to us that there were three main claims in Kacsmaryks April 7 ruling in the District Court: that mifepristone isnt safe, that the FDA incorrectly used a regulation in approving it, and that the FDA violated an 1873 law that would ban the mailing of the drug.", "On all three, the judge sided with the plaintiffs over the FDA.", "The FDA approval process requires drugmakers to demonstrate safety and effectiveness through clinical trials, and after a drug is approved, the agency continues to monitor its use.", "In its brief, the FDA said its 2000 approval rested on a comprehensive evaluation of the scientific data, that subsequent evidence confirms that mifepristone has been demonstrably safe and effective in practice, when considered based on clinicians real-world experience prescribing the medication, and that serious adverse events are rare, according to the agencys review of the scientific literature.", "Well have more about mifepristones safety below.", "Kacsmaryk, though, wrote that [c]ompelling evidence suggests the FDAs statistics on adverse events understate the negative impact the chemical abortion regimen has on women and girls, using terminology for the two-drug regimen preferred by anti-abortion advocates.", "(The judge also repeatedly referred to a fetus or embryo as an unborn human.)", "Among the evidence offered by the plaintiffs on mifepristones safety is a 2021 study that weve written about before on emergency room visits by Medicaid patients authored by Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion group.", "Kacsmaryk cited it in his ruling, saying that medication abortions are over fifty percent more likely than surgical abortion to result in an emergency room visit within thirty days.", "But as weve explained, the higher rate of visits doesnt equate to a higher safety risk.", "Other research shows most ER visits by women with Medicaid, who may not have a primary care doctor, after a medication abortion werent for serious complications.", "Kacsmaryk also argued that medication abortion is harmful to womens mental health.", "He cited a study, co-authored by a researcher with Charlotte Lozier Institute, that analyzed 98 anonymous blog posts from women who had medication abortions and visited a website called Abortion Changes You.", "Many of the women who submitted a post regretted their abortions.", "But submissions to such a website are unlikely to be representative of the experience of most people.", "Moreover, other research, including the most rigorous work, has not found that abortion causes mental health problems such as depression, anxiety or suicidal thoughts, or leads to drug use, as some have proposed.", "The best studies compare outcomes in people who had abortions with those who were denied an abortion.", "One such study, known as the Turnaway Study, not only found no increase in mental health issues in those who had abortions, but found that those who were denied an abortion were more likely to suffer anxiety and have low self-esteem in the short term, experience poor physical health, and to fall below the federal poverty level, among other negative outcomes.", "On the FDA regulation point, the judge said the FDA erred in using a regulation called Subpart H in approving mifepristone.", "Subpart H allows for approval of new drugs that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments.", "It also allows the FDA to impose restricted distribution requirements, as a Government Accountability Office report on mifepristones approval explains.", "It took more than four years for the FDA to approve the drug after the drug sponsor submitted its application.", "Kacsmaryk agreed with the plaintiffs that this regulation shouldnt apply in this case because pregnancy isnt an illness but rather a normal physiological state most women experience.", "The FDA said that neither the agency nor Congress had adhered to that narrow interpretation.", "The FDA said the regulation applies to drugs used for serious conditions, as explained in its final rule.", "Congress later ratified FDAs understanding of its regulation by using the language disease or condition in a law pertaining to the REMS framework.", "Finally, Kacsmaryk said the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in an argument that the FDA violated the 1873 Comstock Act by allowing the distribution of mifepristone via the mail, as it first did during the coronavirus pandemic in 2021.", "The judge wrote that the law prohibits mailing anything that would produce an abortion.", "The FDA argued that misconstrues the law  which was known as a chastity law and originally prohibited mailing birth control as well as any obscene, lewd or lascivious publications.", "As the Department of Justices Office of Legal Counsel has explained, however, since the early 20th century the Comstock Act has been understood not to prohibit all mailing or other conveyance of items that can be used to prevent or terminate pregnancy,' the FDA said in its brief.", "The FDA sought to have the suit tossed out, arguing that the plaintiffs didnt have standing.", "In order to sue in federal court, a plaintiff must show standing, meaning that they have been harmed, the defendant caused that harm and a ruling by the court could remedy the harm.", "Both the circuit court panel and district judge have ruled that the plaintiffs do have legal standing, although a number of legal scholars have questioned this.", "On the Comstock Act, the appeals court said it couldnt fully explore how and whether the law should apply given the speed of the District Courts ruling.", "But the judges wrote that the uncertainty over the laws applicability favors the plaintiffs because the defendants had the burden of proving their arguments to get the court to overturn the lower courts injunction.", "Our decision to grant partial relief does not reflect our view on any merits question, the judges wrote.", "But they did say the plaintiffs were unlikely to fail in claiming the FDA, in its 2016 and subsequent REMS changes, violated an arbitrary-and-capricious standard it must meet under the Administrative Procedure Act.", "The APA lays out how federal agencies can make rules and how the courts can review them.", "Under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard, agencies must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made, the judges wrote, citing prior court rulings.", "The appeals court did not delve into the meaning of illnesses in Subpart H.  As for the courts decision not to also overturn the District Courts stay on the FDAs 2016 and later changes, the judges wrote that the government and Danco didnt show how there would be irreparable harm from leaving that suspension in place.", "Numerous studies have demonstrated that mifepristone is safe and effective for terminating early pregnancies.", "According to mifepristones prescribing information, 22 clinical trials, including seven in the U.S., have evaluated mifepristone when used with misoprostol at 10 weeks or less of gestation.", "The results show patients on average have a complete medical abortion at least 96.2% of the time, meaning the drug fails in less than 4% of cases.", "The failure rate is even lower  below 2%  for pregnancies terminated at seven weeks or less, although it increases to less than 7% during the 10th week of gestation.", "Medication abortion with mifepristone is also safe.", "While most patients experience side effects, including nausea, weakness and fever, serious ones are rare.", "Ten clinical trials, according to the prescribing information, found that a serious adverse reaction, such as a blood transfusion or serious infection, affects fewer than 0.5% of people.", "Many other studies have borne this out, finding serious adverse events are typically below 1%, and often well below.", "As weve written before, a 2015 paper published in Obstetrics & Gynecology reviewed 20 other studies that collectively included more than 30,000 patients, and found that [s]evere adverse events like blood transfusion (0.030.6%) and hospitalization (0.040.9%) are uncommon (one co-author of that paper reported being a consultant for Danco).", "Cramping and bleeding  heavier than a normal period  are expected with medication abortion.", "The main concern is excessive bleeding, which can be dangerous and could indicate that the medications failed and the individual needs to complete the abortion with a procedure.", "Another concern is infection, which could lead in rare cases to sepsis.", "Its important to note that not all people are good candidates for medication abortion, as the drugs should not be used in people with ectopic pregnancies, those using an IUD, or in people with certain health conditions or those taking certain medications.", "Death is exceedingly rare.", "Through June 2022, the FDA received 28 reports of deaths out of the approximately 5.6 million people who took mifepristone since its approval.", "Reported deaths do not necessarily mean the death was caused by medication abortion; a number of the deaths were from causes that do not have any link to the medication, including suicide, homicide or suspected homicide, and drug abuse.", "Two deaths were due to ectopic pregnancies, while nine were for sepsis.", "Eight of the nine sepsis cases involved vaginal use of misoprostol, which is not part of the FDA-approved regimen for medication abortion.", "Death after medication abortion is so rare that its difficult to determine an accurate death rate, but one U.S. study suggests it is around 1 per 100,000 people.", "This is similar to the overall abortion death rate and significantly lower than the risk of dying from childbirth.", "Compared with an abortion procedure, medication abortion is less effective, but the difference is small (procedural abortion is commonly referred to as surgical abortion, even though no there is no incision).", "Some studies suggest that compared with an abortion procedure, medication abortion is associated with a higher rate of adverse events, although the differences are usually small or primarily apply to side effects that are not serious.", "One 2015 paper, analyzing outcomes from more than 50,000 Medicaid patients in California, found that major complications occurred in 0.31% of medication abortions versus 0.16% in procedural abortions.", "A study from Finland, cited in Kacsmaryks ruling, found that total adverse events were nearly four times higher in medication abortions compared with abortion procedures.", "But that was just one finding from the study, which concluded by saying, termination of pregnancy by means of either medical or surgical methods is associated with a low level of serious complications.", "Dr. Oskari Heikinheimo, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Helsinki who was the senior author of the paper, told us that [s]erious complications or serious adverse events were rare and similar after medical or surgical abortion.", "The higher rate of total adverse events, he said, was driven by concerns women had about uterine bleeding.", "Because a procedural abortion removes the pregnancy tissue, while a medication abortion does not, people experience more bleeding with mifepristone, even if its not harmful.", "Another contributing factor, Heikinheimo said, is that abortion is a public health service in Finland, so women had a low threshold of attending medical care, without significant expenses to them and no need to travel long distances.", "He also noted that the study was performed when medication abortion was new to Finland.", "As with the U.S., medication abortion was introduced there in 2000, and the study covered 2000 to 2006.", "Far from thinking his study means medication abortion is unsafe, Heikinheimo said medication abortion has an impressive safety record, even if provided via telemedicine.", "He cited a U.K. study that found no safety or effectiveness concerns with providing medication abortions without an in-person visit or ultrasound.", "Thus, while there are differences between mediation abortion and an abortion procedure that patients should consider, the medical consensus is that both options are safe and effective.", "Indeed, a 2018 review from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that clinical evidence clearly shows that all methods of legal abortion in the U.S., including medication abortions, are safe and effective and that [s]erious complications are rare.", "In emergency applications, the federal government and Danco have appealed the circuit courts order on the preliminary injunction to the Supreme Court.", "The circuit court had set a date of May 17 to hear oral arguments in its review of the District Courts injunction, but whether that happens is subject to what the Supreme Court does.", "Update, April 21: The U.S. Supreme Court, by a 7-2 vote, stayed the lower courts ruling on April 21.", "That means no restrictions on the FDA regulations of mifepristone during the appeals process.", "Eventually, the case would be heard on its merits in the District Court in Texas.", "And that courts final judgment would likely be appealed to the circuit court and ultimately to the Supreme Court.", "That process could take a couple of years.", "Cohen, the law professor at Drexel, told us the FDA could  and should  use its enforcement discretion, meaning it can say it isnt going to enforce particular violations.", "Cohen equated the concept to law enforcement not having the resources to pull over everyone who drives 65 miles per hour in a 55 speed-limit zone, so they have to prioritize their resources.", "Law enforcement agencies are always using enforcement discretion  to say were going to go after the offenses that really matter, he said in a phone interview.", "Similarly with unapproved drugs, the FDA focuses its efforts on drugs that arent effective or safe.", "With mifepristone, the FDA could issue a notice saying it is using its enforcement discretion to not enforce the old requirements.", "This is how the FDA initially allowed mifepristone to be distributed to patients through the mail during the COVID-19 pandemic, when there was concern about in-person office visits.", "We spoke with Cohen before the appeals court ruling, but he said in Twitter posts after that decision that this concept still applies.", "Another option would be for the FDA to expedite a new application for mifepristone, he told us, but thats a lengthy process.", "Yes, in states where abortion is legal.", "(Thirteen states have outlawed abortion, according to the New York Times tracking of such laws.)", "The appeals court said the FDAs 2000 approval could stand, so if the 5th Circuits order goes into effect, the drug would remain on the market as an FDA-approved medication.", "Barring an enforcement discretion notice from the FDA, as Cohen and others advocate, whether some of the pre-2016 restrictions on mifepristone will be followed could depend on the health care provider.", "Under the appeals court ruling, providers could prescribe mifepristone off-label beyond the seven weeks gestation and eliminate extra office visits, Cohen said in a tweet.", "Getting around the in person requirement is trickier, Cohen said.", "Greer Donley, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh and a signatory of an amicus brief in the Texas case, said on Twitter that some telehealth would still be allowed, such as a telehealth appointment between a doctor in a big city and a patient who would pick up the medication from satellite offices in smaller towns.", "And there are the 17 states, plus D.C., that are still under the Washington District Court order.", "The 5th Circuits ruling should not impact anything in the 17 states + DC that are protected by the WA order unless SCOTUS says otherwise, Donley said in another Twitter thread.", "But in the other 33 states, returning to the pre-2016 REMS will be a big deal, she said.", "In-person dispensing would shut down virtual clinics & overwhelm brick-&-mortar clinics.", "Abortion would be harder to access, less private & more expensive.", "Only doctors could prescribe.", "And the Comstock Act language in the appeals court ruling raises the possibility of criminal action against those who ship the pills, at least in a future Republican administration.", "Even if the FDA doesnt issue a statement saying it wont enforcement the pre-2016 requirements, some providers may decide that practically, the FDA is unlikely to target them under [President Joe] Biden, Donley said.", "Also, as the cases move forward, if patients cant get mifepristone, medication abortion can continue by using only misoprostol, which is the protocol used in some other countries.", "There are no lawsuits against misoprostol, Cohen said, and they would be difficult to pursue.", "The drug is FDA-approved to reduce stomach ulcers.", "In addition, a group called Aid Access operates abroad and ships medication abortion pills from pharmacies in India to patients in the United States.", "The pharmaceutical industry and experts in health law have said that a court overruling the FDA approval of a drug would have repercussions beyond the abortion debate, potentially sparking lawsuits challenging other FDA-approved treatments and vaccines.", "If successful, this case could invite copycat lawsuits to limit other forms of politicized health care, Donley, of the University of Pittsburgh, and Rachel Sachs, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and an expert in food and drug regulation, wrote in the Washington Post in early March.", "Potentially at risk would be medications for a much larger range of indications, they said.", "Such a ruling also could affect research and investments in new drugs.", "It could chill innovation nationwide, Donley and Sachs said.", "Manufacturers might become wary of investing time and money into products for a wide range of conditions which may  decades down the line  be the subject of nuisance litigation.", "More than 700 pharmaceutical and biotech industry executives and leaders expressed the same concern in a letter condemning Kacsmaryks April 7 ruling.", "The decision ignores decades of scientific evidence and legal precedent, they wrote.", "Adding regulatory uncertainty to the already inherently risky work of discovering and developing new medicines will likely have the effect of reducing incentives for investment, endangering the innovation that characterizes our industry.", "If courts can overturn drug approvals without regard for science or evidence, or for the complexity required to fully vet the safety and efficacy of new drugs, any medicine is at risk for the same outcome as

truth?", "Between December 2022 and March 31, 30 large whales have been stranded and died on or near the shores of the East Coast, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.", "Twenty-seven have been baleen whales, a type of whale that has baleen plates instead of teeth, including 21 humpbacks that have washed ashore between New York and North Carolina.", "Scientists suspect a variety of factors are behind the whale deaths, which appear to be a continuation of a years-long period of unusually high mortality for marine animals.", "Contrary to claims made by critics of wind energy, there is no indication that the strandings have anything to do with seafloor surveys being done in preparation for the installation of wind turbines.", "The acoustic sources being used in these surveys are either completely out of the hearing range of baleen whales or only capable of slightly disturbing their behavior, an expert told us.", "Regulations also require operators to make sure there are no whales nearby when conducting a survey.", "Theres basically zero chance that those surveys have caused any mortality, Douglas Nowacek, the chair of marine conservation technology at Duke University, told us in a phone interview.", "Despite the lack of evidence, conservative media outlets and others have been spreading such claims on social media for months, with some appropriating the phrase save the whales to express their opposition to wind farms.", "Wind Surveying Is KILLING our Whales, Fox News Jesse Watters wrote on Facebook on Jan. 12, sharing a segment of his show with the same name.", "A day later, during a segment titled, The Biden Whale Extinction, Foxs Tucker Carlson blamed wind farms for killing a huge number of whales.", "He added: This is the DDT of our times, referring to the infamous pesticide that has been banned in the U.S. since 1972.", "The focus on whales comes as many wind projects are being planned, pumped by efforts to achieve the Biden Administrations goal to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030, enough to power 10 million homes.", "The projects have faced pushback from local communities and multiple other hurdles.", "Misinformation campaigns, some from fossil fuel interests, have divided environmentalists and created animosity between some commercial fishermen and those in favor of clean energy.", "In March, Foxs Laura Ingraham continued to push the unfounded narrative.", "These whales that are washing up on our beaches is a direct result of the pre-construction thats taking place here off of New Jersey, a commercial fisherman claimed during an interview, a clip of which was shared on social media.", "The argument is always oil and gas is so bad for the environment, Ingraham replied, how ironic that what theyre doing is almost certainly killing large swaths of the whale population.", "But as well explain, there is no reason to think wind development activities are behind the whale losses.", "I dont think there is a single scientist out there who thinks that these deaths are being caused by wind energy activities, Andrew Read, a marine science and conservation expert also at Duke University, told the Gothamist this month.", "I think the people who are making those claims have other reasons to make those claims.", "The unusual number of dead whales is not new, nor is there evidence its related to the work being done in preparation for the construction of large-scale wind turbine farms, according to three federal agencies and experts.", "The whale mortality observed this winter, officials say, is part of a larger, unexpected and significant die-off of humpbacks, or whats known as an unusual mortality event, that goes back to 2016.", "Since then, 190 stranded humpback whales have been registered along the Atlantic Coast from Maine to Florida.", "The North Atlantic right whale, which is an endangered species, and the minke whale have also been under unusual mortality events, known as UMEs, both starting in 2017.", "Three minke whales and two right whales have been found dead this year; both right whales died with signs of entanglement.", "Vessel strikes and entanglement with fishing gear are two of the biggest hazards for whales.", "According to data from NOAA and the Marine Mammal Stranding Center, a nonprofit that rescues and rehabilitates marine mammals in New Jersey, some recently stranded whales showed signs of strikes and entanglements, although those events could have occurred after death.", "The final necropsy results may be able to clarify the timing.", "About 40% of the necropsies performed in humpbacks in the ongoing UME that started in 2016 show evidence of a ship strike or rope entanglement, according to NOAA.", "The causes for the other 60% have been inconclusive, in part, officials say, because the carcasses decompose quickly, making it difficult to determine a cause of death.", "Partial or full necropsies were possible in only half of those humpback cases.", "Examinations are often not possible because the corpses are inaccessible, have decomposed, or require lots of people and equipment.", "Vessel strikes and entanglement are also the leading causes of mortality and serious injuries in the right whale UME.", "Several factors, experts and officials have said, could be increasing the risk of these hazards.", "For one, climate change is warming oceans and changing the distribution of prey that marine species depend on.", "As a result, whales are altering their migration routes and moving out of protected areas and closer to the shores, where they are more vulnerable to ship strikes and entanglement with fishing gear.", "Humpback populations are also growing, so there are more of them everywhere.", "Shipping activity has also increased, particularly recently.", "According to the Port Authority, in 2022, the ports of New York and New Jersey moved a record-high annual cargo total, with 27 percent growth over pre-pandemic 2019.", "As the humpback whale population has grown, their occurrence in the mid-Atlantic has increased, a NOAA Fisheries representative explained in a media briefing on Jan. 18.", "These whales may be following their prey, which were hearing from our partners in the region are reportedly close to shore this winter.", "More whales in the water and traveled areas by boats of all sizes increases the risk of vessel strikes.", "NOAA has said that to date, no whale death has been attributed to offshore wind activities.", "I have not heard of any injuries or damage caused by offshore wind energy development, Michael J. Moore, senior scientist and director of the marine mammal center at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, told us in an email.", "The Marine Mammal Commission, an independent governmental agency whose mission is to protect marine mammals, confirmed what other agencies have said in a Feb. 21 statement: Despite several reports in the media, there is no evidence to link these strandings to offshore wind energy development.", "Currently, in the U.S., there are two operating offshore wind projects, in Rhode Island and Virginia Beach, and two projects under construction, in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.", "No construction activities have occurred offshore New Jersey, where many of the whales have washed up.", "Nor has the Department of Interiors Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which manages offshore renewable energy developments, approved any construction and operations plans for offshore wind in that state yet, according to an email sent to FactCheck.org by the agency and a statement by the states Department of Environmental Protection.", "Instead, most of the offshore wind activity taking place on the Atlantic Coast right now, including in New Jersey, is related to data collection.", "According to BOEM, that includes surveys to understand the geology of the locations where wind turbines may be installed and surveys to identify marine-protected species, shipwrecks, archeological sites and habitats.", "To map the seafloor, wind farm developers typically use high-resolution geophysical, or HRG, surveys, which use different kinds of sound systems, or acoustic sources.", "Some of these could affect whale behavior, but they are not known to lead to deaths.", "I just want to be unambiguous, Benjamin Laws, deputy chief for the permits and conservation division at NOAA Fisheries, said in the Jan. 18 media briefing.", "There is no information that would support any suggestion that any of the equipment thats being used in support of wind development for these site characterization surveys could directly lead to the death of a whale.", "Much of the surveying uses very high frequency sources, which allow for high-resolution mapping and are used to detect corridors for electricity cables, Nowacek said.", "The sound gets absorbed quickly by the water, he said, and is way out of the range of hearing of baleen whales  and even beyond the hearing of some dolphins and porpoises.", "Other HRG sources, such as sparkers and boomers, use lower frequencies that are in the hearing range of whales.", "But as BOEM bioacoustician Erica Staaterman explained during the media briefing, these sources are very different from the seismic air guns used by the oil and gas industry, which are designed to penetrate deep into the seafloor and are therefore very high-energy and very loud.", "The lower frequency sources used for wind farms dont need to penetrate as deep, since theyre just used to locate an area to build the turbines, Nowacek said.", "As a result, they use less energy, for shorter periods of time and in smaller areas, using more narrow sound beams.", "Nowacek said a whale would have to be literally right underneath to be impacted.", "And thats very unlikely, since operators must abide by a series of stringent mitigation protocols set by NOAA, as we will explain later.", "And even then, the impact wouldnt be lethal, he said.", "They may move, they may be displaced, they may, you know, change their swimming patterns, they may change their vocal behavior, he said of the whales.", "But its not going to kill them.", "BOEM and NOAA Fisheries rigorously assessed the potential effects of HRG surveys associated with offshore wind development in the Atlantic, and the agencies concluded that these types of surveys are not likely to injure whales or other endangered species, BOEM told us in an email.", "Laws also noted that the acoustic systems used for surveying are commonly used around the world, and there are no historical stranding events that have been associated with use of systems like these.", "Also arguing against any connection between the surveys and the whale deaths is the fact that these surveys have been occurring for decades.", "Federal, state and academic institutions began doing offshore wind energy-related surveys before 2010, BOEM told us in an email.", "Surveys by developers started in 2011 in Delaware and in 2015 in New Jersey.", "And before any offshore wind development, similar surveys took place for scientific research.", "As we said, there is no evidence whale and other marine mammal mortality has been caused by offshore wind development.", "However, experts and officials acknowledge these projects have potential risks to whales, including those associated with increased noise, vessel traffic and entanglement, and are working to mitigate them.", "The exploration, construction, and operation of offshore wind energy is not risk neutral for marine mammals, Moore, Woods Holes marine mammal center director, told us in an email.", "Whales and other species are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act.", "To do acoustic surveys or to do any other activity other than fishing that could potentially disturb or harm marine mammals, wind operators and others need to get what is called an incidental take authorization.", "Projects that have the potential for serious injuries or deaths of marine mammals, such as some military exercises and oil and gas activities, require a Letter of Authorization.", "None of those have been issued for wind energy.", "NOAA Fisheries has not authorized (or proposed to authorize) mortality or serious injury of whales for any wind-related action, the agency told us in an email.", "Instead, the concern with wind farms is what the Marine Mammal Protection Act calls harassment, which is defined on two levels: Level A, which means the activities have the potential to produce a non-serious injury to marine mammals; and level B, which means the work has the potential to produce a behavioral disturbance.", "Currently, there are several active incidental take authorizations for offshore wind, but only two include both level A and B harassment.", "Laws said during the briefing that for the site characterizations surveys, only behavioral disturbance, or level B harassment, has been authorized.", "A series of other protective measures are in place to minimize the risks of offshore wind activities, such as slow zones for vessels to avoid collisions (less than 10 knots, or 11.5 miles per hour) and exclusion areas, places where surveys are not allowed to occur for certain periods of time.", "Operators must also have at least one independent protected species observer on duty at all times during the day, and at least two at night, to detect protected species and avoid any contact.", "Surveys cant be conducted if an endangered marine mammal, such as a right whale, is closer than 1,640 feet from the vessel, or if any other marine mammal is closer than 328 feet.", "If a whale is found to be approaching what is known as the shutdown zone, the surveying must stop until the animal moves out of the area.", "Mitigations for level A harassment, which is anticipated with pile driving activities when turbines are installed, are more stringent.", "Each project has its own set of mitigations, but these include sound attenuating systems, seasonal restrictions when pile driving is not allowed, and larger clearance zones (3,280 feet for right whales and 1,640 feet for other baleen whales).", "A less understood potential issue posed by offshore wind development is the potential impact of the turbine towers on the dynamics and ecology of surface waters, which are rich in food sources for fish and whales.", "According to a study published in 2022, offshore wind infrastructure in the deeper ocean could disturb the seasonal cycles of ocean stratification, which could impact zooplankton, the tiny animals that are a crucial food source for baleen whales.", "The study says this could have both negative and positive effects, and that more studies are needed to identify them and mitigate or maximize them accordingly.", "Some of those issues are addressed in a draft strategy proposed by NOAA and BOEM to protect and promote the recovery of North Atlantic right whales while responsibly developing offshore wind energy, NOAA told us in an email.", "One of the biggest challenges for whale conservation is to keep protection measures current, Moore said.", "Because of climate change, he said, it is becoming more difficult to predict where whales will be at a certain time of the year, since their food sources are moving due to changes in the seawater temperature.", "As a result, whales end up in places with no protections.", "Obviously, we need to mitigate and reverse climate disruption, he wrote.", "And offshore wind energy is one of the solutions.", "Thus, we need to

pal-i-VIZ-oo-mab), with the brand name Synagis (SIN-uh-jis), is administered monthly during the RSV season, typically for five months.", "It was approved by the FDA in 1998, after a clinical trial showed a 55% risk reduction for RSV-associated hospitalization for infants who were born prematurely or children with chronic lung disease.", "The idea of giving palivizumab to all infants never had any real traction, Dr. William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and also a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told us.", "The level of effectiveness of the drug is beneficial to high-risk children, but it wasnt sufficient, particularly when the treatment required multiple injections, to give to all infants.", "Preterm infants are also at the highest risk of developing bronchiolitis or a very severe RSV infection, he said.", "Nirsevimab appears to be more effective in reducing hospitalization, even in full-term infants  more on this below  and only requires one injection.", "Schaffner noted that while the drug manufacturers hope nirsevimab will be offered universally to all infants, it remains to be seen what recommendations the CDCs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics will make to pediatricians.", "On Feb. 23, a maternal/pediatric RSV work group for the CDCs ACIP presented its findings on nirsevimab, saying the work group would recommend the antibody for all infants in their first RSV season  at

is 39 weeks.", "Those preterm birth rates are below the global background rate of about 10%.", "These figures vary by country, with 5% to 18% of births occurring preterm, according to the World Health Organization.", "In a presentation at the February conference, Ilse Dieussaert, GSKs vice president of vaccine development, said that the safety signal was observed in one clinical trial but not in others GSK was conducting for the RSV vaccine in pregnant women.", "She noted that the imbalance in neonatal deaths was only present for preterm births, not births that occurred at 37 weeks or later.", "Additionally, Dieussaert said, based the clinical information on each of the neonatal deaths, we concluded that the events leading to the death of the infants are those that are most commonly observed in premature babies and the complications of being born prematurely.", "So, the neonatal death imbalance is considered to be a consequence of the preterm imbalance and is not considered to be an independent safety signal.", "The GSK spokesperson also said the investigation doesnt affect the phase 3 trial for the older adult RSV vaccine.", "In a statement sent to

in the vaccine group, 52, was similar to that in the placebo group, 49.", "Within one month of vaccination, there was an imbalance in atrial fibrillation events, or irregular heartbeat  10 in the vaccine group and four in the placebo.", "The trial investigators didnt consider any of those to be related to the vaccine.", "The FDA is reviewing those cases.", "In an earlier, small trial in which some participants received the RSV vaccine and an influenza vaccine at the same time, Pfizer saw a trend in decreased [immune] responses to the flu vaccine, Gurtman said.", "The company is studying this in a larger trial.", "GSK.", "The company said the data show the vaccine was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile.", "Pain at the injection site was the most common side effect reported; nearly 61% of a subset of participants who were solicited for such feedback reported injection-site pain.", "Fatigue, muscle aches, headache and joint stiffness were also reported at rates higher than the placebo group.", "Fatalities were balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups.", "There was one case of Guillain-Barr syndrome nine days after vaccination that was considered to be related to vaccination by the FDA and the study investigator, the FDA briefing document on the vaccine said.", "That would be a rate of 1 per 15,000 people.", "And there were two cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or ADEM, a neurological disorder involving swelling in the brain and spinal cord, both in 71-year-olds in a smaller phase 3 trial, with 890 participants, studying co-administration with the flu vaccine.", "In one of those cases, a man experienced symptoms seven days after vaccination and later died.", "The other case was a woman who experienced symptoms 22 days after vaccination and recovered.", "The study investigator said the cases were possibly related to the flu vaccine, and the FDA considered them to be possibly related to either the flu or the GSK vaccine.", "There was also an imbalance in atrial fibrillation within 30 days of vaccination, with 10 cases in the vaccine group and four in the placebo.", "Dr. Peggy Webster, vice president and head of vaccine safety at GSK, said during the VRBPAC meeting that six of the cases in the vaccine group and two in placebo were in people with a history of the condition.", "As with the Pfizer vaccine, the FDA is reviewing those cases.", "The FDA and the study investigator considered six other cases of potential immune-mediated diseases to be possibly related to the vaccine: gout, pancytopenia, Bells palsy, psoriasis and Graves disease.", "There was also a case of gout in the co-administration study, possibly related to the flu or GSKs RSV vaccine, FDA said.", "In the co-administration study, there is no evidence for interference in immune responses to the flu and GSK vaccine, FDA said.", "VRBPACs vote: Pfizer.", "The VRBPAC vote on the Pfizer vaccine was 7-4, with one abstention, that the data supported the safety of the vaccine  but with only one committee member, Hofstra Universitys Bernstein, voting no on both efficacy and safety.", "Those who voted yes said the available data show the vaccine is safe, and more information on Guillain-Barr wouldnt come through the clinical trial, but rather though post-approval surveillance, which would involve a lot more people getting the vaccine.", "The FDA has requested that Pfizer develop such a follow-up study.", "Some said that a potential co-administration issue with the flu vaccine was an implementation issue, not a safety issue for this vaccine.", "The four no votes were concerned about Guillain-Barr and not having more data on co-administration with the flu vaccine.", "Griffin, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, talked about safety in terms of benefit versus risk.", "She said she would be less concerned about the safety signal in a population that had a very high hospitalization risk, but that population was underrepresented in the trial.", "Given the Guillain-Barr concern, she said, the benefit for relatively healthy older people  is not that great, compared to a possible high risk of a very severe outcome.", "Dr. Daniel Feikin, a respiratory disease consultant and a yes vote, said a Guillain-Barr safety signal is potentially there.", "But there were only two cases, which had a potential other explanation for GBS.", "Like other committee members, he said he didnt think more data on this would be available except through a post-marketing, meaning after approval, follow-up study.", "While the phase 3 trial is following participants for two RSV seasons, the vaccination is only given before the first season.", "Some of the experts expressed concern about potential vaccine hesitancy among the public, given the experience with the COVID-19 vaccines, particularly vaccination rates with the booster shots.", "Portnoy, who voted yes on the safety question, said before the vote: I think we have to be really careful before we send the vaccine out to cover large groups of patients given the hesitancy that occurred surrounding COVID vaccine, which turned out to be a very safe vaccine.", "VRBPACs vote: GSK.", "The committee voted 10-2 that the data supported the safety of the vaccine.", "Dr. Hana El Sahly, chair of the committee and a professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine, and Griffin voted no due to concern over the ADEM and Guillain-Barr case rates.", "El Sahly said the inflammatory neurologic diagnoses do rise above the average seen, and while she agrees that post-marketing surveillance can help answer whether this is a true safety signal, once a vaccine is licensed it is really hard to collect data given our decentralized health care delivery system.", "Pre-licensure is probably where most of the effort should go when feasible.", "Griffin said the ADEM and GBS cases, versus two hospitalizations in the placebo group, made it hard to weigh the risks and benefits, and she also wanted to see more data on co-administering the vaccine with the flu vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine, since thats likely the way vaccination would be done in the public.", "Perlman, who abstained on this question for Pfizer, said he was a little more convinced on the safety of the GSK vaccine, noting there was only one case of Guillain-Barr and that both ADEM cases occurred in South Africa among about 150 participants, raising questions about whether those were due to vaccination.", "Bernstein, who had voted no on both questions for the Pfizer vaccine, also said its just not clear whether or not theres a true safety signal with ADEM or atrial fibrillation and that post-marketing surveillance would be helpful in that regard.", "He added that he doesnt think the vaccine needs to be rushed to market, if in fact its at the expense of the older population getting flu and COVID-19 shots.", "Its too soon to say.", "The Pfizer and GSK clinical trials dont yet have data through a second RSV season to answer the question of how long vaccination would provide protection  though the VRBPAC members talked about it potentially being an annual vaccine, like the flu shot.", "After the FDA approves vaccines for use, the CDC, drawing upon recommendations from its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, issues guidelines on who should get the vaccines and how frequently.", "However, RSV work groups, which include ACIP members, presented the available data on the Pfizer and GSK vaccines and information on RSV in a late February ACIP meeting.", "The work groups make recommendations to the entire ACIP, but then the work groups do not vote on the final guidance.", "The majority opinion of the adult RSV work group was that both vaccines should be recommended for those 65 and older, but not those 60 to 64.", "Also, there was a substantial minority opinion not to recommend the vaccines based on the available data, the CDCs Dr. Michael Melgar, the lead of the adult RSV work group, said, due to concern about risk-benefit balance and underrepresentation in the trials of adults older than 80 who are most at risk of severe illness from RSV.", "A CDC spokesperson, Katherina Grusich, told us in an email that [n]o votes were taken, at the February ACIP meeting, but the discussion  which included robust deliberation around available safety, cost and effectiveness data, and potential clinical considerations  will help inform future ACIP policy recommendations if the vaccines are approved by the

referenced the claim that the grant was some form of quid pro quo in his written testimony.", "Wades written testimony prompted Jordan to ask him why he thought the scientists changed their position.", "After initially saying, I dont know what the reason was, Wade said, If youre looking at the timeline, on May 21, just a few weeks after the Nature Medicine article had come out, two of the signatories of the original email to Dr. Fauci  thats Dr. Andersen and Dr. Garry  were awarded a $9 million grant.", "So theres 9 million reasons why they changed their mind, Jordan interrupted.",

application to establish the West African Research Network for Infectious Diseases, a coalition of scientists in Africa and the U.S. who are researching infectious agents and creating new testing technology to mitigate the effects of future pandemic threats.", "The deadline for submitting the application was June 28, 2019.", "To decide whether to fund grants, the NIAID recruits panels of scientists to review their peers applications and give them scores, which are translated into an overall impact score between 10 and 90, with 10 being the best.", "The meeting to review applications for the grant took place in November 2019.", "Garry told us that the grant application received an impact score of 27  meaning the reviewers considered the project to be of high impact, according to NIAID scoring criteria.", "Your overall impact score is the key review outcome, the main basis for a funding decision by an NIH Institute, the NIAID website reads.", "The next step is review before an advisory council, a group of experts and lay members that looks at applications with potential barriers to funding such as human subjects and animal concerns, or special circumstances such as foreign applications and renewal applications requesting more money than the limit, according to the NIAID website.", "NIAID calls this second-level review a small step after the hurdle of initial peer review.", "The advisory council for the grant met in January 2020.", "The advisory council made a funding recommendation for the grant prior to the Feb. 1 call, Garry told us, which was also confirmed by Fauci in his Fox News interview.", "Once a grant has been recommended for funding, the NIAID website explains, NIAID makes the final decision on whether a grant will be awarded, with potential obstacles to funding including having a score below a certain level or not meeting administrative requirements.", "Administrative requirements can include things like providing additional information

the coronavirus.", "But the primary conclusion of the review is that its uncertain from randomized controlled trials whether mask interventions in the community help slow the spread of respiratory illnesses."], "paragraphs": ["Three years into the COVID-19 pandemic, few topics have become as polarizing as masks.", "Some people claim masks are a panacea; others say masks are worthless or worse.", "The evidence, however, is more complicated and nuanced  and points somewhere in between, experts told us.", "Reigniting the debate  and sparking misinformation about masks from both sides  is a recently released update from Cochrane, a highly-respected British nonprofit that specializes in systematic reviews of health care interventions.", "The Jan. 30 review found that based on existing randomized controlled trials  which tested the effectiveness of interventions encouraging people to wear masks, rather than testing the effectiveness of masks themselves  wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people with influenza or COVID-19-like illnesses.", "The pooled results of RCTs did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with the use of medical/surgical masks, the review reads.", "The authors, however, also emphasized the uncertainty about the effects of face masks.", "And only two trials in the review assessed the effectiveness of a mask intervention for COVID-19.", "The high risk of bias in the trials, variation in outcome measurement, and relatively low adherence with the interventions during the studies hampers drawing firm conclusions, the authors wrote.", "The low to moderate certainty of evidence means our confidence in the effect estimate is limited, and that the true effect may be different from the observed estimate of the effect.", "In other words, there isnt good evidence from randomized controlled trials that encouraging mask use in the community prevents the spread of respiratory diseases, but the issue also hasnt been studied very well.", "So the real answer is unknown.", "Despite the limitations, many people misinterpreted the review to be saying that masks dont work.", "12 RESEARCH STUDIES PROVE MASKS DIDNT WORK, reads an Instagram post about the Cochrane review from the Liberty Counsel, a Christian religious liberty organization.", "Scientific review confirms doubters stance on masks and COVID-19, declared a popular Instagram post from Fox News.", "The lead author of the Cochrane review, Tom Jefferson, seemed to endorse this interpretation when he said in an interview, later quoted by conservative columnist Bret Stephens in a widely viewed opinion piece for the New York Times, There is just no evidence that they  referring to masks  make any difference.", "But experts  and the Cochrane Library  say this is an inaccurate representation of what the review found.", "Many commentators have claimed that a recently-updated Cochrane Review shows that masks dont work, which is an inaccurate and misleading interpretation, Dr. Karla Soares-Weiser, the editor-in-chief of the Cochrane Library, said in a March 10 statement.", "It would be accurate to say that the review examined whether interventions to promote mask wearing help to slow the spread of respiratory viruses, and that the results were inconclusive, she continued.", "Given the limitations in the primary evidence, the review is not able to address the question of whether mask-wearing itself reduces peoples risk of contracting or spreading respiratory viruses.", "Soares-Weiser went on to note some limitations mentioned in the abstract of the review, including the issue of whether people in the trials actually wore masks.", "She said the group would be working with the authors to reword the Plain Language Summary, which she said was open to misinterpretation.", "In an interview with the New York Times, Soares-Weiser was also critical of Jeffersons comments, which she said were not accurate.", "Jefferson, who is a senior associate tutor of continuing education at Oxford University, has been the lead author of the Cochrane review on physical interventions to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses since its inception in 2006.", "He has endorsed several unorthodox views about COVID-19 and some of his writing has been republished by the Brownstone Institute, a group that has described itself as the spiritual child of the widely criticized Great Barrington Declaration.", "In the latest update to the Cochrane review, under a section in which authors disclosed potential conflicts of interest, he reported declaring an opinion on the topic of the review in articles for popular media.", "One reason the Cochrane review has garnered so much attention is because Cochrane has a reputation for excellence.", "The group doesnt do original research, but performs what are called systematic reviews, which summarize the collective literature on a particular question in a careful and predetermined way that minimizes bias.", "This prevents someone from cherry-picking studies that could sway the findings, for example.", "The results from different studies are often then combined statistically in what is called a meta-analysis, which uses a weighted average to summarize the effectiveness of a given intervention.", "Cochrane is particularly known for its robust and transparent methods and is therefore often considered to be the gold standard for such reviews.", "In this case, the review focused not just on mask interventions, but on physical interventions more broadly, including hand hygiene programs, for the prevention of respiratory illnesses, primarily influenza.", "Similar to a 2020 update on this topic, but in contrast to earlier editions, the systematic review did not consider observational studies about masks, and instead was limited to randomized controlled trials and cluster randomized controlled trials.", "Randomized controlled trials are considered one of the best kinds of evidence, since they randomly assign people to an intervention or control group, or in the case of a cluster design, randomly assign groups of people to different interventions.", "This allows for a fairer comparison of what the intervention actually does, although every study has some limitations.", "The 2023 update added 11 new randomized controlled trials, for a total of 78 trials.", "But only about a dozen of these evaluated the effect of a mask intervention, such as providing people with a mask and encouraging them to wear it, compared with no such intervention, on the number of respiratory illnesses.", "And only two were conducted during the pandemic for the coronavirus.", "Five other trials, none of which were done for the coronavirus, compared N95 or other similar respirators with surgical masks, mostly in health care workers.", "Despite some claims to the contrary, including a now-deleted Twitter thread that incorrectly alleged the Cochrane authors made errors in their meta-analysis, multiple experts told us the review did not have any notable flaws.", "It is a well done review.", "Its been done tightly by the best standards by competent people, Julii Brainard, a senior research associate at Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia in the U.K., told us.", "It may seem very critical of primary evidence, but Cochrane reviews are always very critical.", "The review itself is pretty standard for Cochrane, Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist from the University of Wollongong in Australia, said in an email, adding that it is of a similar quality to most Cochrane reviews  I cannot find any major errors in the process.", "But some experts objected to some of the language the authors used to summarize their results and took issue with certain decisions and interpretations of the review.", "All agreed that it was incorrect to conclude that the review shows masks dont work.", "Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong who has studied masks, said he thought the review was very similar to other systematic reviews on the topic.", "But he found the authors conclusion that wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to be problematic.", "He noted that the confidence intervals for the meta-analysis for unconfirmed and lab-confirmed influenza and COVID-19 go down as low as 0.84 and 0.72, and said that these effects (16% reduction and 28% reduction, respectively) would not be considered little or no difference.", "Cowling has long said that community masking could reduce transmission by around 10% to 20%  a small to moderate effect which is worthwhile, he said, and views the Cochrane review as completely consistent with that.", "Meyerowitz-Katz also didnt think the wording in the review was entirely reasonable, adding that one of the review authors told him the group had debated the phrasing.", "Specifically I think they should have downgraded the certainty from may or probably to very low certainty language, because they are combining influenza with COVID-19, he said.", "This is, of course, a bit subjective both on my part and theirs, but its important.", "One criticism about the review is that it combined results from flu and COVID-19 studies.", "Only two of the 12 main studies on masks were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Meyerowitz-Katz said the entire purpose of running this review was to determine whether mask interventions were effective in preventing COVID-19 in communities, and it basically found there wasnt much research examining that.", "So why do the review at all?", "he said.", "It was reasonable to look at evidence on other respiratory viruses at the beginning of the pandemic when we didnt have evidence on SARS-CoV-2, Dr. Roger Chou, a professor of medical informatics and clinical epidemiology at Oregon Health & Science University, said, referring to the virus that causes COVID-19.", "But now that we have evidence on SARS-CoV-2, I dont think that is the best approach.", "And looking at the COVID-19-specific studies, the findings are still uncertain, but lean toward a small protective effect, several experts said.", "A cluster randomized controlled trial published in the journal Science in December 2021 found that handing out free masks and promoting their use in communities in rural Bangladesh led to a nearly 30 percentage point increase in mask wearing and reduced the risk of COVID-19-like illness by about 10%.", "A randomized controlled trial from Denmark, published in Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, identified an 18% reduction in risk of coronavirus infection among individuals who received free surgical masks and were told to wear them outside the home, but this result was not statistically significant.", "Weve explained before that the trial was only designed to detect a large effect of 50% or more.", "Taken together, these two RCTs are consistent with a small reduction in risk, Chou said.", "The trials are not perfect, but it is very challenging to do these studies and I havent seen anything to invalidate the results of the studies.", "Chou, who is an expert in evidence-based medicine and has co-authored a rapid review about the effectiveness of mask interventions, also said that both trials might have underestimated the benefits of masks.", "In the Bangladesh trial, for example, less than half of the people in the intervention arm wore masks, and with higher adherence the benefits might have been greater, he said.", "He added that the Danish trial wasnt designed to see whether masks helped prevent those who were wearing masks from spreading COVID-19, or what is known as source control, so it may not have captured the true value of masks.", "Meyerowitz-Katz noted that since the cutoff for consideration with the Cochrane review, a third randomized controlled trial on masks during the pandemic has been released as an unpublished preprint.", "Aggregating the three studies together, he said, they show a consistent and fairly convincing effect.", "To me, this shows that there is a reasonably clear modest benefit to community masking interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic, decreasing the rate of infections in groups of people who are given masks and told to wear them by ~13%, he said.", "Thats quite an important benefit in the context of a pandemic.", "Brainard, however, who is an expert on systematic reviews and published a review of the evidence on masks earlier in the pandemic, thought it was reasonable to group the influenza and COVID-19 studies together.", "She nevertheless agreed that the primary message of the review should be one of uncertainty.", "I cant argue with the Authors own written conclusions: the evidence quality is variable and creates a huge amount of uncertainties, she said in an email.", "We cant tell from available evidence that masks prevented infections according to our usual standards, which is 95% confidence that protection was achieved.", "Thats different from saying that masks dont work for community spread or for an individual.", "And its also different, she said, from saying that mask mandates dont work, since in trials mask-wearing is voluntary, rather than being required for everyone in the community.", "It is lamentable that during [the] pandemic not enough RCTs were done to [have] better evidence what NPIs work or not, she said, referring to non-pharmaceutical interventions.", "One point of confusion for many people is that lab studies show masks, mostly well-fitting and high-filtering N95 respirators, are good at blocking viral particles.", "This is evidence that masks can in theory be quite effective, both for individuals and for larger populations.", "Some scientists have pushed for people to use better masks, especially N95 respirators, if people truly want their masks to work.", "But as weve explained before, this mechanistic evidence doesnt necessarily mean that when public health officials recommend masks that this intervention will work to limit spread in the community.", "Showing that N95s stop particles in mannequins only proves that they can plausibly help, but if people hate wearing them, or dont wear them properly, or only have access to cloth masks, etc, then the actual intervention will not be as effective, Meyerowitz-Katz said.", "Many observational studies have been done to try to understand what masks or mask interventions do, and Chou said they have generally found masks to be associated with reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2.", "But they have major limitations, he said, since its hard to know if masking is the reason for the differences between groups.", "Still, Chou said that overall, this other evidence outside of randomized controlled trials supports some benefits of masks.", "I think the evidence indicates that masks likely have small benefits for individuals in preventing COVID-19 (~15% reduction), though with only two RCTs more evidence would of course be helpful for clarifying the benefits, he said.", "Even if the benefits are small for an individual, they are still important when considered from a population/public health perspective, Chou added.", "Brainard suspects that masks may not make as much of a difference as people may have hoped at the beginning of the pandemic.", "Surgical masks probably help prevent respiratory infections, she said, but only a little  and by delaying infection rather than fully preventing it.", "Many people hate wearing masks, including people who believe that masks are truly very protective.", "Any intervention that must be sustained for long periods but people find difficult to sustain is not a great intervention, she said.", "But even if it turns out that mask recommendations dont do very much, that doesnt mean it was wrong to try them.", "Buying time until vaccines (or an amazing treatment) could be developed was the purpose of the masks, she said.", "My take is that public health officials in 2020-21 didnt have a lot of options: without an effective vaccine, yet they couldnt make people stay at home forever.", "Masks were a reasonable thing to try.", "Cowling agreed that the main function of masks is to delay infection, and that people should have realistic expectations for them.", "Ultimately even a very careful person will be infected eventually, but masks could delay that or reduce the rate of infection from once per year to once every few years, perhaps, he said.", "Community masking is not aimed to prevent everyone from ever getting infected, the aim is to reduce transmission and flatten the curve, reducing peak healthcare demand, or to work in combination with other measures like social distancing to contain transmission in the short-term.", "Editors note: SciChecks articles providing accurate health information and correcting

which some evidence suggests is stronger than either immunity from infection or vaccination alone.", "Third, COVID-19 disease and vaccination are fundamentally not comparable in certain ways.", "COVID-19 is a disease that has killed at least 6.8 million people, including more than 1.1 million Americans, and sickened many more.", "Vaccination is a safe tool people can use to reduce risk of severe disease.", "Vaccines, of course, remain the safest way to acquire immunity, whereas acquiring natural immunity must be weighed against the risks of severe illness and death associated with the initial infection, Lim said, echoing a similar statement made in his paper.", "The Lancet paper is a systematic review and meta-analysis, which means the authors searched for previously published studies that measured protection from COVID-19 in people who had been infected and people who had not and then combined data from the papers to estimate protection.", "They found 65 studies from 19 countries, concluding that protection against re-infection was high when measuring reinfections with the earlier COVID-19 variants: the original virus, as well as the alpha, beta and delta versions.", "Protection against reinfection with omicron BA.1  the first omicron variant  was substantially lower.", "Over time, protection from reinfection decreased for all variants but decreased more quickly with the arrival of omicron.", "Using data from the 30 studies that included information on time since infection, the authors estimated that at four weeks after infection, protection from the ancestral, alpha and delta variants was around 85%, falling to a little under 79% by 40 weeks after infection.", "Protection against reinfection with the omicron BA.1 variant was 74% at four weeks and around 36% by 40 weeks.", "It makes sense that protection from reinfection would decline with the arrival of omicron, since it was more immune evasive and more transmissible than prior variants.", "Only a few studies included in the meta-analysis looked at protection against reinfection with omicron subvariants that came after BA.1, and none looked at the currently circulating XBB.1.5, making it more difficult to draw conclusions about current protection.", "However, based on data from a small number of studies, protection from reinfection with omicron variants was higher if someone had a prior infection with omicron, rather than a pre-omicron variant.", "Protection against hospitalization or death at 40 weeks remained high regardless of variant.", "Infection reduced risk of severe disease by nearly 89% for omicron BA.1 and a little over 90% for ancestral, alpha and delta.", "The primary focus of the new Lancet paper was to compare protection from past infection versus no past infection, Lim said.", "He and his colleagues plan to submit a separate paper soon that elaborates on the comparison between vaccines and past infection.", "Lim told us that he and his co-authors concluded that past infection was at least as protective as the best mRNA vaccines, not that it was more protective.", "This is due to uncertainty in their estimates for the protection provided by each, he explained.", "Based on the data included in our review, there is insufficient data to definitively state that there is a numerical advantage of past infection against the best mRNA vaccines, Lim said.", "Some posts and articles overstate the weakness of vaccine-induced immunity.", "A widely shared Defender article, for example, led to a post inaccurately claiming that #COVID vaxx makes you MORE likely to get COVID.", "As we have written, this is incorrect.", "The Defender article cites a graph comparing vaccine effectiveness after three vaccine doses versus two doses but incorrectly interprets it as showing vaccine-acquired immunity eventually became negative.", "The Defender is a publication of Childrens Health Defense, an organization run by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that has previously spread vaccine misinformation.", "Alejandro Balazs, an immunologist at the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, told us in an email that vaccine effectiveness varies significantly depending on the variants circulating and a persons particular history of COVID-19, including whether they were infected and when this happened in relation to vaccination.", "Because of these factors, discussion of whether natural immunity is better than vaccines requires a level of nuance which is rarely discussed, he said.", "Regardless of which type of immunity is better or more durable, there is evidence that vaccines benefit people who have already had COVID-19.", "Lim, Balazs and Daniela Weiskopf, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, all said that the Lancet researchers didnt assess immunity in people who have gotten some combination of vaccines and infections.", "A review study published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases in January 2023 looked at protection against the omicron variant, comparing hybrid immunity to immunity following vaccination alone or infection alone.", "Hybrid immunity provided the strongest and most lasting protection against hospital admission or severe disease.", "Weiskopf also said that while infection does appear to generally provide protection, there remains a small group of people who do not mount a durable immune response.", "It is difficult to predict who might fall into that group.", "Lim said that people making decisions about primary vaccines and boosters must take into account individuals risks and those of their close contacts.", "For example, risk of severe disease increases dramatically with older individuals as well as those with comorbidities, e.g.", "those who are immunocompromised.", "Vaccines provide an important immunity boost for these high-risk populations, Lim said.", "He added that vaccines are also important for people who have not had COVID-19 before, those who were infected with a variant prior to omicron, and those who regularly spend time with people at high risk.", "Posts and commentators discussing immunity after infection often leave out the dangers of COVID-19 infection, or misleadingly imply that COVID-19 vaccines are unsafe.", "Speaking during a segment on Fox News that mentioned the new Lancet paper, Dr. Scott Atlas said people previously infected with COVID-19 have biological protection that is better, not just equal, better as proven by the data from the vaccine.", "Atlas, a neuroradiologist who was a member of former President Donald Trumps coronavirus task force and has previously spread misinformation about COVID-19, continued, The vaccine has side effects.", "We still dont have a real, accurate assessment of the side effects even though weve had 5 or 6 billion doses.", "You have to wonder why that is.", "COVID-19 vaccine side effects are mild and temporary in the vast majority of cases, and some people have no side effects.", "Common side effects include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain and pain at the injection site.", "Vaccine safety monitoring systems have detected only rare cases of serious side effects.", "In contrast, COVID-19 infection can result in death or long-term medical issues, including heart and lung problems.", "I do not think that immunity from infection is superior based on the evidence, Balazs said, adding that there are considerable risks associated with COVID-19 infection, particularly in vulnerable populations.", "Side-effects from vaccines are rare as compared to health risks from COVID-19.", "We know that vaccinations are increasing your antibody levels and your T cell levels without the risk of you getting sick, Weiskopf said.", "Many social media posts and articles have focused on the idea that someone  be that the media, government or public health officials, or some unspecified group  has omitted or suppressed information about immunity after infection.", "Widely shared posts also include natural immunity on a long list of topics they got wrong and declare WE WERE RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!", "The idea that infection provides substantial protection from future COVID-19 is not new.", "Scientists have been publishing the available evidence on immunity following COVID-19 since 2020, although early on there was uncertainty about the duration and reliability of this protection.", "Major media outlets have covered these findings.", "Weiskopf pointed out that as a meta-analysis, the new Lancet study itself only draws on previous studies, meaning the data underlying its conclusions were already available.", "The National Institutes of Health has promoted research it helped fund looking at immunity after infection, including research that looked into the question of whether previously infected people needed one or two primary COVID-19 vaccine doses.", "The CDC has also previously reviewed the strengths of immunity after infection, noting the protection afforded by prior infection while also emphasizing the benefits of hybrid immunity.", "Its true that the CDC has not always accounted for past infection in its guidance.", "Some experts have criticized the agency for this.", "But its also important to recognize that early on, there was limited data on how protective immunity after infection would be, and other coronaviruses, such as those that cause colds, did not provoke long-lasting protection against reinfection.", "Given the uncertainties, and the possibility that some subset of people would not be very well protected, health authorities encouraged vaccination even for those who were previously infected.", "The agency stated in early 2021, Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that re-infection with COVID-19 is possible, vaccine should be offered to you regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 infection, explaining that it was unknown how long protection after COVID-19 would last and that immunity can vary from person to person.", "And for a while, both vaccination and previous infection were quite good at preventing not just severe disease, but another infection.", "Then, with the arrival of the delta variant  and even more so with the omicron variant and its subvariants  it became clear that neither vaccination nor previous infection was very protective against infection for very long, although it turned out that protection against severe disease held up well.", "By that time, though, accumulating evidence pointed to the benefit of previously infected people getting vaccinated, and a first booster dose looked to be helpful in protecting against omicron, as we wrote in January 2022.", "Data continue to suggest that an additional shot or two can help boost and broaden the immune response, offering better protection against future variants, although experts say not everyone may need them.", "Today, the CDC says, Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is a safer and more dependable way to build immunity to COVID-19 than getting sick with COVID-19.", "The agency now says people may consider waiting three months after a positive test or the beginning of symptoms to get their next vaccine dose.", "(Some experts say for individuals who are young and healthy, its better to wait a bit longer than that after infection for a booster.)", "The fact that the guidance evolved over the past three years is clearly a source of frustration for the public, but it reflects the changing nature of the threat and incorporated the best available information at the time, Balazs said.", "With the benefit of hindsight it is easy to criticize public health decisions, but people should consider that the facts on the ground kept changing as the pandemic evolved, so the science changed with it.", "Editors note: SciChecks articles providing accurate health information and correcting

might happen, but this experiment would be very expensive (and potentially risky), he said.", "Primates wouldnt capture the broader aspects of human transmission very effectively anyway, so theres no real purpose to doing that experiment.", "Dr. Stanley Perlman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Iowa and member of the FDAs vaccine advisory committee, agreed.", "Youd hardly have to do it in an experimental animal, youd just find it in people, he said of vaccine resistance.", "It wouldnt be a terribly useful thing for a drug company to do.", "Nobody passages virus in monkeys repeatedly.", "I am not aware of how useful this will be especially without drug pressure (treatment), Dr. Raymond F. Schinazi, a biochemist at Emory University School of Medicine who designs and develops new antivirals, told us in an email.", "He questioned whether Walker had any experience in virology or real insight into what Pfizer is doing.", "Starr said it seemed plausible that Walker might have been describing discussions that actually occurred, [b]ut could either be between a bunch of other executives with little virological training like himself as just a brainstorm anything in the world type of discussion, far removed from anything practical that would be done.", "It really reads to me like somebody who was in a conversation that they were only technically astute enough to understand about 25% of, which is the exact danger zone for maximal impact of ignorance!", "he added.", "Thomas Gallagher, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Loyola University Chicago who studies coronaviruses, similarly said he didnt find Walker to be a credible spokesperson for Pfizers virology research.", "We attempted to contact Walker, but were unsuccessful.", "Pfizer did not respond to our inquiries asking about him.", "But as we wrote in a story about another undercover Project Veritas video featuring Walker, a man with his name appears to have graduated from UT Southwestern Medical School in 2018.", "He went on to intern at Tufts Medical Center for one year in general surgery and then was employed by Boston Consulting Group from January 2020 until June 2021.", "This suggests Walker has limited if any virology experience.", "In yet another Project Veritas video, in which the group revealed itself to Walker, he said as much.", "Im not even a scientist by background  I came from a consulting firm that does business, Walker said.", "This is absurd.", "The video, which was released on Jan. 26  but promoted far less than either undercover one  shows Walker getting upset, calling the police and at one point taking and then smashing on the floor an iPad Project Veritas was using to show him the secretly recorded video.", "I was trying to impress a date.", "By lying, he said during the confrontation.", "Why are you doing this to someone whos just working at a company to literally help the public?", "The second main claim related to the Project Veritas video stems from the statement Pfizer released in response to the video, although the company did not name the group.", "Pfizer denied having done any gain of function or directed evolution research for its COVID-19 vaccines.", "But some sentences describing work for its antiviral, Paxlovid, were interpreted as an admission that the company had done gain-of-function research, with some people baselessly suggesting that this was somehow evidence that Pfizer was indeed mutating viruses to intentionally unleash them on the public to sell more vaccines.", "Experts told us the described experiments are standard.", "Some of these might be considered gain-of-function, but that depends on someones definition of the term.", "And even if they are, that doesnt mean that Pfizer shouldnt have been doing them.", "As Pfizer noted, its experiments were required by the FDA and other regulators.", "The company pointed us to the FDAs emergency use authorization letter for Paxlovid and two other industry guidance documents, which describe the types of experiments antiviral drugmakers are expected to do.", "Perlman said he agreed with the companys interpretation.", "Antiviral drugs have to be evaluated for their potential to generate antiviral drug-resistant mutants.", "The standard methods are to propagate viruses in the presence of the antiviral drug and then identify potential resistant mutants by sequencing, Gallagher said.", "If there are several mutations that arise in response to the selective pressures of the antiviral drug, then one must know which of the mutations are conferring the drug resistance, and which are not.", "To find out, viruses are often engineered to contain only one (or a subset) of the mutations, with the engineered viruses then tested for resistance to the antiviral drug, he continued, adding that such tests are standard and appropriate tests in antiviral drug development.", "The gain-of-function debate is partly a semantic one.", "As weve written, gain-of-function is a broad term that could describe many entirely innocuous virology experiments in which a virus gains a new function.", "But the type that is controversial is the small subset of potentially risky experiments that give pathogens new functions that could be harmful if released from a lab.", "Typically, this has meant experiments in which there is a reasonable expectation to make a pathogen either more transmissible or virulent to humans.", "Under that traditional definition, Gallagher said that the experiments Pfizer describes would not be classified as gain-of-function.", "There is nothing in the Pfizer statement that says anything about any such gain of transmissibility or gain of virulence function experiments, he said.", "Perlman also said that gaining antiviral resistance is not necessarily the same as a gain-of-function.", "If I take a bacteria that is sensitive to penicillin and now I make it resistant to penicillin by doing some sort of selection, but at the same time the bacteria can no longer grow in people, is that a gain of function?", "he asked, in an analogy with bacteria.", "I would consider that a loss of function.", "Schinazi, however, said that Pfizers experiments with Paxlovid did sound like gain-of-function research.", "And Starr said that the larger concern is that regardless of what it is called, some experiments have risks worth weighing against their benefits.", "And in theory, a virus resistant to certain drugs could be harmful if it accidentally escaped.", "But that doesnt mean that Pfizer has done anything improper.", "As we said, the experiments are standard for the industry to do.", "Many labs, Schinazi said, as well as industry conducts such in vitro studies (cell based) to learn more about the mutants and to determine if their new drug or analogs are going to be effective.", "If Pfizer did not use National Institutes of Health funding, then it would not be subject to federal review of its experiments under current regulations, he said, but the experiments would still be performed in a biosafety level 3, or BSL-3, lab after internal approval.", "BSL-3 labs require more training and protective gear and are equipped with specialized ventilation systems that prevent workers from being exposed to pathogens they might breathe in.", "A federal advisory committee released draft guidelines on Jan. 20 that propose expanding the definition of gain-of-function research and removing some exemptions, but the changes have not yet been finalized or implemented.", "To me, its all kind of funny, Perlman said of the concern about Pfizers experiments.", "All of the mutations have arisen already if theyre going to arise.", "People get really worried, but the fact is that theres so much drug use and so much virus around that its all going to occur naturally anyway, he added, referring to

Autism & ADHD from Tylenol during pregnancy stating that parents of children with autism or ADHD whose mother took Tylenol while pregnant may be eligible for legal compensation.", "The page continues

acetaminophen taken during pregnancy.", "Some studies have indeed shown a relationship between acetaminophen taken during pregnancy and autism or ADHD in children, but they do not demonstrate that the acetaminophen use caused the elevated rates of autism and ADHD, researchers say.", "For example, a pregnant person who takes acetaminophen may have a child with ADHD or autism because of other factors, such as genetics.", "Experts agree that acetaminophen has a role in pregnancy but that it should be used only when necessary and in consultation with a doctor.", "Avoiding use of acetaminophen for fever or pain during pregnancy may have negative consequences.", "For instance, an uncontrolled fever in early pregnancy can harm brain development.", "A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson told us via email that the available evidence is too limited to make any recommendations based on these studies at this time.", "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a 2021 statement that studies show no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during any trimester and fetal developmental issues.", "An ACOG representative told us that the statement is the most up-to-date communication on the topic.", "And a 2017 Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine statement, which a representative also confirmed to be the most up-to-date document, found the evidence on a causal link between acetaminophen and neurobehavioral disorders to be inconclusive.", "Acetaminophen, called paracetamol outside the U.S., is used widely during pregnancy to treat pain and fever.", "It is an ingredient in many over-the-counter and prescription medications, including Tylenol, DayQuil, NyQuil, Excedrin, Sudafed, Mucinex, Midol, oxycodone, Vicodin and others.", "As we said, some studies have found that women who reported using acetaminophen during pregnancy were more likely than those who didnt to have children who later developed autism or ADHD.", "A 2018 paper published in the American Journal of Epidemiology that aimed to comprehensively analyze data from multiple studies, for example, found a 34% and 19% higher risk of ADHD and autism, respectively, in children whose mothers took acetaminophen in pregnancy compared with those whose mothers did not.", "But this doesnt necessarily mean acetaminophen is to blame for the conditions.", "These studies were observational, meaning that researchers simply noted levels of acetaminophen exposure, generally based on reports from the parents in the studies.", "Randomized controlled trials  in which one group receives a medication or treatment and another group receives a placebo or standard care  are the gold standard for determining whether a causal relationship exists.", "It is possible that people who take more acetaminophen are more likely to have characteristics that predispose them to have a child with autism or ADHD  including the illnesses or other health conditions that might have prompted a pregnant person to take acetaminophen in the first place.", "The authors of the 2018 study recognized this issue, writing that the results should be interpreted with caution given that the available evidence consists of observational studies and is susceptible to several potential sources of bias.", "Sura Alwan, a birth defects epidemiologist and co-director of the Teratogen Information System at the University of Washington, told us in an email that genetic factors might also help explain the results, adding that not all studies have found an association between prenatal acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental outcomes like autism and ADHD.", "In any case, she said, the studies do not necessarily imply a causal link, which means that there isnt enough evidence to say that taking acetaminophen causes those behavioral or cognitive concerns.", "Some researchers do think the associations are worrisome enough to caution women taking acetaminophen during pregnancy.", "In 2021, an international group of scientists, clinicians, and public health professionals published what they called a consensus statement in Nature Reviews Endocrinology, which made news for calling for precautionary action based on data indicating acetaminophen might alter fetal development, with an increasing impact with increasing duration of exposure.", "We recognize that limited medical alternatives exist to treat pain and fever; however, we believe the combined weight of animal and human scientific evidence is strong enough for pregnant women to be cautioned by health professionals against its indiscriminate use, both as a single ingredient and in combination with other medications, the researchers wrote.", "The statement proved controversial, however, with other groups of scientists pushing back to add context and explain why acetaminophen might not have caused the links seen in the studies.", "In my opinion, the level of evidence out there is poor, and I do not believe that there is any causal or any other association between at least short-term use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and ensuing increased risk of childhood ADHD or ASD [autism], Dr.", "Per Damkier, a professor and clinical pharmacologist at Odense University Hospital and University of Southern Denmark, told us in an interview.", "Damkier was one of the scientists who pushed back at the consensus statement.", "Multiple factors contribute to autism and ADHD.", "These conditions are variable in clinical presentation, very difficult to assess and associate with a single causal factor, Alwan said.", "Damkier emphasized that many studies do not adequately take into account whether the parents had ADHD or autism, which run in families.", "He pointed to one study that suggested accounting for ADHD in parents likely weakens the relationship between this disorder and acetaminophen.", "Many studies also rely on questionnaires filled out by parents, Damkier said.", "These may identify children at increased risk of ADHD or autism but do not replace an official diagnosis.", "Finally, Damkier said that even if you accepted the analyses in the studies showing increased risk as valid, which you should not, the risk levels  typically 20% to 30% increased risk during childhood  represent a weak association, especially since there is typically a fair to moderate degree of uncertainty surrounding the numbers.", "A 2019 JAMA Psychiatry study, which is cited in legal advertisements, did not rely on self-reported data, instead looking at concentrations of broken down acetaminophen components in blood collected at Boston Medical Center from umbilical cords at birth and stored for future study.", "The children with acetaminophen exposure in the top third  meaning the highest concentrations of the drug components in cord blood  had 2.86 times higher odds of an ADHD diagnosis and 3.62 times higher odds of an autism diagnosis compared with children with exposure in the bottom third.", "Our findings support previous studies regarding the association between prenatal and perinatal acetaminophen exposure and childhood neurodevelopmental risk and warrant additional investigations, the authors wrote.", "The authors themselves noted some limitations of the paper at the time of publication.", "The cord blood measurements did not give a sense of acetaminophen exposure throughout pregnancy, instead showing recent use by people who had just given birth.", "Further, caution is needed to apply our findings to other populations with different characteristics, they wrote.", "Finally, one author pointed out in a press release that the study does not show that Tylenol causes ADHD or autism.", "Damkier and others said that some observations and the characteristics of the children in the study appeared unusual, making it hard to draw general conclusions.", "Every cord blood sample showed acetaminophen exposure, he noted, and there were extremely high rates of ADHD and autism among the children.", "The study also lacked information on the mothers use of drugs or history of psychiatric disease.", "Expert groups said that acetaminophen can have benefits for pregnant people experiencing pain or fever, and there may not be good alternatives.", "The ACOG statement reads: ACOG and obstetrician-gynecologists across the country have always identified acetaminophen as one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant individuals during pregnancy.", "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and aspirin, can have risks during pregnancy.", "Taking these drugs during later portions of pregnancy can lead to problems including insufficient amniotic fluid volume and premature closing of a major blood vessel in the fetus.", "Opioids can also harm the fetus and lead to withdrawal at birth, as well as pose risks for the mother.", "Avoiding acetaminophen could have consequences for both mother and child.", "Fever early in pregnancy can lead to defects in the neural tube affecting the formation of the brain or spinal cord, Alwan said, noting that it is critically important to treat fever in pregnancy.", "The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine statement calls acetaminophen a reasonable and appropriate medication choice for the treatment of pain and/or fever during pregnancy.", "The authors of the 2021 Nature Reviews Endocrinology statement suggested doing more research into acetaminophen during pregnancy and cautioned women to forego APAP [acetaminophen] unless its use is medically indicated; consult with a physician or pharmacist if they are uncertain whether use is indicated and before using on a long-term basis; and minimize exposure by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time.", "This advice is in line with longstanding recommendations for pregnant people.", "ACOGs clinical guidance remains the same and physicians should not change clinical practice until definitive prospective research is done.", "Most importantly, patients should not be frightened away from the many benefits of acetaminophen.", "However, as always, any medication taken during pregnancy should be used only as needed, in moderation, and after the pregnant patient has consulted with their doctor, the ACOG statement said.", "It is important for pregnant women and all women of reproductive age who may become pregnant to always consult their health care provider to find the best treatment option for pain or fever in pregnancy, which may be taking the recommended dose of acetaminophen and making sure to stay well hydrated and getting lots of rest, Alwan said.", "People with questions about medications during pregnancy or breastfeeding can contact organizations like MotherToBaby, she added.", "An FDA spokesperson told us in an email: The FDA is aware of and understands the concerns arising from reports questioning the safety of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines when used during pregnancy.", "As a result, we evaluated research studies on acetaminophen published in the medical literature and determined that they are too limited to make any recommendations based on these studies at this time.", "Because of this uncertainty, the use of pain medicines during pregnancy should be carefully considered.", "We urge pregnant persons to always discuss all medicines with their health care professionals before using them.", "Acetaminophen labels contain the following information regarding pregnancy: If pregnant or breast feeding, ask a health professional before use.", "The FDA continues to review the published literature and to monitor the potential impacts of acetaminophen.", "The spokesperson

days for the small group of people who received two vaccine doses in the same menstrual cycle.", "The cycle length changes went away after one to two cycles.", "A follow-up study, which Edelman and Male co-authored and published in September, used the same method for a global population of nearly 20,000 people, and found a less-than-one-day increase in cycle length that returned to normal within one cycle.", "Another study, published in November, took a similar approach with period data inputted from almost 10,000 iPhone users, and identified a half-day or less increase in menstrual cycles

Project Veritas video, Walker, whose remarks were edited, speculated about the mechanism for the menstrual cycle changes, saying it has to be affecting something hormonal.", "He added that we need to figure out how it is impacting these hormones because the signaling starts in the brain and the vaccine doesnt cross the blood-brain barrier.", "A hormone-based explanation is certainly one of the leading hypotheses for why vaccination can cause some small, temporary changes to menstrual cycles.", "As Male laid out in a review published in Science in November, there are two plausible, non-mutually exclusive mechanisms: one involving the innate immune systems interim ability to interfere with hormones, and another involving immune cells such as macrophages and natural killer cells, which help control the shedding and regrowth of the uterine lining.", "Regardless, nothing untoward is going on in the brain, Male told us.", "We dont yet know exactly how COVID vaccination is causing these small changes to menstrual timing and flow, but I think the most likely possibility is that aspects of the immune response can temporarily alter the way the hypothalamus, pituitary and ovaries communicate with each other (the HPO axis), she said in an email.", "To be clear, this doesnt mean that the vaccine gets into or directly affects any of these organs (there is no evidence of this) but rather [that] they are responding to the general immune activation in your body.", "We already know that this can happen in fever, which affects about 15% of people who are vaccinated, Male continued.", "As part of initiating the protective immune response, immune molecules called cytokines are produced, and some of these reset the thermostat of the hypothalamus to increase your body temperature.", "Its possible that a similar mechanism is at work to alter the timing of periods and one piece of evidence in support of this is that people whose cycles are driven by taking hormonal contraception seem to be less likely to notice a change than people whose cycles are being driven by their HPO axis.", "In her review, Male noted that menstrual changes have been reported before for other vaccines, and there is some evidence to indicate that such changes might occur after infection with the coronavirus.", "The studies on COVID-19, however, she said, have not been as rigorously done as for vaccination, in part because infection is much harder to study.", "Edelman and Male agree more research is needed in the long-understudied area of menstrual health, not just for the COVID-19 vaccines, but also for other vaccines and diseases.", "[W]e need to do a better job of listening and validating the patient experience and integrate issues which are important to the public,

suggest that atmospheric rivers become stronger (more water vapor transport) in a warmer climate and are generally associated with higher precipitation amounts, OBrien added.", "Atmospheric rivers are measured in whats called integrated water vapor transport, Kalansky, from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, explained.", "That includes both how much water is there and the wind that transports the vapor, she said.", "What climate models are showing, she said, is that in a future warmer world, atmospheric rivers will contribute more than other storms to Californias rainfall total annually, and that extreme atmospheric river events will become more extreme  and thats mostly explained by the increase in water vapor.", "Swain told us the thermodynamic contribution is likely responsible for 80% of the projected change in atmospheric river intensity and the projected extreme precipitation increases.", "The remainder is more uncertain, he said, but wind and pressure patterns could be important factors.", "But there are still many basic things scientists dont know about atmospheric rivers and the ways they will respond to a warming climate.", "In climate models, there is a robust increase in global mean precipitation; however, how the response of ARs contributes towards this change is still uncertain and depends on many more factors than increased moisture alone, reads a

same degree by climate change.", "The study simulated a specific atmospheric river storm that hit Northern California in two waves in 2017 under past, present and future climate scenarios.", "While both waves of the storm dropped more precipitation because of warming, the second wave dumped more.", "Precipitation amounts for the first and second waves were about 11% and 15% higher, respectively, under present-day warming, the study found.", "Those amounts increased to an additional 21% and 59% boost in precipitation, respectively, under late-21st century warming.", "Its not clear whether there will be more or fewer atmospheric rivers in a warmer climate.", "Most studies, OBrien said, do indicate an increase in the frequency of atmospheric rivers, but also some indicate a decrease or no change for western North America.", "Part of the issue, OBrien found in a 2021 paper, is that researchers are not always consistent in how they define an atmospheric river.", "For California specifically, Swain said that while its uncertain, the preponderance of evidence is for fewer atmospheric rivers overall in a warmer future.", "But, he said, there is also strong evidence that the *strongest* atmospheric rivers in California (like those being experienced during this storm sequence) are very likely to be stronger and to produce more precipitation as the climate warms.", "There is a quite a bit of evidence pointing in this direction at this point, he added.", "Not yet, climate experts say.", "I dont think we have evidence to show the degree these events are connected to climate change, Duane Waliser, chief scientist at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told us in an email.", "Waliser, who has studied atmospheric rivers and climate changes effects on them, told us it would require more study to quantify an estimate of the effects of climate change on the storms.", "[U]ntil that happens, a statement along these lines would be complete speculation, he wrote.", "OBrien agreed.", "He said it is impossible to make a formal statement about the effect of climate change on these storms without a detection and attribution study.", "Detection and attribution studies can help determine whether a human influence on climate variables (for example, temperature) can be distinguished from natural variability, according to a federal report on climate science.", "They are important, OBrien said, because events like this can, and did, happen before climate change.", "OBrien said there have been no detection and attribution studies on this storm yet, but he

said, we expect that as the planet warms in response to increasing greenhouse gases, there should be multi-year periods in which the warming appears to accelerate and others in which [it] appears to slow down  and if one picks precisely the right years, one can find periods where there are temporary nominally negative trends.", "That appears to be the case for the eight years that Milloy

Injury Research catalogs injuries for high school and college athletes, and its most recent report covers the 2020-21 school year.", "It shows that 21 athletes died while playing their sport that year.", "COVID-19 vaccines were available to everyone 16 and over in the U.S. by April 2021, so the overlap between the period covered by the report and the period in which vaccines were widely available to young people was relatively small.", "We reached out to the center to find out if the data collected for the 2021-2022 school year has indicated any increase in deaths.", "The centers director, Dr. Kristen Kucera, told us that so far, the numbers are the same and its actually fewer than we captured in 2018-19.", "For context, the center reported 19 deaths in 2019-20, 25 deaths in

talk and communicate all the time, he said, and none of his colleagues has flagged a rise in sudden cardiac arrest.", "Theres been no increase, he said.", "Also, Daniels noted, theres a high vaccination rate among athletes in part because many organizations require vaccination to participate.", "He noted that a rare side effect of the mRNA vaccines is heart inflammation, or myocarditis,

the second dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "Those cases have appeared to resolve faster and have better clinical outcomes when compared with the more common cases of myocarditis caused by viral infection, including from the virus that causes COVID-19.", "Despite that, anti-vaccine campaigners have distorted the rare vaccine side effect as being more common than it is, using that misrepresentation in claims about increases in athlete deaths.", "For those who develop myocarditis, stressing the heart with intense physical activity could create an arrhythmia resulting in a cardiac event, Daniels said.", "And, in fact, Daniels said, we have not seen an increase in events.", "So, he said, if the vaccines were causing an increase in sudden deaths, we would be seeing it here and were not.", "As we said, an anonymous website called Good Sciencing is one of the primary sources used to make the claim about a surge in sudden deaths among athletes.", "The site retains the same problems we identified when we first wrote about it soon after it showed up online in late 2021.", "Regardless, its use by anti-vaccine activists has continued to spread.", "Now its the source of the information in the letter to the editor cited by both Wheeler and Gold.", "This recent version of the claim compares the number of athletes listed on the website with numbers compiled in an unrelated 2006 paper, which sought to develop a system to screen athletes for heart problems in order to reduce the number of sudden cardiac deaths in sports.", "In the Gold and Wheeler tweets, a highlighted portion of McCulloughs letter to the editor says that 1,101 athletes have died since January 2021, citing the Good Sciencing list.", "The letter then cites the 2006 study to say that the same number had died in the 38-year period covered by the paper.", "Gold and Wheeler emphasized the part equating that to about 29 deaths per year, implying there had been 1,101 athlete deaths in the previous year compared with an average of 29 athlete deaths per year before the COVID-19 vaccines were introduced.", "But, as we said, the Good Sciencing list and the 2006 paper use different criteria for age, athletic affiliation, cause of death and the sources used to record the deaths.", "The Good Sciencing website counts deaths from any cause for all ages among those who were listed in media reports to have some association with sports, including professional athletes, hikers, retirees and coaches.", "The 2006 paper counted sudden cardiac deaths among athletes younger than 35 years old that had appeared in English-language academic literature in a 38-year period starting in 1966.", "So, comparing those numbers doesnt mean much, since theyre measuring different things.", "There is also an important difference in the sources used to record the number of deaths.", "Because the 2006 paper drew only from deaths reported in academic literature, the total number is limited.", "The paper itself notes that its most important limitation is that sudden cardiac death in young athletes as reported in the published and studied papers is certainly underestimated.", "It goes on to say that the lack of national or international registers and the uncertainty of the number of athletes involved forms the basis of this problem.", "We found the same problem in reporting on this issue, too.", "The only functioning repository collecting information on athlete deaths in all sports that we could find in the U.S. was the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research.", "The Minneapolis Heart Institute had once run the U.S. National Registry of Sudden Death in Athletes, but its no longer maintaining the registry, the institutes Dr. Kevin Harris told us in a phone interview.", "While it was still functioning, that registry was used in a 2009 paper that assessed the incidence of sudden death in U.S. athletes who were 39 and younger.", "It found that the most common cause of death was due to underlying (and predominantly unsuspected) cardiovascular disease, which accounted for more than half of cases, but other causes included blunt trauma and heat stroke.", "Most of those cardiovascular deaths  93%  were among athletes who were 25 or younger and the total number of those deaths each year was under 100.", "We spent a lot of time tabulating death rates in young athletes, Dr. Barry Maron, the lead author of the paper, told us in a phone interview.", "If there were a significant increase, wed know about it, Maron said.", "Kids would be dropping left and right.", "There hasnt been that kind of increase.", "As we said, the Good Sciencing list is based on a broad definition of what constitutes the sudden death of an athlete and includes people

COVID-19 Vaccine meets the FDAs rigorous standards for safety and effectiveness and the agency strongly believes the potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the potential risks of COVID-19, she said.", "Heres what the paper actually said: FDA researchers used a system drawing on data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for more than 30 million elderly people

ailments initially met the threshold for a statistical signal after COVID-19 vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech shot.", "None met the threshold following vaccination with the shots from either Moderna or Johnson & Johnson.", "Then, after further evaluation, three of the initially flagged ailments  immune thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation and acute myocardial infarction  no longer met the statistical threshold, leaving only pulmonary embolism as a potential safety signal.", "Our new findings of statistical signals for four important outcomes for the [Pfizer] vaccine should be interpreted cautiously because the early warning system does not prove that vaccines cause the safety outcomes, the researchers wrote.", "FDA strongly believes the potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the potential risks of COVID-19 infection.", "Deeper epidemiological studies that account for factors such as age and nursing home residency are underway to further evaluate the potential safety signals, according to the paper.", "As weve explained before, the mRNA vaccines  which include the shots from Pfizer and Moderna  have not been associated with any kind of clotting problem.", "In March, Dr. John Su, a medical officer for the CDCs Vaccine Safety Team, told us, To date, CDC has detected no unusual or unexpected patterns of blood clots, such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following immunization.", "The J&J vaccine, however, can cause a particular kind of clotting that also involves low levels of blood platelets.", "The condition is very rare, and the CDC has recommended the two mRNA vaccines over J&Js, which has accounted for only a small minority of the vaccine doses administered in the U.S.",

in November that looked at all the available research on the question of mRNA vaccines and clots, which included six robust studies including analysis of over 27 million doses of mRNA vaccines, found that the consistent result is that mRNA vaccines are not statistically associated with [venous thromboembolism], or clots that form in veins.", "And, actually, vaccination against COVID-19 could help to prevent blood clots, since it can prevent infection with the virus that can cause clotting, as weve explained before.", "A person is much more likely to get a blood clot after being infected with COVID-19 than they are to get a clot after being vaccinated, Allison Burnett, president of the Anticoagulation Forum  an organization that works with health care providers to improve patient care  told us in September.", "So the message is  get vaccinated to avoid blood clots, since getting infected can increase the risk of clots, she said.", "The FDA isnt taking any regulatory actions based on the findings of the recent paper because the signals are still under investigation and require more robust study, the researchers wrote.", "The statistical signals of four serious outcomes are not necessarily causal and may be due to factors potentially unrelated to vaccination, they wrote.", "For example, the elderly Medicare population that received the [Pfizer/BioNTech] vaccine differed from other elderly COVID-19 vaccinated populations, including a preponderance of nursing home residents and populations with a higher comorbidity burden, they wrote.", "When we asked Pfizer for comment on the claims circulating about the FDAs paper, a spokesperson told us that the company takes seriously any adverse events reported after vaccination with its shots.", "It is important to understand,

analyses to support their claim that the COVID-19 vaccines are more dangerous than medical authorities have let on.", "The first is a paper, co-authored by Fraiman, which reanalyzed data from the Pfizer and Moderna trials and claimed to find an alarming increase in serious adverse events of special interest in vaccine recipients compared with the placebo groups.", "Adverse events are health issues that occur following vaccination, but are not necessarily caused by vaccination.", "The study was highly criticized when it was released as an unpublished preprint in June and after it was published in the journal Vaccine in August.", "To our surprise, in the Pfizer trial  the first vaccine to go through  there was a 37% increase in the number of serious adverse events.", "That was never reported, not by the FDA, not by Pfizer, Fraiman said of his study during the roundtable.", "It turns out, with both Pfizer and Moderna, we had a 1 in 800 risk of serious adverse events, he added, saying that by comparison, most people, the majority of people, dont have a 1 in 800 chance of even being hospitalized from COVID-19.", "But as other factcheckers have reported, scientists have noted numerous problems with the paper.", "First, the authors focused their analysis on what are called serious adverse events of special interest, or serious AESIs, which include events that in theory might be related to vaccination.", "But the trial reported all serious adverse events, so the authors had to choose the events they thought corresponded to the ones of special interest.", "Some of the decisions, critics say, appear arbitrary or inconsistent, and therefore could have been cherry-picked.", "Second, the analysis was based on the total number of adverse events, and not on the number of people who experienced the events, which is the approach the FDA uses.", "The authors didnt have access to patient-level data from the trials, so they couldnt do the analysis the way the FDA did, and they attempted to correct for this with a simple adjustment.", "Regardless, this is a dubious methodology that could easily inflate the figures, since someone who has two or three symptoms would be counted two or three times.", "That is particularly relevant because the authors said they used a simple harm-benefit framework to place our results in context, and concluded the risk of serious adverse events of special interest is higher than the vaccines reductions in COVID-19 hospitalization.", "Again, this is flawed because adverse events were counted separately, even if a single person experienced several, whereas people who were hospitalized for COVID-19 and may have experienced multiple symptoms were only counted once.", "And as Susan Oliver, an Australian scientist who corrects misinformation on YouTube, has explained, its also an apples to oranges comparison because many of the adverse events would not be as severe as a COVID-19 hospitalization  and because while the entire vaccinated group received the vaccine, very few people were exposed to the coronavirus.", "This greatly underestimates the benefit of the vaccines.", "Multiple outside observers have said the paper looks to be a case of data dredging or data fishing, when researchers arrive at incorrect results after analyzing data in a bunch of different ways.", "If someone digs through data long enough, they will find results that are statistically significant, even when that finding may not be real.", "Thats why scientists usually specify in advance how they plan to analyze the data.", "Its worth noting that even if taken at face value, the papers alleged findings are not as explosive as Fraiman says.", "For example, when analyzed individually, neither the Pfizer nor the Moderna trial shows a statistical difference in the number of serious adverse events of special interest among the vaccine and placebo groups.", "Its only when the trials are combined that the authors claim to find a 43% increase in such events, or an extra 12.5 events per 10,000 people, among vaccine recipients.", "Fraiman and his co-authors have argued that the criticisms of their paper are invalid, but Jeffrey Morris, director of the division of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania, told us in an email that he doesnt find their response sufficient or convincing.", "I still think their selection of which events to include and how [they] reclassified/binned the events is dubious, he said, but what is really ridiculous is their portrayal of it as a valid risk benefit.", "Trial data cant get at that, he explained, because the benefit of vaccination lasts a long time, and much of the benefit would occur outside of the trial, whereas most of the risks of the vaccine occur soon after vaccination and would be captured in the trial.", "Their argument that trial data is sufficient to capture the scope of benefit is laughably ridiculous, and not addressed in the response by the authors  and leads to an exceptionally skewed risk-benefit, Morris said.", "The second analysis the roundtable put forward as evidence of the vaccines danger is an unpublished report the state of Florida released in October that claimed to find an 84% increase in the relative incidence of cardiac-related death among males 18-39 years old within 28 days following mRNA vaccination.", "But as experts told us at the time, the analysis, which was used to justify Floridas decision to no longer recommend younger males receive mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, had major flaws.", "Update, Jan. 5: A committee at the University of Florida College of Medicine, where Ladapo is on the faculty, also said in a report released in early January 2023 that the analysis was seriously flawed and should not have been used as the basis to recommend against vaccination.", "Update, April 19: The Tampa Bay Times reported in April that earlier versions of the report included additional data and were at odds with the states decision to recommend against vaccination in young men.", "None of the five drafts concluded there was evidence to suggest that the risk of vaccination outweighed the benefits.", "Update, May 2: Based on a draft obtained through a public information request, Politico reported on April 24 that Ladapo was responsible for some edits to the analysis that altered the conclusions and presented vaccination as risky for young men.", "Rather than compare deaths among vaccinated or unvaccinated people, the analysis only included people who died after vaccination and evaluated the potential risk of vaccination by looking at differences in the number of deaths during the first month after vaccination versus in a remaining 25-week period.", "This unusual method, known as a self-controlled case series, can be a powerful tool, but also can be tricky to do, especially when dealing with a terminal event such as death.", "And in this case, experts in the method said the study didnt account for the fact that when people receive multiple vaccine doses, they spend more time being within a month of vaccination than further out from vaccination.", "This can skew the result.", "Notably, an analysis from the U.K.s Office for National Statistics that used the same method, but avoided the problem with the Florida analysis, did not identify any increased risk of death after vaccination.", "During the roundtable, Ladapo acknowledged that the states analysis was preliminary and not perfect, but quickly pivoted to saying that no study was perfect, and calling the findings remarkable.", "While myocarditis and pericarditis are real risks of the vaccines, particularly for younger males and after the second dose, studies have found that the conditions are still rare following vaccination  and rarely life-threatening.", "There is no reliable evidence that the vaccines have increased the risk of death for any population.", "Numerous teams of experts have concluded that to date, the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks, even for younger males.", "There is a large literature on the safety of mRNA vaccines, and recommendations should be based on a comprehensive overview of the available evidence, not any one single study (even less so if it is unpublished), Paddy Farrington, an expert in self-controlled case series and a professor emeritus of statistics at the Open University in the U.K., told us in an email in October.", "Near the end of the roundtable, Ladapo announced a plan to conduct a surveillance study of myocarditis in people who die within a few weeks of COVID-19 vaccination using autopsy results.", "The study will be done in collaboration with the University of Florida, and the states health department will use disease surveillance and vital statistics to assess such deaths, according to the roundtables press release.", "Ladapos inspiration comes from a recently published study by scientists affiliated with Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany.", "The researchers examined autopsy data from 35 people who died unexpectedly within 20 days of COVID-19 vaccination and concluded that for five of them, vaccine-induced myocarditis represented the likely or possible cause of death.", "But as we and others have written, experts say there isnt enough evidence to prove that their deaths were caused by the vaccine.", "(For more, see our story Autopsy Study Doesnt Show COVID-19 Vaccines Are Unsafe.)", "The temporal association of lymphocytic myocarditis following vaccination suggests but does not

compared the DMED database with the source data contained in the Defense Medical Surveillance System, it discovered that the total number of medical diagnoses from 2016-2020 that were accessible in DMED represented only a small fraction of actual medical diagnoses for those years.", "So comparing data from 2021, which was up-to-date, with data from 2016-2020 resulted in the appearance of significant increased occurrence of all medical diagnoses in 2021 because of the underreported data for 2016-2020, the representative added.", "The article also notes that the agency temporarily took DMED offline to identify and correct the root-cause of the data corruption.", "The database is now back online.", "But Died Suddenly falsely suggests the database went offline to avoid further investigation and incorrectly implies its still inaccessible.", "In randomized controlled trials and surveillance studies, the COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be remarkably safe, often causing temporary and expected side effects such as a sore arm, but only very rarely causing serious harm.", "The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, as we mentioned, very rarely may cause TTS, and may also increase the risk of Guillain-Barr Syndrome.", "The mRNA vaccines are both associated with an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, or inflammation of the heart or its surrounding tissue.", "While real, the risk of these conditions is very low, and they are primarily observed in younger males.", "There is no evidence that the vaccines cause the wide range of health problems the video claims.", "The last quarter of Died Suddenly is devoted to unsupported claims about the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on pregnant people.", "Studies have repeatedly shown that the vaccines are not associated with an increased risk of miscarriage or stillbirth, contrary to what is presented in the video.", "The video shows a phone call with Michelle Gershon, described onscreen as a whistle blower RN from the post partum ward of a major hospital in Fresno, CA, who suggests that an increase in stillbirths at her hospital are related to COVID-19 vaccination.", "As evidence, she shares an internal hospital email that gives a record high number of demise patients for one month.", "But as weve written, there hasnt been an increase in stillbirths in Fresno or California with the advent of COVID-19 vaccination.", "And the email, which makes no reference to COVID-19 vaccination, never states that its figure is only for stillbirths.", "Fetal death, or fetal demise, refers to death at any time in pregnancy.", "Deaths before 20 weeks of gestation are miscarriages, while deaths after 20 weeks (or sometimes 28 weeks) are considered stillbirths.", "For that reason, among others, no rate of stillbirths can be calculated from the email figure.", "Yet that is precisely what Died Suddenly proceeds to do, showing a presentation given by Dr. James Thorp, a Florida gynecologist who has trafficked in COVID-19 misinformation, in which he erroneously attempts to graph the purported increase in stillbirths calculated using the number.", "Thorp then repeats this same flawed exercise using two bogus figures for stillbirths (more than 80 stillbirths in Waterloo, Canada, and 13 dead fetuses in one 24-hour period) that we and others have previously debunked.", "Numerous studies have not found any link to COVID-19 vaccination and a higher risk of stillbirth.", "In fact, some have found a lower risk, likely because the shots protect against COVID-19, and the disease is known to increase the risk of stillbirth.", "Thorp then baselessly claims there is a substantial increase in miscarriages, in birth defects as a result of vaccination, with the video showing a series of images of infants with deformities.", "The implication is that the photos are of babies born to mothers who had been vaccinated, but thats incorrect.", "Two of the images are from well before the vaccines were available.", "The first, as Dr. Frank Han, a cardiologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, noted on Twitter, comes from a scientific paper published in 2011.", "The second, which shows a child born without a nose, is an AP photo from 2015 that ran in a Today Show story about the boy.", "A third image has been taken from a YouTube video posted by a plastic surgery clinic in India, for a baby born prior to April 2021.", "There is no indication the childs cleft palate is due to COVID-19 vaccination.", "India did not even authorize COVID-19 shots for pregnant people until July 2021, and the country at the time wasnt using any of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S.", "The video then pivots to another claim about pregnancy loss, with Long, the Army flight surgeon, falsely saying that a Pfizer document outlined that 83% of all pregnant women who got vaccinated ended up with a dead baby.", "Purveyors of misinformation have previously misinterpreted the document to incorrectly claim, as weve written, that it showed 44% of vaccinated women miscarried.", "Again, studies have found that COVID-19 vaccination does not increase the risk of miscarriage and can reduce the risk of stillbirth by protecting against COVID-19.", "Earlier in the video, Long also incorrectly cited the same Pfizer document as evidence that the vaccine is harming people  and part of a conspiracy to intentionally kill people.", "I think if you look at the  post-marketing analysis report and the 1,291 adverse events, I dont think those came as diagnostic tests.", "I think they came as confirmatory tests, she said.", "You ordered a product, you wanted the product to kill people, pay stockholders, you got exactly what you ordered.", "Except the Pfizer document, which covers the first three months of the vaccines rollout, shows nothing of the sort, as weve written.", "It describes the adverse events reported following vaccination  which are not necessarily caused by vaccination  and confirms a favorable benefit: risk balance of the vaccine.", "In other words, the document is evidence of the vaccines continued safety.", "As for the 1,291 adverse events, thats a misinterpretation of the documents appendix, which lists in alphabetical order all of the adverse events of special interest that Pfizer was monitoring for.", "It is not a list of health problems that have been observed after or shown to be due to vaccination.", "The documentary also baselessly blames COVID-19 vaccination for a birth rate decline in several countries.", "In a clip of what is labeled on screen as a 2022 hearing before the Hungarian Parliament, a woman speaking Hungarian, dubbed into English, says that in January, something happened that has not happened for decades: The birth rate fell by 20% compared to the same period last year.", "She adds that according to the Centre for Economic and Regional Studies the drastic decline came just nine months after the COVID mass vaccination began in Hungary.", "There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination has lowered the birth rate or reduced fertility.", "Preliminary data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office show a decline of 11.6% in the number of births for the first quarter of 2022, compared with the same period a year before.", "But the decline narrows to less than 5% for the cumulative totals in the second and third quarters  and those totals are nearly identical to the figures from just a few years ago.", "Experts quoted in Hungarian news reports have said the decline in births in January of this year could be due to several factors, including people postponing having children either because of the pandemic or because of wanting to wait to get pregnant after getting vaccinated.", "They said the drop might also reflect the impact of policies used to increase the population, which may have incentivized families to have children earlier than they otherwise would have, boosting births in 2020 and 2021, but artificially lowering them in later years.", "According to the data, the figures for births in 2022 are very similar to those in 2019.", "Later, the video shows a graph purportedly charting birth rate declines in several countries, but with no dates or sources, so its not even clear what the decline is relative to.", "The worst listed decline, of 70%, is in Australia.", "We could not find any support for this statistic.", "Australias fertility rate has been falling since the 1960s, according to the Australian Institute of Family Studies.", "The birth rate fell from 64 per 1,000 women in 2010 to 56 per 1,000 women in 2020.", "Fertility rates reached a record low in 2020, and officials said COVID-19 disruptions could have played a role.", "But in

still at low risk, such as a 25-year-old with asthma.", "Boulware said he thought there was only a small benefit of Paxlovid even in vaccinated older people, in part because the vaccines work so well.", "But it certainly does have a benefit in people who are elderly, who are immunocompromised, who are not vaccinated, who have not had prior infection, he added.", "As for the claim about not stopping viral transmission, Boulware said that in theory, because the drug reduces the viral load in people, Paxlovid would be expected to reduce  but not eliminate  transmission, although there isnt data on that yet.", "Much of Mercolas post is focused on COVID-19 rebound, or a resurgence in a persons viral load, which can cause someone to test positive after testing negative, sometimes accompanied by a recurrence of symptoms.", "The article details several examples of public figures, including President Joe Biden, Dr. Anthony Fauci and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, who experienced rebound after taking Paxlovid.", "As weve written, many experts believe the rebound phenomenon is more likely after taking Paxlovid, but its still unknown how frequent it is  and rebound does happen in the absence of Paxlovid.", "Pfizer told us in a statement that the company believes rebound is uncommon and not uniquely associated with any specific treatment.", "The company reported in an unpublished study in June that in its main trial, the viral loads of COVID-19 patients rebounded after treatment in 7.0% of Paxlovid recipients and 4.1% of placebo recipients.", "Both arms of the trial included nearly 1,000 people.", "A preliminary, unpublished study released this month suggests the rebound rates could be higher, with or without Paxlovid.", "The study prospectively followed 170 people who tested positive for COVID-19 and were eligible to take Paxlovid.", "It found that 14.2% of people who chose to receive Paxlovid and 9.3% of people who opted not to take the drug tested positive again on an antigen test, with 18.9% of people taking Paxlovid and 7.0% of those who didnt experiencing a recurrence of symptoms.", "While the results point toward rebound being more common after taking the drug, the study was too small and not statistically powered to identify differences between the groups.", "As evidence of rebound being a problem, the post cites a CDC advisory from May that describes COVID-19 rebound after Paxlovid treatment.", "But Mercola neglects to mention that the agency explicitly states in boldface that the drug continues to be recommended.", "For people who are not truly high risk  and are unlikely to benefit much from Paxlovid  Boulware said the heightened risk of rebound is a valid reason not to take the drug.", "But it should not dissuade those for whom the medication is most likely to help.", "COVID-19 rebound could be annoying and prolong how long someone needs to isolate, but does not appear to lead to severe illness.", "We advise patients of the possibility of rebound with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, but for patients at risk for progression to severe disease (such as those with advanced age or multiple comorbidities), the potential benefits of treatment greatly outweigh any potential inconvenience from rebound, the authors of an UpToDate review on the topic wrote.", "By contrast, we do not use nirmatrelvir-ritonavir simply to shorten the duration of viral shedding in people who are not at high risk for progression, as the possibility of rebound negates this effect.", "As for the many high-profile rebound cases, Mercolas examples are factual, but the anecdotes are probably not representative.", "Boulware suspects that one issue at play is the timing of Paxlovid treatment.", "If the medication is given very early after diagnosis, as it often is for high-profile politicians and physicians, he said, rebound might be more likely.", "I think [for] the average person, where it takes them a couple days to get a diagnosis, talk to a doctor, call in a prescription and go to the pharmacy, rebound is less common, he said.", "While misleadingly calling Paxlovid a fraud, Mercola also makes false claims about other drugs.", "He incorrectly says that remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral approved for COVID-19, routinely causes severe organ damage and, often, death, and asserts that ivermectin, an antiparasitic medication, has been very effective against COVID-19 and shown to outperform at least 10 other drugs, including Paxlovid.", "Boulware said both claims were false.", "As weve written, clinical trials have not found remdesivir is hazardous to COVID-19 patients.", "Patients receiving remdesivir need to be monitored, and the drug should not be used in some patients with kidney disease, for example.", "But that does not mean the drug cannot be safely used.", "The study Mercola cites for the claim, a small randomized controlled trial conducted in China in early 2020 and published in the Lancet, concluded that remdesivir was adequately tolerated.", "While more patients in the remdesivir than the placebo group discontinued the drug due to adverse events, a similar percentage of patients in both groups experienced adverse events or died.", "All deaths during the observation period were judged by the site investigators to be unrelated to the intervention, the paper reads.", "Boulware said remdesivir is not being used much for outpatient therapy anyway, since it must be administered intravenously.", "The notion that ivermectin is highly effective against COVID-19 and is better than Paxlovid is also incorrect.", "Large, placebo-blinded randomized controlled trials have repeatedly failed to identify meaningful clinical benefits of ivermectin against COVID-19, as weve written.", "Mercola misleadingly cites a computational study for his claim about ivermectins superiority.", "Using computer modeling to estimate the ability of 10 promising drugs to bind to a critical coronavirus protein, the authors found that ivermectin showed the highest binding affinity, which they say suggests ivermectin could be the most effective drug candidate.", "But the authors also say that further research is crucial to authenticate these statements.", "Indeed, a computer-based protein binding study does not trump the numerous clinical studies that tell us how the two drugs perform in people, which clearly show Paxlovid as the superior therapy.", "Editors note: SciChecks COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson

stillbirth rate is, it wont mean that COVID-19 isnt a risk to pregnant people.", "Male explained that because stillbirth is quite rare, the additional stillbirths due to COVID-19 might not make that big of an impact on the national numbers.", "She told us, for example, that in the U.K., there were only 77 COVID-19 stillbirths up through October 2021  which wasnt a lot relative to the annual

health care or eldercare, relatives of those who are at high risk and pregnant women.", "The aim of the vaccination programme against covid-19 this autumn is to get us well through the winter by protecting people who are at the highest risk of becoming severely ill and by avoiding that the Danish healthcare system, especially the hospitals, are overburdened, the Danish Health Authority

claims.", "But her claims just arent true.", "Other related claims have been pervasive online, such as the meme shared by Donald Trump Jr. suggesting that recently updated guidance from the CDC matches what those who have downplayed the severity of the pandemic and questioned the value of the vaccines had been saying all along.", "But the new guidance doesnt indicate that health care experts were wrong about the vaccines or any other mitigation measures they had recommended.", "The truth is, the effectiveness of vaccines shifted with each of the new variants, Dr. Peter Hotez, Co-Director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Childrens Hospital and Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told us in a phone interview.", "When the vaccines were approved for emergency use in 2020, they were approved based on their demonstrated ability to prevent symptomatic illness, he said.", "And large clinical trials showed that the efficacy was high.", "For example, the updated trial results reported to the Food and Drug Administration for full approval showed the Moderna vaccine was 93.2% effective in preventing symptomatic disease at least two weeks after the second dose in people 18 years of age and older.", "The vaccines were also highly effective when they were first introduced to the public in the real world.", "The initial SARS-CoV-2 that we had, that initial wild type, the vaccine against it did work against infection, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, said in a recent interview on Fox News.", "It worked actually quite well against infection.", "It also worked against severe disease and death.", "A promising early study from Israel showed that the vaccines had been more than 90% effective in preventing both symptomatic illness and asymptomatic infection in the early days after the rollout.", "That was really exciting because it meant that, maybe, we could vaccinate our way out of this pandemic, Hotez said.", "After the first variant, alpha, emerged, the vaccines remained highly effective against infection, severe disease and death, Walensky said.", "In May 2021, the CDC said that those who were fully vaccinated could stop wearing masks.", "Then the virus mutated, and the delta variant became dominant in the summer of 2021.", "Although the vaccines remained effective against severe illness and death from COVID-19, they were somewhat less effective at preventing infection from delta.", "Thats when the CDC reversed its recommendation and said that those who were vaccinated should wear a mask indoors.", "That fall, the Biden administration made booster shots available.", "The virus keeps changing, and subvariants of omicron are now dominant.", "Its become increasingly clear that the vaccines are less effective in preventing infection than they had been with earlier variants.", "This is due to two things, Hotez said  changes to the virus and the natural decline in the potency of vaccination over time, which happens with most vaccines.", "The CDC noted the waning effect of immunity from the vaccines in an August report explaining the most recent changes to its guidance on COVID-19 prevention, which included a recommendation for booster doses.", "Overall booster dose coverage in the United States remains low, which is concerning given the meaningful reductions in risk for severe illness and death that booster doses provide and the importance of booster doses to counter waning of vaccine-induced immunity, according to the paper, which was published in the CDCs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Aug. 11.", "It also noted that the vaccines are highly protective against severe disease and death, and that they offer minimal protection against infection and transmission.", "That last part is what Victory and others highlighted, while neglecting to mention how effective the vaccines are against serious illness.", "Victory claimed that the CDC had acknowledged that the vaccines were essentially ineffective.", "But thats not accurate.", "As we said, the CDC explained that being up to date with vaccination offers minimal protection from infection, but, importantly, significant protection against severe disease.", "Being up to date with vaccination means that youve gotten the primary series of doses and any boosters that are available for your age group, the CDC has explained.", "Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most

the surface of the virus and is what the virus uses to enter cells.", "Unlike the vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, however, which instruct cells in the body to make the spike protein using

tiny synthetic nanoparticles.", "As many as 14 spike proteins will self-assemble around a nanoparticle core, creating spike-studded particles that mimic the structure of the coronavirus.", "A plant-derived adjuvant is also added to the spike nanoparticles to augment the immune response, since the spike proteins alone do not generate a robust immune response.", "Adjuvants are often needed with protein subunit vaccines because unlike vaccines that use weakened or killed germs, subunit vaccines contain only part of the pathogen.", "This makes the vaccines generally safer and with fewer side effects, but without an added component to stimulate the innate immune system, the vaccine isnt able to provide good long-term immunity.", "The Novavax adjuvant is made from saponin extracts from the bark of the soapbark tree, which grows in Chile.", "A different saponin-based adjuvant is used in the shingles vaccine.", "As with all other authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines, there is no way to catch COVID-19 from the Novavax vaccine since it doesnt contain any virus.", "As just discussed, the main difference between the Novavax vaccine and the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is the more standard vaccine design.", "Protein subunit vaccines are common, and include hepatitis B and influenza vaccines, among others.", "Even compared with the J&J vaccine, which uses a viral vector, the

studied for decades.", "Novavaxs more traditional vaccine design may be able to win over some vaccine holdouts, but it remains to be seen how many people will get vaccinated now that Novavax is an option.", "Because Novavax is made of different ingredients than the mRNA vaccines, some individuals with known allergies to those ingredients may be able to get the Novavax vaccine instead.", "The Novavax vaccine doesnt contain polyethylene glycol, or PEG, for example, but does contain polysorbate, which is very similar to PEG.", "(Allergies to those ingredients have been suspected to be problematic in rare cases, but accumulating evidence suggests people with such allergies can be vaccinated without issue.)", "Another advantage of the Novavax vaccine is that it can be stored for a long time at regular refrigerator temperatures, similar to most standard vaccines  but unlike the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which must be kept frozen or in ultracold freezers for long-term storage.",

severity, not just hospitalizations or deaths, as Carlson suggested.", "When the data are adjusted for age and time elapsed since vaccination, Jewell noted in an email, the data shows the vaccinated individuals in this group to be very slightly better off than the unvaccinated (a vaccine effectiveness of 4%, rising to 5% with additional adjustments).", "The vaccine effectiveness numbers are not statistically significant, so theyre very uncertain.", "In reality, Jewell said, we simply dont know what the effectiveness is for this age group on this time scale since vaccination, although the evidence still points to vaccinated individuals being protected from the negative outcome.", "Not only is it inaccurate to conclude from this data that the vaccinated are at higher risk than the unvaccinated, but Carlson also cherry-picked the data.", "As Jewell noted, the unadjusted data he highlighted is the only such data in the table that shows a higher raw infection frequency among the

much of a threat  is inaccurate, too.", "Looking at the anticipated impacts of climate change on the ocean alone, we can expect increased coastal flooding due to sea level rise, changes in climate patterns due to higher ocean temperatures that affect the currents, and decreased marine biodiversity as higher levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide acidify the water.", "We have seen lots of changes

rather than 3), but that protection still exists, University of Pennsylvania infectious disease fellow Dr. Aaron Richterman told us in an email.", "There is a lot of solid evidence supporting this.", "He is the lead author on a study, published on June 6 in Clinical Infectious Diseases, which found that among health care workers, third doses of the mRNA vaccines still protected against omicron infection, although much less so than against delta.", "Compared to unvaccinated employees, those triply vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were 54% less likely to become infected during the omicron period, versus 93% less likely during the delta era.", "Similarly, those triply vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine were 46% less likely to become infected during the omicron period, versus 96% less likely during the delta era.", "The study did not identify a protective effect against infection with just two doses, but Richterman said he thought that was because of the small number of unvaccinated people in the study, which made the confidence interval very wide for those estimates.", "I would not take this to mean that two doses provide no protection, because when we look at the totality of evidence (including other studies with larger unvaccinated samples) there is some degree of measurable protection, he said.", "Notably, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in adolescents and kids, who became eligible for vaccination after adults, found that two doses of the vaccine reduced the risk of omicron infection by 31% among 5- to 11-year-olds and by 59% among teens 12 to 15 years old.", "A study of basketball players and staff in the NBA during the omicron era also found that those who received a booster dose were 57% less likely to become infected with the coronavirus than those who were eligible but had not received a booster, indicating vaccination can prevent omicron infection to some degree.", "Other data also show that the vaccines offer some protection, even if significantly reduced, against symptomatic infection with omicron.", "A study published in March in the New England Journal of Medicine, for example, found that in the U.K., two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were 65.5% effective at 2 to 4 weeks, falling to 8.8% after 25 or more weeks, with a Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna booster increasing protection.", "Richterman said it was indisputable at this point that vaccinated people are less likely to become infected than unvaccinated people.", "Other experts werent as definitive about that, but also thought it was likely to be true.", "I do think [vaccination] reduce[s] infection and there is some data out there to support this.", "I just dont think we have enough data yet to be

venous thromboembolism, DVT and/or PE affect up to 900,000 people in the U.S. each year and as many as 100,000 die, according to the CDC.", "Online posts, however, have misleadingly zeroed in on public health messages about these blood clots from the CDC and the pharmaceutical company Pfizer to falsely suggest that the COVID-19 vaccines, including the two mRNA vaccines, are a major cause of clotting.", "One COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the U.S.  the Johnson & Johnson vaccine  can cause a very particular blood clotting problem, but it is extremely rare.", "The condition has not been linked to either of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which account for the vast majority of doses administered in America.", "And in fact, evidence suggests COVID-19 vaccination prevents blood clots by protecting against COVID-19, which raises the risk of clotting.", "The original article, which was shared online on Facebook, is from the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website that is a frequent source of misinformation online.", "The article discusses a Super Bowl-themed tweet the CDC sent out in advance of the big game reminding the public that DVT can happen to anyone, including athletes.", "The article then proceeds to misleadingly link the tweet to COVID-19 vaccination.", "Of course, no one has ever heard of this frequent phenomenon before the COVID vaccines, the post reads.", "The CDC failed to mention on their website the COVID-19 vaccines as one of the factors that can increase this risk.", "But theres no reason for the CDCs DVT page to include anything about the COVID-19 vaccines.", "The page, which was last updated in February 2020, before any COVID-19 vaccines existed and before the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, describes the main symptoms and risk factors for the clots.", "It says, for example, that half of blood clots occur after hospitalization or surgery, and also highlights the risk of being immobile for long periods of time, such as when traveling or on bed rest.", "Some of these factors clearly can apply to athletes who get injured or who travel a lot, even if they otherwise are at lower risk because they are younger or more fit.", "The Gateway Pundit article goes on to say that the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine increases the risk of developing a rare and deadly blood clotting condition in the brain.", "The post then falsely contends that the mRNA vaccines have the same problem.", "(The issue has also been identified with the AstraZeneca vaccine, which, like the J&J vaccine, uses a viral vector design.", "But that vaccine has not been used in the U.S.) A study by Oxford University early last year also revealed that the number of people who developed blood clots after getting vaccinated was about the same for those who get Pfizer and Moderna vaccines as they are for the AstraZeneca, Market Watch reported, the post said.", "Its true that MarketWatch reported that about an early draft of a study, but thats a mischaracterization of the findings.", "All evidence suggests the mRNA vaccines do not cause clotting problems of any kind.", "Moreover, the rare clotting condition observed with the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines, known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, is different from the general concern about DVT in the population.", "TTS or VITT involves blood clotting combined with low levels of blood platelets, typically after five days up to a month after vaccination with select vaccines.", "As of Feb. 24, the CDC and FDA had confirmed 57 cases of TTS following the J&J vaccine, after more than 18.4 million doses, or around 3 cases per million doses.", "Women between the ages of 30 and 49 are more likely to be affected, but the condition is still rare.", "Dr. Adam C. Cuker, a hematologist with expertise in blood clots at Penn Medicine, called the post ridiculous and explained that while TTS/VITT can include blood clots in the legs or lungs, patients tend to present more frequently with clots in very unusual places, such as the cerebral sinuses in the brain or sometimes in the veins in the abdomen.", "In the general population, those are much, much less common places to develop clots than the legs and the lungs.", "But in this condition, its quite a bit more common to have clots in those unusual places, he said.", "Another key feature of TTS/VITT is that patients have antibodies to a protein called platelet factor 4.", "That also is distinct from garden variety blood clots  DVT, PE  where patients dont have those antibodies, Cuker said.", "So VITT is a very distinct entity that has a unique pathophysiology, a unique clinical presentation, a unique laboratory profile.", "The treatment is also different.", "Usually, blood clots are treated with an anticoagulant such as heparin, but that drug can make TTS/VITT worse.", "Informing health care providers of this difference is one reason why U.S. regulators decided to pause administration of the J&J vaccine back in April after the CDC and FDA identified six cases of TTS in younger women, as weve written.", "And contrary to the notion that the CDC is not providing information about TTS/VITT, the agency has warnings about it in multiple places on its website.", "In mid-December, the CDC began recommending the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines over the J&J vaccine because of the low, but real, risk of the condition.", "Importantly, no COVID-19 vaccine appears to cause blood clots generally, and the mRNA vaccines have not been associated with any kind of clotting problem.", "To date, CDC has detected no unusual or unexpected patterns of blood clots, such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following immunization, Dr. John Su, a medical officer for the CDCs Vaccine Safety Team, told us in a statement.", "He did, however, say there had been 9 TTS/VITT deaths that were likely caused by the J&J vaccine.", "There are very large population studies involving millions of people that show that there is no increase in risk with the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines in terms of thrombosis, Cuker said.", "So very, very clear evidence that those vaccines dont cause clots.", "In fact, vaccination might prevent blood clots.", "Theres also very clear evidence that having COVID increases the risk of thrombosis, Cuker said.", "So not only do the mRNA vaccines not increase the risk of thrombosis, but theres even a suggestion that they decrease it, he added, citing an Israeli study published in the New England Journal of Medicine evaluating the risks of infection with the coronavirus and the safety of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.", "Its not because the vaccines themselves are anticoagulant, its because they prevent COVID, Cuker said.", "They prevent people from getting as sick with COVID, and thats a major risk factor for clotting.", "As for the Oxford University study that purportedly found that the number of people who developed blood clots after getting vaccinated was about the same for those who get Pfizer and Moderna vaccines as they are for the AstraZeneca, the lead author of the paper told us that was misleading and misinterpreted.", "The study, which was published in eClinicalMedicine in July, used electronic health records to look back in time and evaluate the risk of cerebral venous thrombosis and portal vein thrombosis following coronavirus infection, compared with mRNA vaccination or influenza infection.", "The main finding was that both clots were much more common after COVID-19 than with vaccination or after a bout of flu.", "MarketWatch, the news site the Gateway Pundit cited, erroneously concluded from an early draft of the paper that blood clots were as prevalent with Pfizer and Moderna vaccine as with AstraZenecas, based on the studys estimate of 4.1 cerebral venous thrombosis events per million people for the mRNA vaccines and the European Medicines Agencys estimate of 5.0 events per million people for the AstraZeneca vaccine.", "But that conclusion is faulty.", "The draft specifically said that we cannot conclude that the mRNA vaccines studied here are associated with an increased risk of CVT and that far larger samples are needed to address this question.", "Maxime Taquet, the Oxford researcher who led the study, explained that his risk estimate for the mRNA vaccines was very uncertain and had broad confidence intervals  and therefore it does not mean that the mRNA vaccines show the same level of risk as the AstraZeneca vaccine.", "The broad confidence interval means that with our study we really cannot be sure what the true risk is among people receiving an mRNA vaccine and indeed it is perfectly compatible with the fact that the risk is not increased compared to the rest of the population, he said.", "The reason why the confidence interval (i.e.", "our degree of uncertainty) is so big is precisely because this is such a rare event and we need even larger populations to clearly estimate the risk.", "Because of the confusion, Taquet said his group decided to remove the point estimates in their published paper.", "The published paper, which was available well before the Gateway Pundit article was written, also makes this point, noting that the results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that these vaccines are not associated with an increased rate of CVT.", "Finally, the Gateway Pundit article attempts to tie in a Feb. 14 tweet from Pfizer, which also warned the public about DVT.", "The article implies Pfizers tweet might somehow be related to the CDCs tweet and COVID-19 vaccination.", "But there is no evidence that Pfizers message had anything to do with the agencys tweet  and as weve already established,

proportionally far fewer people ended up dying, as can be seen in the graphs above.", "While vaccines are not the only reason for this, they are a large reason.", "Now, as for the other supposed support for the claim, the post says: In the nine months before the introduction of mass vaccination (April 2020 through December 2020), there were about 356,000 COVID-19 deaths.", "In the nine months after the introduction of mass vaccination, there were 342,000 COVID-19 deaths (January 2021 through September 2021) and 182,000 additional COVID-19 deaths occurred in the four months that followed

from those two time periods provides no insight into whether the vaccines saved lives.", "There were so many variables that were in play in this time, Schaffner said.", "The before and after analysis assumes that circumstances were the same, but they werent, he said.", "Even more critically, most of the deaths that occurred after the vaccines became available were among unvaccinated people.", "A study looking at the effectiveness of the vaccines against both the delta and omicron variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 was published in the Jan. 28 issue of the CDCs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.", "The study found that, overall, those who had been fully vaccinated and boosted fared best against each variant, while those who were unvaccinated fared worst.", "During OctoberNovember, unvaccinated persons had 13.9 and 53.2 times the risks for infection and COVID-19associated death, respectively, compared with fully vaccinated persons who received booster doses, and 4.0 and 12.7 times the risks compared with fully vaccinated persons without booster doses, according to the study.", "The graph above details COVID-19 death rate by vaccination status, showing that those who were unvaccinated have made up the majority of deaths since vaccines became widely available in the spring of 2021.", "Physicians for Informed Consent didnt mention the difference between the death rates for the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated because it is an unproven hypothesis that appears to be based on data sets dependent on the testing practices of the subjects observed, Greg Glaser, general counsel and National Coalition director for Physicians for Informed Consent, told us in an email.", "He cited the second of five limitations explained in the recent CDC study, which said, this ecological study lacked multivariable adjustments, and causality could not be determined.", "Possible differences in testing, infection-derived immunity, waning of vaccine-derived immunity, or prevention behaviors by age and vaccination status might partly explain differences in rates between groups; trends are likely affected by temporal changes in testing or reporting.", "But Schaffner explained that what Glaser had pointed to was just a customary recognition of limitations that is included in scientific studies.", "Here you have people overinterpreting pretty standard language, he said, explaining that its called a limitations paragraph.", "Its an acknowledgement that you cant do a perfect study out in the world the way you might be able to in a lab.", "You have to acknowledge there are things out in the hurly burly of the world, he said, and including a limitations paragraph is a way of saying, no study is perfect and our study isnt, either.", "Schaffner noted that Physicians for Informed Consent did not include a limitations paragraph in its post.", "They dont account for the difference of delta and omicron, they dont account for the differences in testing practices, he said.", "Moreover, other studies, which have tried to control for a variety of differences in populations, have repeatedly found the vaccines to be highly effective.", "One U.K. study, for example, which evaluated vaccine effectiveness by comparing the vaccination status of people who tested positive for COVID-19 to those who had symptoms but tested negative, found the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be to 88% effective in preventing symptomatic disease against the delta variant.", "The bottom line, Schaffner said, is that public health authorities, infectious disease

it off.", "We know that they are effective in creating immunity because clinical trials showed more than 90% efficacy for the mRNA vaccines and 66% efficacy for the viral vector vaccine.", "Further

Morris, a biostatistician at the University of Pennsylvania told us in an email interview for this story.", "The extreme awareness, attention and concern about vaccine safety induced by the conditions of the pandemic in the past year could conceivably lead to much higher reporting than past years for other vaccines, he said.", "Thus, we cant rule out that the greater number or events in VAERs may be a result of increased reporting and not a function of a more dangerous vaccine.", "Part of this is standard for any new vaccine.", "When a new vaccine comes out, theres a lot of attention paid to whatever the profile is of those adverse events, so that the routine vaccinators understand what to expect as time goes on, Dr. Paul Beninger, a pharmacovigilance expert at the Tufts University School of Medicine, told us.", "He said that theres even a phenomenon known as the Weber effect, in which heightened awareness of a new vaccine leads to a spike in reports to safety systems such as VAERS, before rapidly declining.", "Reports to VAERS for one of the HPV vaccines, for example, shot up to triple the rate for all other vaccines combined between June 2006 and December 2008, likely related to media coverage of the new vaccine.", "But given that press coverage of COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccines is unprecedented in modern history  and that hundreds of millions of doses have been rolled out in less than a year, when most of the vaccines have been authorized for emergency use rather than a full approval  its reasonable to expect that any Weber effect would be even greater for the COVID-19 vaccines than for a typical vaccine.", "Indeed, part of the reason for the large number of reports is simply that the COVID-19 vaccines, which may involve as many as three doses, have been given to many millions of people.", "As of Dec. 21, more than 497 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in the U.S., according to the CDC.", "That total is still likely well below the total number of all vaccine doses given since 1990, when VAERS began, but its a large number of shots given in a very short period of time, when awareness of the vaccines has arguably never been higher.", "Beninger also said that with the COVID-19 vaccines, the people administering the vaccines have changed.", "In the past, the most experienced vaccinators have often been pediatricians.", "But he suspects a shift to more inexperienced vaccinators has also contributed to increased reporting in VAERS.", "Many people who are giving the vaccines are really very new to the whole vaccine paradigm, he said.", "Theyre inexperienced in giving them and theyre inexperienced in assessing them.", "They dont have the experience to say, I dont think this is related, so Im not going to report, he added.", "Theyre encouraged to report.", "Theres some inflation.", "As we pointed out back in February when we evaluated the similar claim about COVID-19 and flu vaccines, another factor potentially leading to more reporting than normal in VAERS is the population receiving the vaccine.", "While all adults and some children are now eligible to be vaccinated, the early emphasis on higher-risk individuals has meant far more of them are vaccinated.", "Dr. Paul A. Offit, a vaccine expert at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDAs vaccine advisory committee, told us then that because the vaccines protect against COVID-19 but were not designed to prevent everything else that happens in life, its expected that some number of people  especially the elderly  will die or have other complications, entirely coincidentally, after receiving a vaccine.", "Echoing Beninger, Dr. Robert Legare Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine who also evaluates vaccines, told us then that during flu season, many of the everyday deaths of people in nursing homes, for example, might have been reported to VAERS this year if someone received a COVID-19 vaccine.", "In the past, however, a similar death during flu season would not be reported because it would not be thought to be related to the vaccine.", "Morris, the University of Pennsylvania biostatistician, also suspects that social media and misinformation  including posts sharing this kind of misleading information  helped fuel reporting to VAERS after COVID-19 vaccination.", "He has spent a lot of time during the pandemic debunking bogus claims about vaccines, including distortions of government data, which he shares on Twitter and on his blog.", "False but sensationalistic claims on social media, such as the vaccines magnetizing people or changing a persons DNA, he said, fed the mania about vaccine safety, while so-called vaccine safety alarmists repeated anecdotal reports and analyzed VAERS data incorrectly to much the same effect.", "All of this frenzy, fed by social media in a way that has never been done with previous vaccine efforts, raised worry about vaccine safety, which certainly would have led more to report to VAERs, perhaps more fraudulent reports from people with an agenda, he said, but also from people who are simply more aware of VAERs and more mindful of potential vaccine effects, who normally would not have associated the side effect with vaccination.", "In that way, the posts creators themselves may have helped produce the very result that they are writing about  and are now using it to further undermine the vaccines.", "We asked the Department of Health and Human Services to explain why VAERS reports are so much higher for the COVID-19 vaccines, and the CDC replied, identifying many of the reasons as the outside experts.", "The three main reasons, the agencys immunization safety office told us, were the different reporting requirements, the large number of people vaccinated in a short amount of time, and heightened public awareness.", "COVID-19 vaccination is one of the top national news stories daily and VAERS has also been a frequent topic in media, the safety office told us.", "The agency said that it cannot always identify reports that are fraudulent, but that it had observed a huge increase in hoax reports to VAERS.", "These reports are obviously false, list celebrities or state outrageous claims, and often do not include contact information for follow-up, the CDC said.", "The hoax reports, which are deleted, make up less than 1% of all VAERS reports following COVID-19 vaccination, the agency said.", "Knowingly filing a false VAERS report is illegal and can result in fines or imprisonment.", "The CDC emphasized that VAERS is just one part of a large network of vaccine safety monitoring systems.", "It is important to note that VAERS is only one system among many that monitor the safety of US-licensed or authorized vaccines, the agency said in an email (emphasis is the CDCs).", "Each system has different strengths and weaknesses.", "VAERS, for example, is useful as a method of identifying purported safety problems, which must then be followed up in the governments active reporting systems or in population-level studies, Morris said.", "Those active systems include the CDCs Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time.", "[T]hese have affirmed many of the events with high reporting rates in VAERs have similar rates in vaccinated and matched unvaccinated cohorts, he said, so they show no evidence of association or causation by vaccines.", "Morris pointed to an Israeli study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that identified the increased risk of myocarditis, or heart inflammation, in recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, but also showed that the myocarditis risk for COVID-19 patients was higher  and found that many other serious adverse events thought to be potentially related to the vaccine were actually observed at similar rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated people.", "VAERS alone, however, cant be used to know the frequency of adverse events, as its website explains, or to make comparisons about the relative safety of different vaccines.", "Thats not the point of this database, Beninger said of VAERS.", "Its not a comparative study.", "Morris also said he had analyzed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data on the frequency of deaths among Medicare patients within two weeks of vaccination, and found that the rate in 2021 after the COVID-19 vaccines was roughly equivalent to the rate in 2018 to 2020 following the influenza vaccine.", "Both of these reflect a background rate of death.", "As he explains in a blog post and Twitter thread, a purported whistleblower had tried to use the data to argue that the death rate is twice as high after COVID-19 vaccination compared with the influenza vaccine.", "But that person failed to account for the fact that most Americans received a two-dose mRNA vaccine.", "As a result, far from proving the death claim, the data show the opposite  that theres no sign the COVID-19 vaccines are any different from the flu vaccine  and whats happening in VAERS is increased reporting rather than a sign that the vaccines are causing excess deaths.", "If the CMS data is accurate, Morris told us, it provides rock solid evidence that a larger proportion of deaths that occur after vaccination were reported to VAERS in 2021 for the COVID-19 vaccines than in prior years with other vaccines.", "Because no medical product is 100% safe, a very small number of people will be harmed by the COVID-19 vaccines, which is why its so critical to have a system such as VAERS and why its important to be transparent about the potential risks.", "But distorting and misusing VAERS figures to insinuate there are large safety concerns that have not been detected after administration of nearly half a billion doses in the U.S. is misleading.", "Editors note: SciChecks COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a

CDC safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates, a report of the panels May 17 meeting said.", "Still, the panel recommended that information about the potential adverse event be given to doctors., Later that month, the CDC posted a page on its website about pericarditis and myocarditis following vaccination, although it is unclear if the vaccine actually causes those heart problems.", "In June, the Food and Drug Administration added information about the potential risk to the fact sheets for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines., Public health officials continue to monitor reports of potential adverse reactions following the vaccines, including reports made to the governments Vaccine Adverse Reporting System, or VAERS, to determine whether there may be previously unknown risks., As of Nov. 24, 2021, VAERS had received 1,949 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis among people ages 30 and younger, according to the CDC.", "On that date, more than 196 million people had been fully vaccinated and nearly 567 million doses of the vaccine had been administered., After officials followed up on those VAERS reports, including medical record reviews, the CDC and FDA confirmed 1,071 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis.", "The CDC is still investigating whether or not those illnesses have a relationship to COVID-19 vaccination., The CDC has noted that reports of those conditions following vaccination are rare and [m]ost patients with myocarditis or pericarditis who received care responded well to medicine and rest and felt better quickly.,  George Peterson, 37, former bodybuilder and Classic Physique competition winner of the 2019 Arnold Classic, was found dead

Miller, who attempted CPR and called the police., We could find no public record of Petersons vaccination status, and Good Sciencingdid not provide any evidence he was vaccinated., We have emailed the Orange County coroners office for more information, but no cause of death or details of an autopsy have been shared at this time.,  Carl Madsen, 71, who worked as an NFL official for over two decades, died on Oct. 28 after suffering from an apparent medical issue while driving home from a game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tennessee Titans., According to the Associated Press, the Metro

different from those from other variants.", "According to a Dec. 4 report on the first set of likely omicron cases at Steve Biko/Tshwane District Hospital Complex in Pretoria, South Africa, fewer patients have needed supplemental oxygen than before, and more cases are what physicians there are calling incidental cases, or instances of COVID-19 that were detected in people who were found to be infected when they underwent the required testing for hospital admission, but were admitted for another reason.", "The overall in-hospital death rate is also lower  6.6%, over the past two weeks, compared with 17% over the past 18 months.", "Its too early to be able to determine the precise severity of disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, explained in a Dec. 7 coronavirus briefing, in reviewing the existing evidence on the topic.", "But it appears that with the cases that are seen, we are not seeing a very severe profile of disease.", "It might be  and I underscore might  be less severe, as shown by the ratio of hospitalizations per number of new cases, he continued.", "However, this could be influenced by the fact that many in this particular cohort are young individuals.", "The hospital stay seems to be less and the use of supplemental oxygen needs to be less.", "Again, I caution you.", "These are still preliminary.", "Because hospitalizations and deaths are lagging indicators, Fauci said, it would likely take at least another couple of weeks before scientists have a good handle on the relative severity of omicron, and a few weeks thereafter to have a really good handle on the subject.", "Another issue making it difficult to tell whether the apparently less severe cases truly reflect a drop in the viruss virulence is COVID-19 immunity in the population, either from previous infection or vaccines.", "South Africa has a relatively low vaccination rate, but some experts estimate that almost all South Africans have already had COVID-19.", "If thats the case, then it could well be that the reduced severity reflects the fact that most people are already largely protected from severe disease, even if they are susceptible to reinfection with this variant.", "The Facebook post also baselessly claims that the omicron variant is not easy to detect correctly and suggests that cases of the variant are difficult to diagnose with current tests.", "The result of nasal swab test for COVID-Omicron is usually negative, and the number of false negative cases of nasopharyngeal test is increasing, the post reads.", "There is no evidence that the omicron variant is causing COVID-19 tests to fail on any large scale.", "Dozens of countries around the world have been able to identify omicron infections by sequencing the viruses present in specimens that have tested positive with existing diagnostic tests.", "The widely used PCR tests continue to detect infection, including infection with Omicron, the World Health Organization said in its Nov. 28 update on the variant, referring to polymerase chain reaction tests that check patient samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material.", "The Food and Drug Administration has warned that one particular PCR test authorized and used in the U.S. is expected to be unable to detect the omicron variant, since the test only looks for one short stretch of the viral sequence, and omicron happens to have a deletion in that spot.", "But the test is just one of many available molecular tests  the agency has authorized 267, as of Dec. 9  and is not thought to be used for high-volume testing.", "(The FDA identified one other authorized PCR test that would be affected, but it hasnt been distributed to anyone.)", "PCR tests that check for other parts of the viral genome or at multiple different spots are not expected to have problems identifying omicron infections.", "As we have explained before, many omicron viruses have a deletion in the S, or spike, gene, that affects a few popular PCR tests.", "But its turning out to be a feature rather than a bug.", "Because of the deletion, many omicron samples wont test positive for the S gene  unlike with most delta samples  but are positive for the other two gene targets.", "This means the test still works to diagnose omicron patients, while at the same time flagging potential omicron cases.", "As the WHO writes in its Dec. 7 weekly epidemiological update, this S-gene target failure (SGTF) can be used as a marker suggestive of Omicron, although the agency says sequencing should be done to confirm that, since other variants are known to have the deletion.", "While evaluations are continuing, there is also no evidence to indicate that more rapid but less sensitive antigen tests, which look for the presence of viral proteins in a sample, are unable to detect omicron infections.", "The WHOs update notes that preliminary evidence from labs independently confirms that antigen tests can accurately diagnose omicron infections, and that as of Dec. 7, there have been no reported misdiagnoses (false negative results) for any WHO-authorized diagnostic test because of the omicron variant.", "South Africas Coetzee, in her interview with Canadas Global News, also said that antigen tests were definitely still working against omicron, although she cautioned against testing too soon once symptoms develop.", "While much of the post is unsubstantiated, particularly its claims about disease severity, it urges readers to be cautious of the new variant.", "Please be careful, avoid crowded places, keep a distance of 1.5m even in open places, wear a double-layer mask, wear suitable masks, and wash your hands frequently when everyone has no symptoms (coughing or sneezing), the post reads.", "Those are all recommended precautions that public health officials are emphasizing to protect people from both omicron and the still-dominant delta, so thats good advice.", "Its worth noting that even if omicron infection results in less severe disease, if its more transmissible, it could still end up hurting more people.", "If theyre allowed to spread unchecked, even though theyre not individually more virulent or lethal, they just generate more cases, they put pressure on the health system and more people die, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHOs health emergencies programme, said of coronavirus variants during a Dec. 8 press conference.", "The post, however, doesnt mention vaccination, which is the single best way to protect yourself

acknowledged that serious adverse events are minuscule, but then she adds that one out of 30,000 people experience such serious problems.", "There is no evidence that any rate of adverse events is that high in the general population, as numbers above show.", "But it may be true for subpopulations  such as the reported incidence for myocarditis for younger men.", "In a vaccine safety update presented by the CDCs Vaccine Safety Team to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Oct. 21, Dr. Tom Shimabukuro provided data on myocarditis and myocarditis with pericarditis and wrote

(under age 20) males after 2nd dose mRNA vaccine is [greater than] 100 cases per million doses.", "For this reason, the fact sheets for both mRNA vaccines have been revised to contain a warning that reads: Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received the vaccine, more commonly in males under 40 years of age than among females and older males.", "In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of vaccine.", "The chance of having this occur is very low.", "You should seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms after receiving the vaccine: chest pain, shortness of breath, feelings of a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart.", "It is important to note, however, that COVID-19 and other viruses can also cause myocarditis.", "A study published by the CDC in early September said patients with

we said, the data on COVID-19 infections in the U.S. show the risks of getting the disease and dying from it are higher among the unvaccinated.", "And studies show that while the effectiveness of the vaccines against infection has dropped a bit with the delta variant, the vaccines still offer robust protection.", "For instance, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in late July by U.K. researchers found that the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 88% effective in preventing symptomatic disease against delta.", "Rodgers said he was taking the antiparasitic drug ivermectin,

help.", "You know, its basically the expensive versions of ivermectin.", "Why do people hate ivermectin?", "Not just because [former President Donald] Trump championed it, because its a cheap generic.", "You cant make any money off of it, Rodgers said.", "As weve written, the National Institutes of Health counts over 70 studies on the safety and effectiveness of ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19 in humans, but the data on the drug hasnt been conclusive.", "Multiple large trials are continuing to assess it.", "Health officials have warned people not to self-medicate and not to

intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, head lice, and skin conditions.", "One large, randomized trial didnt find a benefit to using ivermectin for high-risk nonhospitalized adults, but it did

announced positive trial results for easy-to-take pills to combat the disease, but the antiviral medications are very different from ivermectin, contrary to Rodgers false claim, which has been

knowledge, theres been zero long-term studies around sterility or fertility issues around the vaccines.", "So that was definitely something I was worried about.", "While its true that there havent been long-term studies, there is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines have a negative impact on fertility.", "Social media has been awash with claims of harm, but there is nothing to support them.", "As we wrote after some bogus posts claimed that the vaccines could cause mass male infertility, there is no data to back that idea, and in fact, studies to date show that COVID-19 vaccination does not have an effect on sperm.", "A June 17 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, for example, found no significant decreases in any sperm parameter in healthy men after they received their second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.", "Its possible that sperm counts might fall temporarily if a vaccinated person experienced a fever, but thats not specific to the COVID-19 shots.", "That could also occur  and to a worse degree  if someone fell ill with the coronavirus.", "The CDC has also noted that there is no evidence that any vaccine has a detrimental effect on male

claims about natural immunity.", "Im gonna have the best immunity possible now, based on the 2.5 million person study from Israel, that the people who get COVID and recover have the most robust immunity, he said.", "Later, he repeated the claim.", "Theres a lot to natural immunity.", "And natural immunity has not been a part of the conversation.", "But the latest studies  and I have 30 of them that I can go through  talk about how important natural immunity is, he said.", "And actually, if youve gotten COVID, and recovered from it, that thats the best boost to immunity you can have.",

of gain-of-function  or what the agency terms research involving enhanced pathogens of pandemic potential  because these bat coronaviruses had not been shown to infect humans.", "It therefore was not subject to review under the Department of Health and Human Services framework for enhanced pathogens.", "But, he added, out of an abundance of caution and as an additional layer of oversight, the

10-fold increase in viral growth, to determine whether the research aims should be re-evaluated or new biosafety measures should be enacted.", "EcoHealth failed to report this finding right away, as

COVID-19 pandemic, as weve established.", "For its part, EcoHealth disputes NIHs characterization.", "EcoHealth Alliance is working with the NIH to promptly address what we believe to be a misconception about the grants reporting requirements and what the data from our research showed, said Robert Kessler, the groups spokesperson, in a statement provided to FactCheck.org.", "These data were reported as soon as we were made aware, in our year 4 report in April 2018.", "NIH reviewed those data and did not indicate that secondary review of our research was required, in fact year 5 funding was allowed to progress without delay.", "The progress report notes that its experiments in mice were continued in year 5.", "In his statement, Kessler confirmed that the organizations grant was not ongoing.", "Collins similarly told CNN that the grant had been suspended since last year.", "Although Tabak does not say in his letter that the EcoHealth experiment in question was gain-of-function, numerous Republicans interpreted it to be such an admission.", "As weve written, gain-of-function can refer to a lot of scientific experiments that aim to add a function to a virus or organism that is entirely benign, such as making a viral stock easier to grow to better increase the yield for a vaccine.", "What is controversial is research that could make viruses or other infectious microbes more dangerous, either by increasing their transmissibility or virulence.", "Some people have argued that very little or none of this research should be allowed because it is too risky, while others say the work needs to be done to better prepare for events such as pandemics.", "Recognizing the debate, the U.S. government instituted a pause in 2014 on new funding for research that may be reasonably anticipated to enhance the transmissibility or virulence of influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses.", "Three years later, the government lifted the moratorium and unveiled a new framework for making funding decisions for these types of projects on a case-by-case basis.", "The framework pertains to funding decisions on proposed research that is reasonably anticipated to create, transfer, or use what it calls enhanced potential pandemic pathogens, or ePPPs.", "A potential pandemic pathogen, or PPP, is one that is both likely highly transmissible and likely capable of wide and uncontrollable spread in human populations and likely highly virulent and likely to cause significant morbidity and/or mortality in humans.", "An ePPP is a PPP resulting from the enhancement of the transmissibility and/or virulence of a pathogen.", "Even if a virus has the potential to spark a pandemic, it would not be considered enhanced if it is found in nature.", "This formal definition differs in a few possible respects from what is described in the grant progress report  namely, that the research would need to be expected to produce an ePPP and that the virus in question would have to be likely highly virulent and transmissible, specifically in humans.", "The NIH argues that the EcoHealth Alliance experiments, although they produced a more virulent virus in mice, did not meet that definition.", "The bat coronaviruses used in this research have not been shown to infect humans, and the experiments were not reasonably expected to increase transmissibility or virulence in humans, an NIH spokesperson told the New York Times following the release of the letter, adding that the experiments would not have triggered a review.", "The NIH says it has only ever greenlighted three projects under its ePPP framework.", "Its worth noting that, as before with their 2017 experiments, the researchers were working with WIV1, a virus that already had the ability to bind to human ACE2, so swapping in spike proteins from other viruses was aimed at replacing a function, not giving the virus a new ability, as Kings College London virologist Stuart Neil has pointed out before.", "The NIH also explains on its website that WIV1 is not known to cause infection in humans but has been shown in the laboratory to infect both human cells and ACE2 transgenic mice, making it an ideal tool to use for these studies.", "We reached out to the NIH for more information but did not receive a reply.", "Other experts disagree.", "Richard Ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University who is a vocal critic of gain-of-function research, sided with Republicans about the interpretation of the letter.", "NIH corrects untruthful assertions by NIH Director Collins and NIAID Director Fauci that NIH had not funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan, he wrote on Twitter.", "Multiple other experts told the Intercept, which published other similar documents last month after suing the NIH, that the work EcoHealth Alliance was doing would be considered gain-of-function, although one said it wasnt problematic.", "Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewans Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, told the Intercept that the research clearly was not gain-of-function because its not possible to conclude the viruses would be harmful to humans.", "You cant predict that these viruses would be more pathogenic, or even pathogenic at all in people, she said.", "They also did not study transmissibility.", "Still other experts say regardless of the technical definition of gain-of-function, the research described in the progress report strikes them as too risky and raises concerns about the NIH review process.", "Fauci has defended himself, responding in an Oct. 24 ABC News interview to claims from Sen. Paul that he lied by saying that neither he nor Collins lied or misled anyone because he was operating under the framework.", "There are people who interpret it that way, he said, referring to those who view the work as gain-of-function, but when you look at the framework under which the guidance is, that is not the case.", "Rasmussen said that the committees tweet was wrong since the letter clearly states that this wasnt GOF by the P3CO definition, which for NIH-funded work is the relevant standard, referring to gain-of-function and the policy framework for handling such research.", "But she also criticized EcoHealth, saying the lack of transparency & failure to comply with NIH requirements is indefensible.", "Collins pinned blame on EcoHealth as well.", "They messed up here.", "Theres going to be some consequences for EcoHealth, he told the Washington Post in an interview.", "But he also acknowledged that this new information did not mean anything that happened was risky.", "Had the group reported its result earlier, he said, it would not have been a reason to sort of hit the panic button and say my god this is dangerous stuff.", "In this one instance, they failed to report the results of an experiment that they should have told us about immediately, Collins also said of EcoHealth Alliance in an interview with CNN.", "This is not a circumstance where I think you could say there was a major failure that put human lives at risk.", "Clarification, Nov. 1: We have updated this item to clarify that the 2014 grant awarded to EcoHealth Alliance was renewed in 2019.", "Editors note: SciChecks COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.", "The foundation has no control over FactCheck.orgs editorial decisions, and the views expressed in our articles do not necessarily reflect the views of the foundation.", "The goal of the project is to increase exposure to accurate information about COVID-19 and vaccines, while decreasing the impact of misinformation."], "issues": ["coronavirus"], "image_data": [{"image_src": null, "image_caption": null}], "data": [{"sentence": "Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic, NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said in an Oct. 20 statement, referring to an analysis posted to the NIAIDs website.

may be effective and the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks.", "For these EUAs, the FDA went further and required at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccines safety and efficacy in a clear and compelling manner.", "The agency also wanted to see at least two months of follow-up data on half or more of the participants, and

capability to track a persons location, he said, but smartphones are often equipped with apps that track their users locations.", "As with existing apps that track location, though, its the users choice to agree to those terms and use the app.", "Its also important to note that the sensor cant detect pathogens, Hepburn said, so it couldnt detect COVID-19.", "But it could potentially sense

that high-risk people clean their own spaces, but the CDC notes that could be challenging if those individuals have disabilities or cant move around easily.", "Similarly, on the recommendation that each green zone have a dedicated bathroom for high-risk people, the agency notes that the paper also advises not initiating any new construction, but that there are unlikely to be enough preexisting facilities.", "The CDC also raises the concern that more people than expected in displacement camps might be considered higher risk, further complicating the execution of the approach; that camps might need to continue the strategy for a prolonged time; and that shielding might have negative psychological impacts that could worsen mental health, among others.", "Fulce explained that the CDC

of studies, particularly in labs, showing that face masks can help reduce transmission  though such studies do have their limitations.", "Also, the material, layers and fit of a mask all factor into how effective it is.", "Its worth noting that masks are not considered to be foolproof  but instead one measure to help limit the spread of COVID-19.", "For more information on the research surrounding face masks, see our SciCheck story The Evolving Science of Face Masks and COVID-19.", "Stock claims the COVID-19 vaccines fight the virus wrong and let the virus become worse than it would with native infection.", "He blames outbreaks of COVID-19 on antibody-mediated viral enhancement, a condition done when vaccines work wrong, as they did in every coronavirus study done in animals on coronaviruses after the SARS outbreak and done in respiratory syncytial virus.", "As weve explained before, that issue  known as antibody-dependent enhancement of disease, or ADE  occurs when a previous infection or vaccination generates antibodies that dont neutralize the virus but instead enhance the virus ability to infect cells, which can lead to a worse illness instead of preventing it.", "But ADE hasnt been an issue in the animal studies and clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines  not to mention their real-world rollout.", "The phenomenon in question was indeed seen in a vaccine trial in the 1960s against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.", "Regarding vaccine work on previous coronaviruses, a 2012 study found that vaccine candidates for the coronavirus behind the SARS outbreak of 2003 caused mice to develop eosinophilia  a high count of a type of white blood cells  when exposed to the live virus.", "Similar issues were encountered in mice tested with a vaccine candidate for MERS, another disease caused by a coronavirus.", "Thats why vaccine experts publicly discussed the need to be cognizant of potential enhancement issues when COVID-19 vaccine research got underway in early 2020.", "Antibody-dependent Enhancement was one of the questions of concern before development and testing of vaccines, Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center, told us in an email.", "But if anything, the data show just the opposite.", "Breakthrough infections are milder in general to infections in the unvaccinated, particularly around hospitalizations and deaths.", "The vast majority of hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 continue to be among those not fully vaccinated, as a recent analysis of state-level breakthrough infection data by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows.", "(Of course, as weve explained, when more and more of the population becomes vaccinated, the proportion of cases among vaccinated individuals will also rise.)", "In proposing that the vaccines worsen disease, Stock also makes the false claim that the July outbreak of COVID-19 in Provincetown, Massachusetts, was somehow due to the vaccines.", "That is why you are seeing an outbreak right now, he said.", "75% of people who had COVID-19-positive symptom cases in Barnstable, Massachusetts, outbreak, were fully vaccinated, he added, to applause.", "Later, he iterated his claim, saying, This vaccine was supposedly going to make all this go away, but it suddenly managed to make an outbreak of COVID-19 develop in the middle of the summer.", "But there is no evidence that when outbreaks occur that theyre because of or made worse by vaccination.", "On the contrary, experts say the vaccines are doing their job, keeping outbreaks from otherwise being more severe.", "Here, Stock is distorting the findings of a paper published on July 30 in the CDCs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which found that 74% of the 469 people included in the study who were infected with the coronavirus after being in Provincetown in the first half of July were vaccinated.", "As we have previously explained, however, the 74% is misleading without more context, and doesnt mean that the vaccines dont work.", "Thats because even with a very effective vaccine you still expect some COVID-19 cases in vaccinated people  and the proportion of cases among the immunized can be high if much of the population has been vaccinated.", "The 74% needs to be put in the context that a very high proportion of the people exposed were vaccinated, William P. Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvards T.H.", "Chan School of Public Health, told us.", "It suggests that in the absence of vaccination the outbreak would have been much larger.", "While the Provincetown outbreak has garnered a lot of news coverage, its far from the only outbreak of COVID-19 in the country, as Stock incorrectly implies.", "COVID-19 cases are on the rise across the U.S. as the highly contagious delta variant has spread, but particularly so in places with low vaccination rates.", "Only a tiny fraction of people who have been vaccinated have died or fallen seriously ill from COVID-19, according to federal and state data.", "Stock also falsely claimed that no vaccine  ever stops infection and that vaccines do nothing for transmission, citing an outbreak of mumps in the National Hockey League in 2014.", "No vaccine prevents you from getting [an] infection, he said.", "You get infected, you shed pathogen.", "This is especially true of viral respiratory pathogens.", "You just dont get symptomatic from it.", "So you cannot stop spread, you cannot make these numbers that youve planned on get better by doing any of the things youre doing.", "Its true that most vaccines arent able to prevent infection.", "But as weve written, thats not a reason to skip vaccination, since the vaccines still work to protect against disease, which is their primary purpose.", "And its false to claim that no vaccines prevent infection or that vaccines cant stop the spread of diseases.", "Some vaccines, such as those for the measles, hepatitis A and human papillomavirus, or HPV, can prevent infection since they trigger sterilizing immunity, which is when antibodies glom onto a pathogen and remove it before it has a chance to enter cells and set up an infection.", "Many other vaccines that arent able to produce sterilizing immunity nevertheless can reduce transmission because vaccinated people typically shed less virus, for example, making them less contagious.", "And in fact, there is evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines do reduce infection and transmission, although not completely  hence the recommendation from public health officials to continue to take some precautions, particularly when transmission levels in the community are high or if you or those around you are more vulnerable to COVID-19.", "For example, as the CDC outlines in its scientific brief on vaccination, subsequent data from some of the vaccine clinical trials and multiple studies of real-world effectiveness suggest that immunization reduces asymptomatic infection.", "One study from the U.K., published in June in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that household transmission was 40% to 50% lower from infected vaccinated people than from infected unvaccinated people.", "More than 90% of the vaccinated people in the study had received only one dose of a two-dose vaccine.", "The CDC recently changed its guidance on masking for the vaccinated in light of the delta variant, based in part on findings from the Provincetown outbreak showing that, at the time of diagnosis, infected vaccinated and unvaccinated people harbored similar amounts of viral RNA.", "But as weve noted, viral RNA is not the same as infectious virus, and its unlikely that infected vaccinated people would be as contagious as their unvaccinated peers.", "Even if they are, vaccinated people would still be less likely to spread the virus, since theyre less likely to be infected in the first place.", "Throughout his speech, Stock was also focused on saying that no one can make this virus go away, contrasting the situation to that of smallpox, which was eradicated more than 40 years ago.", "But this is neither news, nor is it relevant to the main purpose of vaccination, which is to get the current pandemic under control with the fewest lives lost.", "Scientists have suspected for some time that the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, would not just go away, as we wrote in May 2020.", "Contrary to Stocks claim that people who recovered from COVID-19 get no benefit from vaccination at all, studies show the COVID-19 vaccines provide an immunity boost to those who previously recovered from an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.", "For instance, a study by U.K. researchers published Aug. 10 in the journal Science Translational Medicine found that two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in previously infected individuals increased the immune response to variants of the coronavirus, including the beta and gamma variants.", "The researchers evaluated blood samples from 45 health care workers who had been fully vaccinated, comparing a group that had a previous infection with the novel coronavirus with a group that had no evidence of a past infection.", "The authors noted that past studies had found a single vaccine dose can improve the immune response of previously infected people.", "(We wrote about such studies here.)", "But this research found that natural infection followed by a two-dose regimen of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine increased antibody concentration and neutralization of the gamma and beta variants at a comparable level as to the original virus.", "Our data provide compelling evidence that neutralizing potency and breadth is further increased following a vaccine boost, and this effect is even greater if the vaccine recipient has had prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, the study said.", "In the video, Stock said that studies on his flash drive show that people who have recovered from COVID infection actually

unclear to what studies Stock is referring.", "A group called Hancock County Patriots listed several studies in an online posting about Stocks remarks.", "Among those studies, one would be relevant to this issue, but it doesnt support Stocks claim.", "That study, published on July 14 in Cell Reports Medicine, evaluated 254 COVID-19 patients over several months, finding that most mounted broad immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 for up to 250 days.", "The researchers, from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Emory University in Atlanta, didnt evaluate the impact of vaccination on those patients.", "They did say the findings suggested that individuals could mount a rapid immune response if they were exposed to COVID-19 again or vaccinated.", "An early version of the paper, posted in April before peer-review, included this sentence: Thus, recovered COVID-19 patients are likely to better defend against the variants than persons who have not been infected but have been immunized with spike-containing vaccines only.", "But that sentence was removed before the paper was published, and the lead author of the study told PolitiFact.com that the sentence had been taken out of context.", "Kristen Cohen, a senior staff scientist in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, told PolitiFact.com the sentence was a hypothesis, not a definitive finding, in the discussion section.", "We did not intend to argue that infected people do not need to get vaccinated or that their immune responses are superior, Cohen told PolitiFact.", "Another study in which Cohen and colleagues at the Fred Hutchinson Center participated, published in Science on June 25, found that vaccination may offer a valuable boost to the immune responses against variant viruses of those who had previously been infected.", "That study analyzed blood samples from 15 previously infected individuals both before and after one or two doses of the mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, and it analyzed samples from 13 individuals without prior infection after two vaccine doses.", "It found that a single shot provided the immunity boost for the previously infected.", "Our study highlights the importance of vaccinating both uninfected and previously infected persons to elicit cross-variant neutralizing antibodies, the authors said.", "Also, a real-world retrospective study by the CDC in Kentucky found unvaccinated residents who were infected with the coronavirus in 2020 had a 2.34 times higher risk of being reinfected in May and June 2021, compared with those who were fully vaccinated.", "The study, published Aug. 6 in the CDCs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, said it suggested that among previously infected persons, full vaccination is associated with reduced likelihood of reinfection, and, conversely, being unvaccinated is associated with higher likelihood of being reinfected.", "The CDC noted this was a study on one state with a short reinfection period and that more research was needed.", "Its possible Stock was referring to an unpublished study, which hasnt been peer-reviewed, that followed employees at the Cleveland Clinic Health System for five months, beginning on Dec. 16, 2020, the day vaccination against COVID-19 began.", "It found that none of the 2,579 previously infected workers got COVID-19 again over those five months.", "The only group that did see an increase in infections were the previously uninfected who remained unvaccinated.", "The observations led the authors to conclude: Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who have not been infected before.", "But the Cleveland Clinic issued a statement saying it recommended that everyone who is eligible for the vaccine receive it.", "The statement noted that researchers dont know how long the immune system protects against reinfection, that the population in the study was younger and healthier than the general population, and that more research was needed.", "Stock suggested that an anti-parasitic drug called ivermectin could be used along with supplements to effectively treat COVID-19, a claim similar to one weve addressed before.", "I can tell you, Stock said in the video, having treated over 15 COVID-19 patients, that between active loading with vitamin D, ivermectin and zinc, that there is not a single person who has come anywhere near the hospital.", "But available data on ivermectin hasnt shown a benefit in reducing symptom duration, hospitalization or mortality for COVID-19 patients, Dr. David Boulware, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota, told us in an email.", "As weve explained before, neither the World Health Organization nor the National Institutes of Health has recommended the use of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19, and Merck, which manufactures the drug, has similarly noted that there is no meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease.", "Ivermectin does have antiviral properties, and its among a few repurposed medicines that the NIH is studying for use in COVID-19 patients.", "But the Food and Drug Administration hasnt approved it to treat any viral infections to date.", "The FDA has, however, warned against the use of veterinary ivermectin since patients have been hospitalized after taking a version of the drug intended for horses as interest in it as treatment for COVID-19 has grown.", "Boulware also addressed Stocks claim about vitamin D, noting that observational data have limitations.", "Its true that vitamin D, which is mostly associated with bone health, plays a part in the immune system.", "But that doesnt mean its a panacea for COVID-19, as weve explained before.", "Having a low vitamin D level is associated with bad outcomes in COVID-19, Boulware wrote.",

delta, and most show the vaccines are working largely as expected.", "A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 21 by Public Health England, for example, found that after the two recommended doses, the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in preventing symptomatic disease in the U.K. fell only slightly, to 88.0% against delta from 93.7% against the alpha variant

after a single dose, underscoring the importance of receiving both immunizations.", "In an unpublished study that has not yet been peer reviewed, the U.K. health agency also found the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was very effective at preventing hospitalization with the delta variant, reducing the risk by 94% after one dose and by 96% after two.", "Other countries have reported similar preliminary results.", "In an unpublished study from Ontario, Canada, researchers estimated the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against symptomatic infection with delta to be 87% after two doses, while a report from Scotland, published in the British medical journal the Lancet, pegged the figure at 79% for infection with delta.", "The Canadian report also found that one dose of the Moderna vaccine was 70% effective in preventing symptomatic disease and 95% effective in preventing hospitalization or death; there were too few COVID-19 cases among the vaccinated to estimate the effectiveness after two doses.", "Meanwhile, in Israel, the health ministry released preliminary, unpublished information on July 5 suggesting that with the rise of the delta variant in the nation, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was now 64% effective against infection or symptomatic illness, but still 93% effective in preventing serious illness and hospitalization.", "The ministry had previously estimated the vaccine to be 97% effective against symptomatic disease, with similar levels of protection against hospitalization and death, at a time when the alpha variant made up the vast majority of COVID-19 cases.", "McCullough, therefore, is right that Israel estimated the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine effectiveness at only about 60 to 70%.", "But that is still a substantial amount of protection  and McCullough neglects to mention the vaccines excellent ability to prevent the worst outcomes of COVID-19.", "In late July, the ministry further reduced its vaccine effectiveness estimate for symptomatic COVID-19 to 40.5%, but once again, found protection against severe disease to remain robust  88.0% effective against hospitalization and 91.4% effective against severe COVID-19.", "Its worth mentioning that some experts doubt the accuracy of the Israeli estimates, which are outliers compared with the other results and rely on a different methodology.", "In its July 27 scientific brief on the vaccines, the CDC said more technical information is needed to allow full interpretation.", "The most recent Israeli figure, in particular, is based on a small number of cases over a

Feinberg, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern Universitys Feinberg School of Medicine, told us.", "The figure also fails a basic sniff test.", "If 82% of pregnant people were actually miscarrying after being vaccinated, it would be very obvious that there were problems with the vaccines.", "[T]his is a ridiculous claim and simply not observed clinically,

systems  v-safe, a smartphone-based health checker run by the CDC, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System  for pregnant people who had received the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines.", "It concluded there were no obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, while acknowledging that additional follow-up of pregnant women, especially those vaccinated early in pregnancy, was needed.", "The incorrect miscarriage calculation stems from a misinterpretation of the v-safe data, which included 3,958 people enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry who had been vaccinated with a first dose prior to Feb. 28.", "CDC researchers contacted these individuals for information about their pregnancies, and from interviews performed as of March 30, 827 people had completed them, either through birth, pregnancy loss or induced abortion.", "Of these completed pregnancies, 104, or 12.6%, had experienced a spontaneous abortion, also known as a miscarriage, before 20 weeks.", "Online posts, however, have latched onto a footnote in table 4 that says 700 of the 827 participants received their first eligible dose in the third trimester.", "Because these participants couldnt have miscarried before 20 weeks, the posts argue, the 700 people should be subtracted from the 827, making the calculation 104 miscarriages out of 127 pregnancies, or 82%.", "Dont tell me you did the math until you took out the 700 people out who got their first dose in the 3rd trimester, the one Instagram post, now removed, reads.", "Experts, however, say that doing the math that way is incorrect.", "[T]he quoted rate of [82%] is not the miscarriage rate, Viki Male, a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, said on Twitter.", "It just tells us that we cant go from the first trimester to giving birth to a healthy baby in three months.", "[T]his is a bit of a meaningless statistic, since the only way you can complete your pregnancy within 3 months, starting in the first trimester, is to miscarry, she added.", "And presumably the only reason that rate isnt 100% is because some people vaccinated at the end of the 2nd trimester completed their pregnancies within 3 months by giving birth.", "In a statement to FactCheck.org, the CDC also said such percentages are erroneous.", "This is not an appropriate calculation based on the data available because more than a 1000 pregnancies were ongoing and outcome data was not available at the time of the report, the agency said, adding that it will continue to study the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on pregnancies and closely monitor any safety concerns.", "Update, Nov. 8: When we first wrote about this claim, the CDC had presented its 12.6% spontaneous abortion figure, based on 104 miscarriages out of 827 completed pregnancies, in table 4 along with a published incidence, or normally expected rate, of 10% to 26%.", "The agency has since acknowledged that it shouldnt have tried to calculate a risk estimate since it lacked follow-up data for the vast majority of women vaccinated early in their pregnancies, and corrected its paper on Oct. 14.", "Given the correction, we removed a paragraph from our original story citing the 12.6% figure.", "A footnote for table 4 now reads: No denominator was available to calculate a risk estimate for spontaneous abortions, because at the time of this report, follow-up through 20 weeks was not yet available for 905 of the 1224 participants vaccinated within 30 days before the first day of the last menstrual period or in the first trimester.", "Furthermore, any risk estimate would need to account for gestational weekspecific risk of spontaneous abortion.", "However, this doesnt lend any credence to the 82% figure, which is still an incorrect calculation  and is still circulating online in newer social media posts highlighting the CDCs correction.", "Other data provided in the paper allow for a different calculation that avoids the problem of including participants who were vaccinated after 20 weeks, although it has limitations.", "[T]he real way to calculate this is to look at all patients who received the vaccine, not just the patients who completed pregnancy, Northwesterns Feinberg said.", "Data in the paper show that a total of 1,224 people were vaccinated around the time of conception or in the first trimester, so 104 miscarriages out of this total is a miscarriage frequency of 8.5%, she said.", "And correctly limiting it to just the 96 participants who had a first trimester loss to match the denominator drops the percentage to 7.8%.", "Feinberg said she didnt know why the CDC didnt report this frequency instead.", "Martha Sharan, a CDC spokesperson, told FactCheck.org that doing the calculation as suggested by Feinberg makes some sense, but would be an underestimate because its not known for certain that all the other women didnt miscarry.", "We dont know what happened to them.", "We only know what happened to the 827.", "Thats why they decided to use the 827, because there were definite outcomes, she said, adding that the research team would be publishing a new report with longer follow-up soon.", "In an email to the fact-checking site Lead Stories, Sharan explained that the agency struggled with how to best report the data, given that so many participants were still pregnant or had not yet reported an outcome to the registry.", "We felt it was important to report all spontaneous abortions that had been observed in the registry thus far.", "At the same time, we also wanted to limit the analysis to pregnancies for which [we] had final outcome data as there may be completed pregnancies we are not yet aware of because they have not had a scheduled follow-up call, she said.", "In a future report in which more follow-up time has passed, we plan to limit the assessment of spontaneous abortions to completed pregnancies vaccinated at less than 20 weeks and whose estimated date of delivery has passed, Sharan added.", "Because of where we were in the vaccination efforts at the time of data analysis, that method provided both a numerator and denominator of zero.", "We therefore chose to report spontaneous abortions among all completed pregnancies in this preliminary report.", "In her Twitter thread, Male said that both the CDC method and the way

of a miscarriage, which is relatively common, especially in early pregnancy.", "[A]s more patients deliver, the true denominator will become apparent, Feinberg said.", "The data will speak for itself, vaccination is safe in pregnant patients.", "Update, Aug. 16: The CDC issued a statement on Aug. 11 recommending that pregnant people be vaccinated, based on a new analysis of v-safe pregnancy registry data that included nearly 2,500 pregnant people who received at least one dose of an mRNA vaccine before 20 weeks of gestation.", "That study, not yet peer-reviewed or published, found no increased risk of miscarriage with vaccination.", "It calculated the cumulative risk of a spontaneous abortion between six and 19 weeks  otherwise known as a miscarriage  to be 12.8% when adjusted for age, which is within the expected range.", "The increased circulation of the highly contagious Delta variant, the low vaccine uptake among pregnant people, and the increased risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications related to COVID-19 infection among pregnant people make vaccination for this population more urgent than ever, the CDC said in its statement.", "Update, Nov. 8: The study finding a 12.8% risk has since been published as a peer-reviewed letter to the New England Journal of Medicine on Sept. 8.", "Other research also supports those findings.", "Using data on 105,446 pregnancies from eight health systems that participate with the CDC in the Vaccine Safety Datalink program, another group of researchers found that those who experienced a miscarriage did not have an increased odds of exposure to a COVID-19 vaccination in the prior 28 days compared with ongoing pregnancies.", "Those findings were published in September in a research letter to JAMA.", "As weve written before, in contrast to evidence that COVID-19 can increase pregnancy complications, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous to pregnant people.", "Even though pregnant people were excluded from the vaccine clinical trials, some individuals did become pregnant while participating  and those receiving the immunizations did not miscarry more frequently.", "Moreover, reproductive toxicity studies of the vaccines in pregnant animals revealed no safety concerns, and as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has pointed out, based on how the vaccines work, there is no reason to think they would be any less safe for pregnant people compared to those who are not.", "A report published in the journal F&S on June 2 also found no difference, based on vaccination status, in the ability of an embryo to implant or to remain viable in early pregnancy among women who were undergoing in vitro fertilization to become pregnant.", "The results further support the idea that the vaccines are safe for pregnant people and do not have harmful effects on fertility, an unsubstantiated claim we have previously addressed.", "Similarly, a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on July 12 found that immunization with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Israel was associated with protection against infection with the coronavirus among pregnant women, with no difference in the frequency of induced or spontaneous abortions or other negative birth outcomes in those who were vaccinated compared to matched unvaccinated controls.",

in this article, death after vaccination does not imply that the adverse event is indeed the actual cause of death, he said.", "Existing health problems turned out to be the most obvious explanation for the fatal outcomes in the majority of cases.", "In a limited number of reports, adverse events following immunisation, known to be associated with the COVID vaccines (e.g.", "fever, nausea or malaise), may have contributed to the worsening of an already fragile health condition or an underlying medical condition.", "Suggesting all reports with a fatal outcome to be causally related is far from truth.", "Also, Van Puijenbroek said, the papers assertion that the reported deaths were certified by medical specialists is simply incorrect.", "The lead author of the study, Harald Walach, is a psychologist and professor at Poznan University of the Medical Sciences in Poland.", "He and his co-authors penned a two-page letter defending their study, published by Retraction Watch, in which they

only have association, we agree, and we never said anything else.", "There were other issues with the paper, too.", "In addition to the fact that the deaths and other adverse events reported to the Dutch system are not confirmed to be caused by the vaccines, the authors arbitrarily chose to use that system to look at the case reports submitted per 100,000 vaccinations.", "But that systems volume is an outlier, relative to the rest of Europe.", "They have a median of 127 per 100k, ranging from 15 to 701, with Netherlands 701 being an extreme outlier, Jeffrey Morris, director of the division of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania, told us in an email.", "They give some unconvincing rationale why they think using the 701 to represent the truth is the best idea, thus strongly skewing the adverse event rate of vaccines by a factor of almost 6 relative to using the median for all of Europe.", "The paper also uses a concept known as the number needed to vaccinate, or NNTV, to estimate how many doses would need to be administered in order to avert one COVID-19 case or death.", "For deaths, it concludes that the NNTV to prevent one death is between 9000 and 50,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate.", "But using that kind of measure  also referred to as the number needed to treat, or NNT  is problematic for several reasons, Morris said, especially for something where the risk is spread over a long period of time.", "The key factor here is that NNT depends directly on the time frame, and when you compute it using data from a short term study, it severely [underestimates] the benefit when the risk is spread over a longer time frame, he said.", "The authors used data from an Israeli study that followed up with participants who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for an average of 15 days.", "Morris said the short time frame for computing vaccine benefit is especially misleading since the reported adverse events (which again, arent confirmed to be due to the vaccine) are typically occurring within that short time frame  but only a small fraction of the beneficial effects of the vaccine, preventing cases for the next year or two or longer, are captured.", "Also, the measure is influenced by other factors  such as lockdowns, social distancing and masking.", "And when many people are vaccinated, the probability of infection and death goes down  therefore making the number needed to vaccinate higher (and the vaccine benefit appear smaller).", "In short, the NNT is an extremely flawed measure even if they had good data for estimating the risk of infection, hospitalization and death for vaccinated and unvaccinated groups and interpreted the data properly (which of course they did not), Morris said."],

genome is copied again and again.", "A mutation is one change to the genetic sequence of a virus, while a variant is a distinct virus, typically with several mutations.", "Most mutations dont change the viruss biology, clinical outcomes or how the bodys immune systems responds.", "But sometimes mutations can result in a competitive advantage for the virus, in its ability to replicate or transmit, for instance, or in how effectively immunity from a previous infection or a vaccine is able to fight the virus.", "Dr. Adam Lauring, an associate professor in the department of microbiology & immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School, studies viral evolution.", "Viruses are like people playing slot machines, he explained to us.", "Most of the time they lose when theyre making mutations.", "But with the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, you have a lot of people playing the slot machines, so the chances of someone hitting the jackpot and coming up with a new variant that has a competitive advantage are much higher.", "Lauring said we need to have fewer people playing the slots  that is, fewer people getting infected and spreading the virus.", "The good news is that, so far, the authorized vaccines have been largely effective against the variants that have most concerned scientists.", "So far, studies suggest that antibodies generated through vaccination with currently authorized vaccines recognize these variants, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about five variants of concern within the United States.", "This is being closely investigated and more studies are underway.", "The CDC is using three classifications for variants.", "A variant of interest is the lowest level and pertains to a variant that is associated with or predicted to affect transmission, effectiveness of antibodies, treatments or tests.", "There are eight such variants that the CDC is monitoring.", "A variant of concern, the next level up, is one for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease (e.g.,  increased hospitalizations or deaths), significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures, the CDC explains.", "There are five of those: B.1.1.7, which first emerged in the United Kingdom; B.1.351, initially identified in South Africa; P.1, first identified in Brazil; and B.1.427 and B.1.429, two variants identified in California in February.", "There are no variants in the CDCs top classification level: a variant of high consequence.", "To reach that level, there would need to be clear evidence that prevention measures or medical countermeasures (MCMs) have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating variants.", "While the authorized COVID-19 vaccines (from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson in the United States), were designed to protect against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, whose genetic sequence was published in January, thats not the virus the vaccines ultimately have confronted.", "Still, they worked extremely well.", "Clinical trials showed the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had at least 94% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, authorized more than two months later, had a 72% efficacy in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 in the U.S. We were on version three or four of the virus by the time the vaccines were rolled out, Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H.", "Chan School of Public Health, said during an April 20 interview broadcast on Facebook Live.", "We have pretty good evidence now to suggest that quite a number of them are more transmissible, he said of the variants, which puts pressure on getting vaccines out quickly.", "And while the effectiveness of the vaccines isnt as strong for some variants that are circulating right now, Mina said, it doesnt seem hugely destructive.", "Its not like these variants are able to completely break through peoples immune systems.", "Studies have found the vaccines work very well against the B.1.1.7 variant, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the Food and Drug Administrations Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, told us.", "More worrisome, he said, are the other variants of concern, but even then, the vaccines, as well as natural immunity, protect against severe, critical disease, and mild, moderate disease, but not as well.", "That line hasnt been crossed, Offit said of protection against severe disease.", "To date, Offit said, we are not seeing a variant that evades the vaccines.", "But in some corners of social media, predictions of a mass destruction scenario are circulating, painting widespread vaccination as the culprit for variants that wont be able to be controlled by vaccines.", "In an article on these claims, Jonathan Jarry, a science communicator for McGill Universitys Office for Science and Society, writes: [I]f we are concerned about the virus mutating to evade vaccine protection, the solution is to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible and to eventually reformulate the vaccines to match variants of concern that acquire this ability.", "Were not facing eminent catastrophe, Andrew Read, an evolutionary microbiologist and director of Pennsylvania State Universitys Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, told us when we asked him about such claims.", "When vaccinated people are hospitalized, scientists can examine the virus, and if a variant is emerging that cant be combated with the current vaccines, they can be tweaked.", "It happens with seasonal flu all the time, Read said.", "Monitoring the emergence of variants is very important, he said, but no reason for panic.", "Two types of studies have estimated the effectiveness of the authorized vaccines against the variants of concern: observational studies that look at infections and severity of disease in the real world as the vaccines have been administered, and lab studies that use blood samples from vaccinated people and those who have recovered from COVID-19 to measure how well their antibodies neutralize variants.", "Several studies have suggested COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against the B.1.1.7 variant, which first emerged in the U.K. in September and was identified in the U.S. in late

deaths, out of nearly 8 million vaccine doses of the J&J vaccine, as of April 21.", "The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration recommended resuming use of the shot with a warning of the rare, increased risk, explaining that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks, and that the risk hasnt been seen with the other authorized vaccines.", "The obvious benefit of all these vaccines is that they reduce the rates of hospitalization and death from COVID-19.", "A recent government analysis in the U.K. estimated that vaccines there had prevented 10,400 deaths for those over 60 years old

those ailments."], "paragraphs": ["Update, Aug. 27, 2021: The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, received full approval from the agency on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older.", "Update, Feb. 10, 2022: The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine received full approval from the FDA on Jan. 31 for individuals 18 years

hospitalized or receiving oxygen, have also been approved or authorized by federal agencies, and they continue to be studied.", "Since the pandemic began, however, politicized social media posts have featured doctors, some looking authoritative in white coats, spreading dubious claims about both vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.", "The most recent example in this misinformation niche is Dr. Ryan Cole, who owns a medical lab in Idaho.", "Cole is featured in a video that has amassed more than a million views.", "He makes a variety of claims, some of which weve addressed before.", "The video was recorded while he spoke at a forum on March 4 hosted by Idahos lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin, a Republican, and it was posted by a Libertarian organization called the Idaho Freedom Foundation.", "McGeachin was featured in an October post by that group, posing with a Bible and a gun in a video that advocated against public health measures related to the pandemic and asked viewers to sign a statement saying that any order issued in the future will be ignored.", "Cole said in an interview with FactCheck.org that hes not affiliated with any political party, group or organization.", "According to the Idaho Secretary of States office, Cole is registered as a Republican.", "In the March 4 video, Cole makes claims suggesting that federal agencies have acted nefariously, as well as claims that undermine vaccines and promise miracle treatments.", "Well address his four main claims.", "Two of the COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to train recipients immune systems to make antibodies that fight the virus that causes COVID-19.", "(See SciChecks articles on those vaccines: A Guide to Modernas COVID-19 Vaccine and A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTechs COVID-19 Vaccine.)", "These are the first vaccines using mRNA technology authorized in the U.S., but scientists have been developing and testing mRNA vaccines for years, including in people during clinical trials.", "Still, misinformation exploiting fears of this new technology has been common online.", "To those bogus claims, Cole has now added: mRNA trials in mammals have led to odd cancers.", "mRNA trials on mammals have led to autoimmune diseases  not right away, six, nine, 12 months later.", "We asked Cole to provide support for those claims, and he referred us to a 2018 paper published in the journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery that reviewed trials and studies of various, earlier mRNA vaccines.", "But that paper doesnt support his statement.", "Norbert Pardi, a research assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, was the lead author of the paper.", "He told us in an email, No publications demonstrate that mRNA vaccines cause cancer or autoimmune diseases.", "Pardis 19-page paper does make one passing reference to autoimmune diseases, which is what Cole highlighted to us.", "The paper says: A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity.", "Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken.", "But, Pardi explained, he and the other researchers included that passage because they wanted to note some potential concerns.", "However, he emphasized that no scientific evidence has confirmed that these concerns are real.", "Its also worth noting that the paper predated the COVID-19 pandemic by two years, so it doesnt include any information specifically about the COVID-19 vaccines.", "Simply put, there is no scientific evidence that shows that mRNA vaccines cause autoimmune diseases, Pardi said.", "Multiple clinical trials have been performed with mRNA vaccines in the past 10 years and none of them found that mRNA vaccination caused autoimmune diseases.", "Further, we are not aware of any studies showing an autoimmune disease appearing many months after vaccination as Dr. Cole inaccurately suggests.", "Likewise, Dr. Roger Shapiro, associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvards T.H.", "Chan School of Public Health, told us in an email that he was unaware of any study that would support Coles claim that the vaccines are carcinogenic.", "There is nothing in the science of mRNA vaccines that would suggest carcinogenicity, and they have been tested in humans for other diseases before COVID-19, Shapiro said.", "mRNA rapidly breaks down in the body, and probably does not last long enough to act as a carcinogen.", "Regarding autoimmunity, he said, this is always a concern with any medical product, but there is no evidence to date suggesting it, and it does not seem any more likely than with other vaccines.", "mRNA is made all the time in our bodies, and delivering it by vaccine should not be different.", "Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care, concurred with the other experts with whom we spoke.", "In a phone interview, he characterized Coles claims about cancer as fearmongering and said, Theres just no scientific basis for that.", "Were talking about these very small fragments of messenger RNA that dont hang around for long at all, he said, noting that the mRNA vaccines have been in use for almost six months and have been very safe, very well-tolerated vaccines.", "Winslow recognized that some people are concerned that the mRNA from the vaccine might persist in their bodies and somehow change their genetics or cause long-term effects.", "So he emphasized that the vaccines have small fragments of RNA, which survive only briefly and carry information about the virus that causes COVID-19.", "Similarly, Pardi told us, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines do not alter our DNA and they get rapidly degraded so they do not promote cancer formation.", "Cole also suggested in the video that the federal government had suppressed a treatment for COVID-19 in order to vend a vaccine.", "(Well address his claims about the supposed treatment in the next section.)", "If theres a treatment for a disease, the federal government cannot approve a vaccine by law, by rule, Cole falsely claimed, suggesting that federal agencies were withholding access to a treatment for COVID-19 so that they could instead profit from vaccines.", "So, the NIH, who, you know, is involved in approving medications, they co-hold the patent on the vaccine with Moderna, Cole said, referring to the National Institutes of Health, an agency that does not approve medications.", "If the fox is not guarding the henhouse there, I dont know who is.", "That also is insanity to have the government in bed with a private company vending a product that they want to give to everybody.", "There are several problems with this statement.", "First, there is no law barring vaccines if treatments are available for a given disease, said Jorge Contreras, a professor in the College of Law at the University of Utah who specializes in intellectual property and genetics and the law.", "He asked, Why would there be such a law?", "Clearly there isnt, Contreras pointed out, since the Food and Drug Administration authorizes a flu vaccine every year while Tamiflu, an antiviral drug used to treat the flu, has been available since the FDA approved it in 1999.", "Its certainly true that many diseases that we vaccinate for, there is no known cure for, he said, noting that this is often the case with viral diseases, which are hard to treat.", "But thats not a legal requirement.", "Thats a scientific reality, he said.", "As for Coles claim about the NIH, that agency conducts and funds research.", "It doesnt approve drugs, medical devices or vaccines  thats a function of the FDA.", "The NIH did collaborate with Moderna on the development of its COVID-19 vaccine.", "As weve explained, government researchers had previously been working with scientists at Moderna on an investigational vaccine to protect against MERS, another disease caused by a coronavirus.", "The team was able to apply that knowledge to design a COVID-19 vaccine.", "Since the NIH does research, it also files and receives patents, many of which it licenses to pharmaceutical companies.", "So, Contreras said, NIHs patents stemming from research on mRNA vaccines are to be expected, and use of those patents by pharmaceutical companies is also to be expected.", "Similarly, scientists from government-funded labs sometimes share credit on patents with scientists from privately funded labs.", "Thats normal, too, Contreras said.", "Generally, he explained, there are two reasons that the NIH licenses its patents to companies.", "First, the NIH is a taxpayer-funded institution, and it can recoup some of its investment in research by lending out the use of its discoveries.", "Second, the clinical trials required to bring a drug or vaccine to market are risky and expensive, so, theoretically, making its discoveries available to companies can encourage the private sector to take the risk and create products.", "So, Cole mischaracterizes the relationship between the NIH and the vaccine manufacturers when he says that its a conflict of interest to have the federal government in bed with a vaccine company.", "Its actually normal to have pharmaceutical companies use government-owned patents.", "And hes wrong when he says of federal agencies, they dont want a therapy to work because then they can vend their vaccine.", "Theres nothing that would prohibit the use of vaccines if there were an effective treatment for COVID-19.", "Neither the World Health Organization nor the National Institutes of Health has recommended the use of ivermectin  a common anti-parasitic medication  in the treatment of COVID-19.", "Merck, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures ivermectin, has similarly noted that there is [n]o scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies; No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and; A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.", "But Cole claimed in the video that ivermectin is a treatment for COVID-19.", "He suggested that federal agencies have stifled its use so that they could profit from vaccines, as we explained above.", "Were in farm country, horse country  you know, you give it to your dogs, your cats, your horses, Cole said in the video, addressing an audience in Idaho.", "Ivermectin is used to treat parasites in animals, but crossover use in humans can be dangerous.", "While Cole may have only been emphasizing the ubiquity of the drug, not suggesting that people should take veterinary medicine, the FDA has said that patients have been hospitalized after taking ivermectin intended for horses as interest in the drug as treatment for COVID-19 has grown.", "Ivermectin does have antiviral properties, but the FDA hasnt approved it to treat any viral infections.", "It is being studied with regard to COVID-19, though, according to both the WHO and NIH.", "Treating COVID-19 with Ivermectin is still being evaluated in clinical trials, but at present there is not enough evidence to support its use, said Shapiro, the Harvard professor.", "My understanding is that the inhibitory dose needed for it to work is extremely high and trying to take enough to suppress the virus could lead to other problems.", "The trials so far have showed no benefit or worsening disease, some showed shorter time to disease resolution or viral clearance, and some did show a possible mortality benefit; but there were problems with most of these trials that include small sample size and different outcome measures and other possible biases, he said.", "Winslow, from Stanford, cautioned that there have been many claims for miracle cures over the course of the pandemic and said that ivermectin would need more rigorous study before we know how useful it would be in treating COVID-19.", "Ivermectin truly is a wonder drug for parasitic diseases, he said, but my suspicion is that it will be a lot like hydroxychloroquine.", "Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that was touted by former President Donald Trump as a treatment for COVID-19, although studies found that it wasnt an effective treatment and may cause serious side effects in some patients, as weve explained before.", "The problem with drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which are promoted as having broad-spectrum antiviral properties, is that the quantity of inhibitor required to effectively kill off the virus also sickens the host cells, Winslow said.", "Even potent versions, like remdesivir, which Winslow referred to as the gold standard of specific antiviral therapy in COVID-19 treatments, only accelerates the time to recovery, but doesnt significantly reduce death rates or mortality from COVID-19.", "Remdesivir is the only drug approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19; the approval is for patients requiring hospitalization.", "So, Coles claim that there is blood on the hands of bureaucrats in Washington who have suppressed this life-saving medication, is unfounded.", "Ivermectin hasnt been proved to be effective.", "Another of the major points that Cole emphasized in the video is the role vitamin D could have in fighting COVID-19.", "If you do not supplement with vitamin D in the wintertime, you are immune suppressed.", "Most insurance companies in Idaho and northern states do not pay for a vitamin D test, unfortunately, said Cole, whose lab offers several vitamin D tests.", "After eschewing public health guidelines that recommend staying six feet apart and wearing masks to slow the spread of the virus, Cole said, What should public health message number one, two, and three be?", "Vitamin D, vitamin D, vitamin D. Its true that vitamin D, which is mostly associated with bone health, plays a part in the immune system.", "But that doesnt mean its a panacea for COVID-19, as weve explained before.", "While a lot of basic research points to vitamin D having a role in the immune system, it is less clear if these mechanisms are applicable in clinical practice and to what degree they would benefit COVID-19 patients, as weve written.", "Studies assessing whether vitamin D can treat or prevent infectious diseases have generally been inconsistent.", "A recent article from NPR looked at the research on vitamin D with respect to COVID-19 over the last year and found, essentially, the same thing.", "It also noted that some studies have shown that low vitamin D levels are associated with a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or with becoming seriously ill.", "While these studies raised hopes among some researchers, others are skeptical, noting that most of these are observational studies, not the gold-standard randomized, controlled trials, the story said.", "Much of the available evidence only shows association  not causation  and even those results are mixed, Walter Willett, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H.", "Chan School of Public Health, told NPR.", "In September, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an Instagram Live interview that for those who are deficient in vitamin D, I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements.", "But, as we wrote before, excessive doses should not be used.", "Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.", "Coronavirus Resource Center.", "Accessed 16 Apr 2021.", "Harvard Health Publishing.", "Treatments for COVID-19.", "Harvard Medical School.", "Updated 5 Apr 2021.", "Fichera, Angelo.", "FactCheck.org.", "Texas Doctor Spreads False Claims About COVID-19 Vaccines.", "26 Mar 2021.", "Hale Spencer, Saranac.", "FactCheck.org.", "Video Uses Bogus Claims to Stoke Race-Based Fears of COVID-19 Vaccine.", "2 Feb 2021.", "Idaho Secretary of States Office.", "Email to FactCheck.org.", "9 Apr 2021.", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "Understanding mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines.", "CDC.gov.", "Updated 4 Mar 2021.", "McDonald, Jessica.", "FactCheck.org.", "A Guide to Modernas COVID-19 Vaccine.", "Updated 9 Apr 2021.", "McDonald, Jessica.", "FactCheck.org.", "A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTechs COVID-19 Vaccine.", "Updated 9 Apr 2021.", "Jaramillo, Catalina.", "FactCheck.org.", "No Evidence Vaccines Impact Fertility.", "Updated 3 Mar 2021.", "Pardi, Norbert, et al.", "mRNA vaccines  a new era in vaccinology.", "Nature Reviews.", "12 Jan 2018.", "Pardi, Norbert.", "Research assistant professor of medicine, University of Pennsylvania.", "Email exchange with FactCheck.org.", "12 Apr 2021.", "Shapiro, Roger.", "Associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases, T.H.", "Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University.", "Emailed responses to FactCheck.org.", "8 Apr 2021.", "Winslow, Dean.", "Infectious disease physician, Stanford Health Care.", "Telephone interview with FactCheck.org.", "12 Apr 2021.", "Contreras, Jorge.", "Professor, college of law, University of Utah.", "Telephone interview with FactCheck.org.", "15 Apr 2021.", "U.S. Food & Drug Administration.", "FDAs Critical Role in Ensuring Supply of Influenza Vaccine.", "FDA.gov.", "28 Sep 2020.", "U.S. Food & Drug Administration.", "Tamiflu: Consumer Questions and Answers.", "FDA.gov.", "14 Nov 2017.", "U.S. Food & Drug Administration.", "Drug Approval Package  Tamiflu.", "FDA.gov.", "Approval date 27 Oct 1999.", "National Institutes of Health.", "About the NIH.", "NIH.gov.", "7 Jul 2015.", "National Institutes of Health.", "How are drugs approved for use in the United States?", "NIH.gov.", "1 Dec 2016.", "World Health Organization.", "WHO advises that ivermectin only be used to treat COVID-19 within clinical trials.", "WHO.int.", "31 Mar 2021.", "National Institutes of Health.", "COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines  ivermectin.", "NIH.gov.", "11 Feb 2021.", "Merck & Co.

if you are fully vaccinated.", "In real-world conditions, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released in March found the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were 90% effective in preventing infections  not just symptomatic cases., Johnson & Johnsons phase 3 trial reported an efficacy of 72% in preventing moderate to severe disease in the U.S. and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease., The CDC, however, recommends that for now fully vaccinated people should wear masks in public for several reasons, including a stubbornly high rate of infection, concern about variants and the need for more research on whether asymptomatic vaccinated people can make unvaccinated people sick., Notwithstanding the data, Fox News host Tucker Carlson baselessly casts doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccines by claiming people in charge are acting like it doesnt work, citing the fact that President Joe Biden wears a mask even though he has been vaccinated.,

Infectious Diseases, has answered this most basic of all questions., As we have written, it is important not to confuse the virus, SARS-CoV-2, with the disease that it causes, COVID-19.", "The vaccines protect against COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the coronavirus.", "It may not, however, protect against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the vaccinated person may not experiencesymptoms., Fauci explained this in a Dec. 10 interview with CNNs Chris Cuomo before the arrival in the U.S. of the first case a SARS-CoV-2 variant.", "He did so again more recently at a White House briefing on April 12 and at a House oversight committee hearing on April 15., At the hearing, Fauci said vaccinated people are not expected to show any symptoms and science needs to conduct more research on whether asymptomatic vaccinated people can make other unvaccinated people sick., Fauci said there is another issue to be concerned about and that is the circulation of coronavirus variants  the first of which was discovered in the U.S. on Jan. 25 in a traveler returning to Minnesota from Brazil., We want to make sure that if you have full protection against one type of a virus that a variant might come along that might escape the protection.", "So if you want full protection and you are out in the community where theres a lot of virus out there, thats why we still recommend wearing a mask, he said.", "And in answer to question before, when you get the level of virus really low, all of that is going to go away and you are not going to have anyvery, very little risk therefore people will not have to wear a mask., This is why both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris wear masks even though theyve been vaccinated., As Biden explained in a Dec. 3 interview with CNNs Jake Tapper, theyre setting an example for the public.", "It is important that we, in fact, the president and the vice president, we set the pattern by wearing masks, Biden said., Also before he took office, Biden announced his plan for a 100-day challenge aimed at slowing the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.", "It included an appeal for all Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his administration as well as administering 100 million shots in the same timeframe., Two weeks ahead of that deadline, more than 200 million vaccines have been administered in the U.S., about 190 million of which were given since Biden took office., As for the call to wear masks, the first executive order that Biden signed required those on federal property to wear masks.", "On his second day in office, Biden signed an executive order requiring masks on public transportation., Were still in Bidens first 100 days, which ends on April 30., In guidance issued on April 2, the CDC said fully vaccinated people can meet indoors without masks or social distancing with other fully vaccinated people and can have such visits with unvaccinated people who are at low-risk of contracting severe COVID-19 (if the unvaccinated people are from a single household).", "But the fully vaccinated should wear masks and remain physically distanced from when visiting unvaccinated people from more than one household or in public settings., When you are in the home  you are vaccinated people  or you have a child, and a grandmother, grandfather, whoever it is  as long as theyre in good shape, you dont have to wear a mask, Fauci said at the April 12 White House briefing.", "But once you go out into that big bad world out there, where there are a lot of infections going on  80,000 new infections in one day  that there is an issue there that youve got to be careful with., At the hearing, Fauci directly responded to Carlsons false implication that vaccines dont work.", "The implication was since youre asking us to wear masks, the vaccine might not be working, he said.", "My comment to that is that the vaccines were shown, the mRNA vaccines, to be between 94 and 95 percent effective.", "So my answer to him is merely one of data.", "Look at the data.", "The vaccines are highly efficacious and have been shown in the field to be highly effective., Editors note:

Hopkins.", "Schuchat said the risk of CVST is very low for those who got the shot more than a month ago.", "While the cases have been rare, Schuchat said: For people who recently got the vaccine within the last couple of weeks, they should be aware to look for any symptoms.", "If youve received the vaccine and develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath, you should contact your health care provider and seek medical treatment.", "Marks noted that flu-like symptoms were a common side effect in the first few days after vaccination.", "So I think for the internist out there and the primary care providers who are caring for patients, if theyre seeing flu-like symptoms and headache for the first few days after a vaccination, that is likely just what has been seen in the common adverse events that are not serious with these vaccines.", "Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean at the Emory School of Medicine & Grady Health System, told CNN the benefits of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine far outweigh the risk for those older than 50 and 18 to 20 years old.", "I want to emphasize the benefit of vaccination far outweigh right now, you know, the

you were to get COVID, the possibility of you dying from COVID at that age is about 55 in a million.", "CVST occurs annually in 2 to 14 people out of 1 million in the general population, Marks said at the press conference.", "The concern, however, is that the six cases of CVST  which represent less than 1 in a million of those vaccinated with the J&J vaccine  also had low levels of blood platelets.", "The real thing that is so notable here is not just the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or the thrombocytopenia.", "Those two things can occur, he said.", "Its their occurrence together that makes a pattern.", "And that pattern is very, very similar to what was seen in Europe with another vaccine.", "So I think we have to take the time to make sure we understand this complication, and we address it properly.", "Marks was referring to Europes experience with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine  which, like the J&J vaccine, is also an adenovirus-based vaccine.", "AstraZeneca is not authorized for use in the United States.", "Similar to the cases reported in the U.S. with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the majority of the cases reported in Europe have occurred in women 60 years old or younger, within two weeks of receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine, according to European Medicines Agencys safety committee.", "The EMA issued a statement on April 7 saying that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, also known as Vaxzevria vaccine.", "As of March 22, EMAs Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee had reviewed 62 reported cases of blood clots in the brain and 24 reported cases of blood clots in the abdomen, or splanchnic vein thrombosis, in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, where 25 million people had received the vaccine.", "Eighteen of the cases were fatal.", "The committee stated that one possible explanation for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in patients treated with heparin (heparin induced thrombocytopenia, HIT), a common and potent blood thinner.", "Similarly, Marks said at the CDC and FDA press conference that while there is no definitive cause for the adverse reaction in the six U.S. cases the probable cause may be an immune response that occurs very, very rarely after some people receive the vaccine, and that immune response leads to activation of the platelets, and these extremely rare blood clots.", "According to an April 11 news report in Science, at least 222 suspected cases have been reported in Europe after 34 million individuals have received their first dose of the vaccine, and more than 30 have died.", "A team of scientists led by clotting expert Andreas Greinacher of the University of Greifswald has been studying 11 cases of what hes calling vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia in Germany and Austria.", "A second team is looking at five cases in Norway.", "Both likened the condition to what doctors see in patients treated with heparin, according to a news report by STAT.", "The EMA concluded that given the associated risks of COVID-19 and the fact that the reported combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is very rare, the overall benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects.", "But according to Science, many countries are restricting the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for younger people who have less risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19.", "Germany is using the vaccine only in people 60 years old or older, France in those 55 years old or older, and the United Kingdom is recommending that those younger than 30 years old get another vaccine.", "On April 12, Johnson & Johnson began delivering doses of its COVID-19 vaccine to countries in Europe.", "But a day later, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement that it was reviewing the U.S. cases with health authorities in Europe and had made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.", "We have been working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public, the statement said.", "The FDA issued Janssen Biotech Inc., a Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical company, an emergency use authorization for the vaccine on Feb. 27.", "On CNN, Offit was asked why this adverse reaction involving blood clots did not show up in the J&J clinical trials.", "Because it was too rare, Offit said.", "If you look at the way the J&J did their trial, that was roughly a 44,000-person trial, 18,000 U.S.", "If an event is occurring in one in a million people, youre unlikely to see that.", "But again, I just want to make the point that it should be reassuring to people that were always looking, always looking to make sure that there isnt even a very, very rare side effect, and that should be reassuring to people.", "As we have reported, there were 44,325 participants in J&Js phase 3 trial  21,895 received the COVID-19 vaccine and 21,888 were in the placebo group.", "The FDA determined three non-fatal serious adverse events in the vaccinated group were likely related to the vaccine: a hypersensitivity reaction involving urticaria or hives, injection site pain unresponsive to over-the-counter pain medicine, and a case involving a few days of symptoms including generalized malaise, weakness, myalgia, shortness of breath, headache, sensation of numbness and tingling in upper extremities, chest pain and fever.", "The safety analysis supported a favorable safety profile with no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA, the FDA briefing document said.", "There was one reported case of a 25-year-old male during the trial who experienced a transverse sinus thrombosis 21 days after receiving the J&J vaccine.", "The event caused a pause in the study trial, but ultimately was ruled unrelated to the vaccine.", "After thorough investigation and expert consultation no clear cause of the event was identified; however possible contributing factors, such as preceding infection and an anatomical anomaly, were suggested, the FDA briefing document said.", "The investigators brochure and informed consent form were updated accordingly, and the study pause was lifted.", "The investigator and Sponsors final assessment of this event was that it was not related to the study product.", "The CDC and FDA did not order a halt to administering the J&J vaccine, and the pause is not expected to last long, as we noted earlier.", "This is a recommendation and its not a mandate, Marks said.", "Its out of an abundance of caution.", "Were recommending that the vaccine be paused in terms of its administration.", "However, if an individual health care provider has a conversation with an individual patient and they determined that the benefit-risk for that individual patient is appropriate, were not going to stop that provider from administering the vaccine,

similar death reporting guidance for other issues, such as for fatalities due to drug toxicity and relating to disaster events.)", "In short, the papers authors argue that the March 24 notice was subject to the Information Quality Act and Paperwork Reduction Act  and therefore should have been publicized in the Federal Register and subject to public comment.", "But theres no support for that

the fatality data being presented by the CDC is illegally inflated, then all public health policies based upon them would be immediately null and void, the authors wrote.", "But the paper misconstrues

most important diagnosis  the underlying cause of death  that is to be listed on the lowest line of Part I, Gill said.", "The condition immediately preceding death (such as pneumonia) would be listed first and then the illness that caused that condition (COVID-19, for example) would be listed below it.", "Similarly, Anderson, the chief of the CDCs mortality statistics branch, said the authors of the October paper do not seem to understand how death certificates are designed or how the cause of death should be certified.", "A comparison of the 2003 guidelines and the COVID-19 guidance doesnt reveal any significant change in procedure.", "Part I is for reporting a chain of events leading directly to death, with the immediate cause of death (the final disease, injury, or complication directly causing death) on line (a) and the underlying cause of death (the disease or injury that initiated the chain of events that led directly and inevitably to death) on the lowest used line, the 2003 guidelines say.", "Part II is for reporting all other significant diseases, conditions, or injuries that contributed to death but which did not result in the underlying cause of death given in Part I.", "And heres how the CDC explained the completion of death certificates in its April 2020 guidance specific to COVID-19, beginning with Part I: So its not accurate to claim that the CDCs COVID-19 guidance represented a significant departure from the 2003 guidelines, as the paper repeatedly says.", "Its unclear why the authors conclude that, under the 2003 guidelines, COVID-19 would have been more correctly included in Part II as an infection that contributed to death.", "The authors also say that the inclusion of probable fatalities is indicative that the data presented is inaccurate.", "But the 2003 document, in fact, notes that the cause of death is to be determined according to the best medical opinion  and clearly states: A condition can be listed as probable even if it has not been definitively diagnosed.", "And contrary to Bells insinuation that fatalities are being deliberately inflated by deaths unrelated to the disease  such as the tree that they ran into that killed them from blunt force trauma or whatever  the CDC explicitly advises that COVID-19 not be reported in such cases where the disease didnt factor into the death.", "The CDC emphasizes: COVID-19 should not be reported on the death certificate if it did not cause or contribute to the death.", "Finally, the paper makes no mention of excess deaths.", "As weve previously explained, excess deaths are deaths above the number expected in a given time period.", "In the context of COVID-19, it can help assess the true impact of the pandemic by capturing direct and indirect effects of the virus.", "It can account for unreported COVID-19 deaths and for other factors, such as people dying from other causes (say, avoiding medical attention), as well as drops in other deaths due to pandemic-related restrictions.", "A New York Times analysis of CDC mortality data shows that, from March 2020 to February 2021, deaths nationwide were about 21% higher than what would have been

the spread of the disease.", "It does not meet the CDCs own definition of a vaccine.", "Thats why its a deceptive trade practice under 15 US Code Section 41 of the Federal Trade Commission for pharmaceutical companies who are producing this experimental gene therapy to claim that its a vaccine.", "The vaccines have demonstrated in clinical trials to be highly effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease, as weve detailed.", "The Pfizer and Moderna trials enrolled more than 30,000 people each and found an efficacy in preventing symptomatic disease of at least 94% after the second dose.", "So his claim that the vaccines dont provide any individual who receives the vaccine with immunity to COVID-19 is wrong.", "As weve explained before, its currently unclear how much the vaccines will limit transmission of the virus, SARS-CoV-2.", "In other words, while the vaccines were shown to prevent someone from developing symptoms of COVID-19, they may not prevent a person from carrying the virus.", "But theres a good chance they will help curb transmission to some degree: Experts say with other vaccines, a vaccinated person, even if infected with the virus, often sheds less virus, therefore making them less contagious.", "Hotzes remark that mRNA vaccines dont meet the CDCs own definition of a vaccine also holds no weight.", "He points out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website defines a vaccine as a product that stimulates a persons immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease.", "Thats correct.", "But that definition is also consistent with the FDAs decision to issue emergency use authorizations for the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines because of their demonstrated efficacy in trials.", "Clearly, Moderna and Pfizers vaccines are product[s] that stimulate a persons immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, i.e., COVID-19, and they have a protective effect,

clear what the legal effects of the CDCs website definition are, since [i]ts not a formal administrative rule or even a guidance  its just a generic definition of a vaccine.", "Hotzes argument that the mRNA vaccines are a deceptive trade practice also doesnt make sense.", "While he cites 15 US Code Section 41 of the Federal Trade Commission, it appears hes referring to 15 U.S. Code  45  since section 41 just deals with the establishment of the FTC.", "The only thing  45 of the FTC Act does, here, is give FTC authority to police deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,' Sherkow said.", "It doesnt define what a deceptive act is.", "Sherkow said the definition of a deceptive practice rests on many years worth of case law: In general, those arise when three conditions are met: there is a representation or omission that misleads a consumer; the consumers interpretation is reasonable; and the misrepresentation is material, i.e., the consumer purchased the product because of the representation.", "None of those are present here, he added.", "There is no misrepresentation about the nature of these vaccines  indeed, theres an ocean of information about exactly what they are and how they work.", "Again referencing the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, Hotze falsely claims: These so-called vaccines, which are manufactured using cells derived from human babies that were aborted in the 1970s, should more accurately be called experimental gene therapy.", "They are untested, unproven experimental gene therapy that poses a much greater danger and risk to your health than the COVID-19.", "Well first address his false assertion that the vaccines are an experimental gene therapy  an allegation he makes repeatedly throughout his video.", "The FDAs website defines gene therapy as a technique that modifies a persons genes to treat or cure disease.", "Sherkow, who has written about gene therapy, said the mRNA vaccines dont qualify as such.", "The mRNA vaccines do not modify a persons genes, i.e., their genome, he said.", "Theyre transcripts of the viruss Spike gene that get translated into protein and expressed in cells; the mRNA degrades afterwards.", "The genome remains unchanged.", "Likewise, the co-directors of the Texas Childrens Hospital Center for Vaccine Development recently explained why the gene therapy claims are inaccurate, in a piece addressing vaccine myths for the Washington Post.", "[T]he mRNA delivered through lipid nanoparticles in a vaccine does not enter our genome.", "It becomes a template for cells to make compounds of amino acids on molecules called ribosomes in the cytoplasm compartment of the cell, outside the nucleus (where the DNA resides), Dr. Peter Hotez and Maria Elena Bottazzi wrote.", "Our immune system then responds to the new peptide, which resembles the spike protein on the coronavirus.", "Therefore, its not correct to say that the mRNA vaccines are equivalent to gene therapy, as some critics of the vaccines have claimed.", "And Hotzes claim that the mRNA vaccines are manufactured using cells derived from human babies that were aborted in the 1970s is wrong, too.", "As weve explained before, fetal cells obtained from two aborted pregnancies in the early 1960s, one in Sweden and one in England, were made into cell lines that are used to grow virus to make some vaccines  such as varicella (chickenpox), rubella and hepatitis A.", "But those cells arent present in the vaccines themselves, since the virus is purified before it goes into a syringe.", "The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, however, arent made from a virus and are not manufactured using those fetal cell lines, as Hotze claims.", "That said, one of the cell lines was used to test those two mRNA vaccines to ensure they worked.", "A third vaccine approved in the U.S.  a single-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson that does not use the mRNA platform  is made by using an adenovirus that is produced using a retinal cell line that was first obtained from a fetus in 1985, according to the Vaccine Education Center at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia.", "Like other vaccines manufactured using the cell lines, fetal cells are not actually present in the J&J COVID-19 vaccine.", "Hotze distorts the facts in attempting to claim that the mRNA vaccines are dangerous.", "He claims that the vaccines will cause your immune system to be hyper-charged because its having to fight off all these viral proteins that your own body is making all the time, and it will overreact when exposed to any type of coronavirus in the future.", "He goes on to say that, in previous studies dealing with coronaviruses, the animals died from an immune system hyper reaction, when they were later exposed to the coronavirus against which they had been previously vaccinated.", "There is no evidence that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines result in such an immune response.", "Hotzes website post of the video references a commentary article from October, before any COVID-19 vaccine was authorized by the FDA, in which two researchers warned about the possibility that COVID-19 vaccine candidates could cause antibody-dependent enhancement of disease, or ADE.", "ADE is a phenomenon that occurs when a previous infection or vaccination generates antibodies that dont neutralize the virus but instead enhance the virus ability to infect cells, which can lead to a worse illness instead of preventing it.", "But the animal studies cited in the commentary piece didnt deal with mRNA vaccines, as Hotze suggests.", "One 2012 study thats referenced found that vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV (the coronavirus behind the SARS outbreak of 2003) caused mice to develop eosinophilia  a high count of a type of white blood cells  when exposed to the live virus.", "The animals didnt die, as our fact-checking colleagues at Reuters have explained.", "Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University who researches vaccines at the Center for Immunization Research, told us in an email that the issue of ADE in relation to SARS-CoV vaccine candidates dealt with inactivated vaccines  not mRNA vaccines.", "She said the specific immune response issue observed with those vaccine candidates has not been observed with any of the COVID-19 vaccines being used in the U.S. We have not seen any cases of enhanced SARS-CoV-2 disease, either in animal models or in vaccinated humans, she added.", "Other experts also have explained that there is no evidence indicating ADE is an issue with the COVID-19 vaccines.", "Derek Lowe, a medicinal chemist, explored the issue in February on his blog on the website of the journal Science Translational Medicine and explained that animal studies are specifically designed to look for signs of ADE.", "He said the research into SARS-CoV vaccines provided helpful lessons for developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.", "(A vaccine for SARS was never approved, as the outbreak ended and there are no known human cases of the disease.)", "So heres the short version: no sign of ADE during the preclinical animal studies.", "No sign during the human clinical trials.", "No sign during the initial vaccine rollouts into the population, he concluded.", "And (so far) no sign of ADE even with the variant strains in different parts of the world.", "We have things to worry about in this pandemic, but as far as I can tell today, antibody-dependent enhancement does not seem to be one of them.", "Editors note: SciChecks COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a

58-page opinion in which the judge said, [T]his case is not a close call.", "The judge found no connection between vaccines and the boys disorder.", "The paper was retracted because there were undeclared competing interests on the part of the author and there were also concerns about the validity of the methods and statistical analysis.", "Prior to publishing his paper, Hooker had spoken to

their conversations and had no control over how Hooker used the recordings.", "Thompson still works at the CDC, and when we reached him by phone, he referred us to his lawyer, Rick Morgan.", "Neither

countless lives.", "I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race.", "Vaccines prevent serious diseases, and the risks associated with their administration are vastly outweighed by their individual and societal benefits.", "So, the claim in the video uses a discredited paper to misrepresent the findings of a CDC study.", "In another distortion of scientific research, the video twists the meaning of a preliminary 2014 study that found some Somali Americans developed twice the antibody response to rubella after getting the vaccine compared with Caucasians.", "The Childrens Health Defense material, however, claims that the study, which was done by Dr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic, means that African-American children are being overdosed with todays current vaccine concentration.", "But thats not at all what the study found, Poland told us in a phone interview.", "He explained that this claim is based on a hypothesis generating study, which means that researchers look at a small sample, make observations and speculate about what those observations could mean.", "Then they do a larger study.", "In this case, Poland said, We havent done the larger study.", "In 2014, Poland and a team of researchers at the Mayo Clinic looked at 1,100 healthy children and young adults in Rochester, Minnesota, and more than 1,000 participants from the U.S.", "Naval Health Research Center in San Diego as the control group, as well as a group of recent immigrants to Rochester from Somalia.", "As we said, the Somali Americans developed twice the antibodies to rubella after getting the vaccine as their white counterparts.", "Since they havent done the larger study, researchers dont know why there is a difference or what it might mean.", "It could mean that white children are being underdosed, Poland said, explaining that without further study its unclear.", "What is clear is that the claim from the Childrens Health Defense is wrong.", "We do not have a study that shows African Americans need half the dose.", "We do not have a study that shows African American children are being overdosed, Poland said.", "He described the claim as being like a good conspiracy theory  it contains a grain of truth with a lot of speculations around it.", "The grain of truth is that researchers found higher levels of antibodies in Somali immigrants, but the rest is conjecture.", "The higher levels may not have anything to do with the vaccine, Poland said.", "For example, the study subjects could have been exposed to rubella in refugee camps before arriving in the U.S., so the antibodies from the vaccine would have added to what was already in their systems.", "So, again, this claim is a misrepresentation of a preliminary study.", "The video also revisits a controversial clinical trial from 30 years ago.", "Several years after the study concluded, the CDC acknowledged it had failed to notify parents that one of the vaccines used in the study was experimental, and of the specific risks involved.", "The Tuskegee experiment that took place from 1932 to 1972  the CDC promised us that an experiment like this would never happen again, but yet in 1989 there was a Los Angeles Times article that came out that revealed the startling truth: that the CDC admitted that they experimented on 1,500 Black and Latino boys in Los Angeles  without the parents knowing that this was an experimental test, Tony Muhammad, of the Nation of Islam, says in the video.", "Thats referring to a clinical trial for measles vaccines that the CDC conducted in Los Angeles on babies up to a year old between 1990 and 1991  amid a measles epidemic that began in 1989.", "The CDC acknowledged in a 1996 Los Angeles Times story that the families involved in the Los Angeles trial were not informed that one of the vaccines used in the trial was experimental.", "The majority of the children were African American and Latino, the newspaper reported.", "The study involved about 1,500 children, who received either high or standard doses of the Edmonston-Zagreb, or EZ, vaccine or standard doses of the Moraten vaccine, according to testimony to Congress in May 1997 by then-CDC Director Dr. David Satcher.", "The Moraten vaccine was already licensed for use in the U.S. during the trial.", "But while other countries widely used standard doses of the EZ vaccine at the time, it was new to the U.S., and the high-dose version was experimental.", "The CDC stopped the trial in October 1991 after separate studies in Senegal and Haiti suggested baby girls vaccinated with the higher potency version were at increased risk of dying in the two to three years following vaccination.", "Satcher, who was not director when the trial took place, said in his prepared remarks that the EZ vaccines that were used in the trial were approved for investigation by the Food and Drug Administration but that the consent form for families was deficient.", "He said a subsequent review by the Office for Protection from Research Risks (now the Office for Human Research Protections in the Department of Health and Human Services) determined the study was scientifically and ethically justified, but the consent form failed to identify the EZ vaccine as experimental and failed to provide an adequate description of the foreseeable risks of the experimental EZ vaccine.", "According to the Los Angeles Times, the form did not say that E-Z was experimental or unlicensed.", "But a brochure that accompanied the form said: This vaccine has been shown to be effective in younger children.", "Over 200 million children around the world have received this vaccine, but Los Angeles County is the first place in the United States where it is being offered.'", "Satcher said in a follow-up effort with families, parents were informed of the reason for the follow-up study, including the fact that some studies had found lower survival in those children who received high potency vaccine.", "The CDC didnt find any ill effects associated with the high potency EZ vaccine in its study.", "It did not identify any children who took part in the Los Angeles study and received the high potency EZ vaccine who suffered a significant health problem that can be associated with the vaccine, Satcher said.", "One child died about a year after receiving a standard-dose EZ vaccine, according to Satcher, and experts reviewed the death certificate, the circumstances surrounding the death, and the autopsy report and all agreed with the conclusion that the death was in all likelihood unrelated to the vaccine.", "Williams, of the Minority Health Institute, told us that the mistakes made were legitimate issues that shouldnt be forgotten.", "But the effort to compare that situation to the COVID-19 vaccine was a matter of apples and oranges, he said.", "Its not logical to take the results of what happened in an entirely different context and apply it to our current situation, added Williams, a past president of the National Medical Association, which is the largest and oldest association of Black physicians.", "Its worth emphasizing, as we said earlier, that the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. have successfully undergone clinical trials that demonstrated their safety.", "Williams said that he believes the issues with the measles vaccines trial werent given sufficient attention at the time.", "But, he said, that doesnt substantiate suggestions that the same thing is happening now.", "It needs to be understood, there was a mistake made, Williams said, in order to make sure those kinds of mistakes are not being made again.", "In fact, there are all sorts of preventive measures to ensure that kind of mistake doesnt occur, he added.", "Satcher outlined some changes that were made following the trial during his 1997 testimony, including institutional review changes and the creation of a checklist of elements that are to be included on consent forms.", "The video also revisits the topic of vitamin D and COVID-19.", "It presents a clip of Fauci speaking in an Instagram interview, telling the actress Jennifer Garner: If you are deficient in vitamin D that does have an impact on your susceptibility to infection  so I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements.", "Fauci was speaking (at about 31:30) about infections in general, however  not the novel coronavirus specifically, as the video may imply.", "My question is, why isnt this being discussed, or why isnt the CDC or the World Health Organization jumping on this as a potential solution to do more research around it?", "Dr. Charles Penick, a family medicine physician, asks in the video.", "Its worth noting that there are many studies under way looking into the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19.", "As weve explained before, while vitamin D might be helpful in terms of COVID-19, there isnt enough scientific evidence yet to know whether it can treat or prevent the disease.", "That said, health experts do advise getting enough vitamin D as part of a healthy lifestyle, regardless.", "Most of a persons vitamin D is made in the skin by exposure to sunlight.", "One study published in October in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, which evaluated the vitamin D levels of 216 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, found that the hospitalized patients had lower levels of vitamin D compared with a group in the general population  although it didnt identify a relationship between lower vitamin D levels and more severe disease among those patients."], "issues": ["coronavirus", "COVID-19 vaccination", "vaccines", "viral videos"], "image_data": [{"image_src": null,

claim is bogus.", "People are consenting to get the vaccine, she said.", "So even if Nuremberg was applicable here, its not non-consensual.", "And no information is being hidden.", "Its all very front and center.", "In the U.S., the FDA, for example, provides fact sheets for vaccine recipients that clearly state the findings of the clinical trials  including the potential risks and benefits  and a description of an emergency use authorization.", "An EUA is a bit different than full FDA approval, although the agency required a high level of evidence from a large, phase 3 randomized controlled trial.", "Fernandez Lynch acknowledged, as the FDA does, that not everything is known about the vaccine, but noted that no one was being forced to be vaccinated and that there was full transparency.", "We ideally would be able to watch for longer to gather more safety information about these products, but we have to make tradeoffs when were in the middle of a pandemic, she said.", "And each individual person is going to have to decide whether those tradeoffs are acceptable to them.", "As our colleagues at Reuters have written, people in the U.K. give informed consent to be vaccinated, as outlined in the countrys Green Book.", "The consent forms for the COVID-19 vaccines are available on the governments website.", "In making his argument, Coleman focuses on the fact that the COVID-19 trials are still ongoing, referring viewers to the U.S. governments clinical trial registration page for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which says the completion date for the trial is nearly two years away, on Jan. 31, 2023.", "Thats true, but misleading.", "The trial wont technically end until it follows participants for two years, but that neglects the reality that the main trial results are already available and have demonstrated the vaccines basic safety and efficacy in tens of thousands of individuals.", "Based on that phase 3 trial information, which is publicly available and has been reviewed by multiple panels of experts, the U.S. and U.K. governments concluded the benefits outweigh the potential risks and decided to authorize the vaccine for emergency use.", "People getting the vaccines now are not trial participants.", "Coleman also suggests that the U.K. governments efforts to monitor people who are vaccinated is somehow suspicious.", "They advertise for special software so that they could keep track of the high number of adverse events they were expecting  for two years, he says.", "That, too, is misleading.", "The government is not necessarily expecting adverse events, but does want to be able to detect them if they occur.", "This is standard practice after the release of a new vaccine and the U.S. has similar efforts underway.", "As weve explained before, these vaccine safety monitoring systems are important because while large phase 3 trials can show that there are no common safety concerns, rare events might only be observed once the vaccine is given to millions of people.", "A prevailing theme throughout Colemans video is the baseless idea that the available COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous to large numbers of people.", "Thousands of people whove had the vaccine have died or been seriously injured by it, he says.", "Thats an undeniable fact.", "Elderly people in care homes are dying in huge numbers.", "Were told its the infection, but its not, of course, its the damned vaccine theyre being given.", "Coleman later claims there is a horrifying avalanche of evidence showing that these damned vaccines are killing and maiming people and says, This is genocide.", "As his supposed proof, Coleman rattles off headlines from dubious websites proclaiming that people have died, without mentioning that the deaths have not been shown to be caused by the vaccine  and very likely are completely coincidental.", "For example, Coleman cites an article from Health Impact News, a website known for spreading misinformation about vaccines, that misleadingly claims 181 Dead in the U.S. During 2 Week Period From Experimental COVID Injections.", "The number comes from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which as weve written before, does not imply that the vaccine was necessarily responsible.", "Anyone can report through an online form and there is no vetting of the report.", "In another case, Coleman reads off a headline from another vaccine misinformation website about a man and woman in South Dakota dying a day after getting a vaccine.", "But he doesnt mention that the states department of health concluded that immunization didnt contribute to those deaths.", "There is no evidence that authorized COVID-19 vaccines are harming people on any kind of wide scale.", "While many people have the expected sore arms or temporary flu-like symptoms following vaccination, serious side effects are uncommon.", "A review of the vaccine safety monitoring data in the U.K. through the end of January found that the overall safety experience with the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines is so far as expected from the clinical trials, with the expected benefits far outweigh[ing] any currently known side effects.", "According to the report, severe allergic reactions occurred in a small number of people, but these are very rare and have not resulted in death.", "In the U.S., the vaccine safety monitoring data also is very encouraging.", "Dr. Paul Offit said in a Feb. 11 interview with JAMA that a recent review by the CDCs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices had not revealed any safety signals from the two authorized COVID-19 vaccines.", "One potential issue raised by the trials was that the vaccines might very occasionally trigger a usually temporary form of facial paralysis known as Bells Palsy.", "But so far, Offit said, theres no sign that the condition is any more likely in people who get vaccinated.", "Data from the U.K. also support that finding.", "According to a paper the CDC published in JAMA Insights, cases of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction, following the vaccines in the U.S. are also very unusual   2.5 cases per million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 4.7 cases per million of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, as of Jan. 18.", "Officials in the U.S. are investigating a few instances of thrombocytopenia, or a lack of blood-clotting platelets, following vaccination, including one death.", "But it is still unknown whether that type of reaction can be due to COVID-19 vaccination.", "Even if it is, it would be an extremely rare event and experts say it would pose less risk than the chance of getting COVID-19 and suffering severe health consequences.", "Update, May 14: After investigating 15 cases of a rare clotting condition out of nearly 8 million Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration are warning of a suggested increased risk of the dangerous condition, which occurred in women and resulted in three deaths as of April 21.", "The CDC says women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen.", "As of May 11, 28 cases had been identified out of more than 9 million J&J vaccines administered.", "For more, see Q&A on the Rare Clotting Events That Caused the J&J Pause.", "Its true, of course, that people have died after receiving a vaccine  but this doesnt mean the vaccine is to blame for the deaths.", "Every day, around 8,000 people in the U.S. die from a variety of causes.", "And as the University of California, San Franciscos department of medicine chair Dr. Robert Wachter has pointed out, if 10 million people are vaccinated, in the following two months youd expect 4,025 of those people to have a heart attack, 3,975 to have a stroke and 14,000 to die.", "And the vaccines will have zero to do with any of them, he wrote.", "There are always going to be these temporal associations, and you read about them in the newspaper, said Offit.", "But at least right now, those temporal associations have not been found to be causal associations.", "This is especially the case when vaccines are being given to older people who may not be in good health.", "Older age and chronic underlying illnesses make it more likely that coincidental adverse events will occur, especially given the millions of people vaccinated, the U.K.s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency explains in its report.", "It is therefore important that we carefully review these reports to distinguish possible side effects from illness that would have occurred irrespective of vaccination.", "Throughout the video, Coleman makes a series of other false claims, including the long-debunked notion that COVID-19 has been proved to be no more dangerous than the annual flu.", "Thats wrong.", "While scientists are still trying to pin down how deadly COVID-19 is, studies estimate that between 0.5% and 1.0% of people who are infected with the coronavirus will die  much more than influenzas usually well below 0.1% mortality rate, as weve written.", "And the sheer number of deaths from COVID-19 far outstrip those for influenza.", "As of Feb. 11, more than 470,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, according to the CDC.", "Thats more than the estimated number of flu deaths from the past 10 flu seasons combined  and more than 20 times the number of deaths estimated to have occurred during the 2019-2020 flu season.", "Coleman also cites statements from the World Health Organization to undermine and distort the facts on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.", "The fact is that even the World Health Organization only expects these vaccines to help reduce the extent of the symptoms, he says.", "Theyre not promising that the vaccine will stop people getting COVID-19 and theyre not expecting the vaccine to stop people spreading the infection if they do get it.", "No one can promise that a vaccine will prevent disease in all people, as no vaccine is 100% effective.", "But data from the trials for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, for example, found that vaccinated people were 94% or 95% less likely to develop symptoms of COVID-19 than those who were unvaccinated.", "Its true that the vaccines may not prevent infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as the trials were primarily designed to show that the vaccines kept people from falling ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.", "(See our video on the distinction between virus and disease.)", "But its incorrect to say that the WHO is not expecting the vaccines to do anything for transmission.", "On webpages dedicated to the Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines, the agency simply says that there isnt data or that its not known yet if vaccination will protect against onward transmission.", "The WHO has also said the same more broadly in press briefings.", "In fact, many scientists do expect COVID-19 vaccines to keep people from spreading the virus to at least some degree.", "Thats because its likely an infected but mildly ill or asymptomatic person would shed less virus and therefore be less contagious than a sicker unvaccinated person.", "But because this has not been demonstrated or known to what degree viral spread might be halted, public health officials have been upfront that its possible the vaccines may only prevent disease.", "Editors note: SciChecks COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made

found a very strong data-driven statistical correlation between how quickly a city acted and how quickly they were able to bring the outbreak under control, she said.", "Laura Matrajt, a research associate at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who has modeled the effects of social distancing interventions, also told us Wheelers claim was obviously  false.", "She pointed us to several studies to support the notion that lockdowns can be effective, including a rapid review of 11 European countries, which found that lockdown implementation was associated with a 82% drop in the effective reproduction number, or Rt.", "The measure refers to how many people on average each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time; a number above one indicates a growing epidemic, whereas a number below one means disease transmission is slowing and will eventually peter out.", "According to the paper, the findings suggest a positive effect of the containment measures on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, with a major effect in countries where lockdown started early and was more restrictive.", "A study analyzing data from Europe and the U.S. also concluded that lockdowns likely played a key role in bringing epidemics under control in many places by late April.", "No state had an estimated Rt below 1.0 before lockdown, the authors wrote, but 29 states reached an Rt below 1.0 after lockdown.", "A paper published in June in the journal Nature likewise found that major non-pharmaceutical interventions  and lockdowns in particular  have had a large effect on reducing transmission of the coronavirus.", "A string of other studies have found similar results and other fact-checkers have debunked claims about lockdowns being ineffective.", "Meyers also batted down the notion that lockdowns dont work just because some places with bad outbreaks have implemented stricter measures.", "If we look back at what happened in the spring wave and in New York, it was the growing threat to the hospitals, the growing numbers of cases that led New York to enact its spring 2020 stay home order, she said, noting that in many places governmental restrictions are not full lockdowns.", "That initial wave did subside after people started taking precautions and staying home.", "The same pattern repeated, she said, with the surge of COVID-19 cases in the Sun Belt and in Texas over the summer and with the spike in cases and hospitalizations this winter.", "Were seeing all over the country that as risks start increasing, policies and communication are put in place to encourage these behavioral measures, she said, and when theyre enacted and people adhere to those recommendations, the virus starts slowing.", "Wheeler falsely claims that Fauci admitted to lying when he initially said early last year that widespread use of face masks was not necessary.", "She says: Fauci also said, masks dont work, so please dont buy them, he told us.", "This is actually probably true of cloth masks, but Fauci later admitted he lied to us to manipulate us into not buying masks so that there wouldnt be a shortage for health care workers.", "First, Fauci did not say masks dont work.", "During an interview with CBS 60 Minutes in March 2020, Fauci actually said that masks are important for someone whos infected to prevent them from infecting someone else.", "But he added that face masks generally do not provide the perfect protection from getting infected that people think and so theres no reason to be walking around with a mask.", "Fauci still said he was not against anyone wearing a mask if you want to do it.", "Although, he warned that if everyone wore them it could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it, particularly health care providers and people who were ill. His comments were in line with CDC guidance at the time to conserve face masks for health care workers and those who had COVID-19 and had symptoms.", "Then, in April, after health officials learned more about how much the virus was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, the CDC reversed course and began recommending that everyone wear face coverings in public.", "At that point, Fauci, too, began encouraging universal mask use.", "Fauci later explained the reversal in a June interview with TheStreet, in which he acknowledged that concern for medical workers was a major factor in the early guidance for the public not to wear masks.", "But that doesnt mean Fauci lied to us, as Wheeler claims.", "During a virtual event with the Washington Post in July, Fauci said that, in addition to wanting to preserve face masks for those most in need, health officials truly did not realize the degree to which infected people without symptoms were spreading the virus.", "I mean, back then, the critical issue was to save the masks for the people who really needed them because it was felt that there was a shortage of masks, he said.", "Also, we didnt realize at all the extent of asymptomatic spread and that a person who could be without symptoms at all could inadvertently and innocently spread it to someone who was uninfected.", "Fauci added: But what happened is that as the weeks and months came by, two things became clear: one, that there wasnt a shortage of masks.", "We had plenty of masks and covering that you could put on that, plain cloth covering.", "That took care of that problem.", "Secondly, we fully realized that there were a lot of people who were asymptomatic who were spreading infection.", "So it became clear that we absolutely should be wearing masks consistently.", "Wheeler proceeds to question why people who have previously had COVID-19 are being vaccinated  and in the process, misleadingly claims that natural infection is better than immunization.", "Why are people whove already had COVID-19 and recovered from it getting the vaccine?", "she asks.", "You might say, well, to protect against reinfection.", "But nope, according to a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which followed 12,541 health care workers for 31 weeks after theyd had COVID, six months into the study they found natural immunization was solid.", "They found only two cases of asymptomatic reinfections.", "So why are we vaccinating people whove already recovered from COVID?", "They dont seem to be at risk of reinfection and natural immunization is better than artificial immunization.", "It makes no sense.", "As weve written, many vaccines dont provide quite as good immunity as that triggered by an infection, but that hardly means going that route is better, as contracting the disease is inherently risky.", "And there are numerous vaccines, such as those that protect against tetanus and human papillomavirus, or HPV, that produce superior immunity than natural infection.", "(For more, see our SciCheck story Paul Misleads on Natural Infection and COVID-19 Vaccines.)", "For the coronavirus, its not yet known how immunity from vaccination compares with that from infection.", "Some initial signs suggest that the vaccines produce higher levels of infection-blocking neutralizing antibodies than those seen in patients recovering from COVID-19, but the strength and duration of immunity from both natural infection and immunization remain an area of investigation.", "Regardless, getting vaccinated is far safer than contracting the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2.", "Its true that people who have previously had COVID-19 likely have some immunity for a certain amount of time and therefore arent at high risk of becoming reinfected soon.", "For this reason, some experts have proposed that people who have had COVID-19 should not be prioritized for immunization.", "But theres no way to know for certain whether a person is immune  the so-called correlates of immunity have yet to be worked out for COVID-19  and its unclear how long immunity might last.", "As a result, the CDC website states, Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that re-infection with COVID-19 is possible, vaccine should be offered to you regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 infection.", "Elsewhere, the agency recognizes the lower risk to individuals who have previously had COVID-19, adding that its reasonable for people with infections in the last three months to choose to delay vaccination, at least while vaccines remain in short supply.", "The CDC also advises that people with active coronavirus infections wait until theyve recovered to receive a shot and for anyone who has received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma to delay vaccination for at least 90 days, as those therapies might prevent the vaccine from working.", "Its worth noting that even though the study Wheeler cited does suggest reinfection is rare, she botched some of the details.", "While 12,541 health care workers were included, not all of them had COVID-19.", "Instead, only 1,265 tested positive on a particular antibody test, suggesting they probably had been previously infected.", "Two of those individuals then went on to test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus with a PCR test.", "Millions of health care workers have direct contact with patients and are at high risk of being exposed to the virus or becoming infected and then spreading it to others.", "But Wheeler suggests health care workers have been among the first to be offered the vaccine only because they tend to be more racially diverse than other populations.", "Why are young and otherwise healthy health care workers getting the vaccine before its offered to elderly people in nursing homes, she asks.", "Its not because health care workers are at higher risk; theyre not.", "Elderly people are at the highest risk hands down.", "The only reason health care workers are being vaccinated first is because, as a University of Pennsylvania professor explained, health care workers are more racially diverse while nursing home residents tend to be white.", "So, in other words, the vaccine is being distributed according to critical race theory, not according to science.", "Its true older individuals are at greater risk of being hospitalized or dying from COVID-19, and residents of long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes and assisted-living residences, have been hit especially hard by the pandemic.", "But Wheeler simply ignores that the approximately 21 million U.S. health care workers  who work in settings such as hospitals, outpatient clinics and home health care  are a vulnerable group as well.", "More than 15 million medical workers  of whom 59% are white  are estimated to have direct contact with patients.", "Health care personnels race and ethnicity, underlying health conditions, occupation type, and job setting can contribute to their risk of acquiring COVID-19 and experiencing severe outcomes, including death, the CDC explains.", "By providing critical care to those who are or might be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, health care personnel have a high risk of being exposed to and getting sick with COVID-19.", "The CDC further notes that because those workers cannot provide key services for patients or clients if they contract the virus and become ill, continued protection of them at work, at home, and in the community remains a national priority.", "It also warns that workers who get COVID-19 can spread it to their colleagues, as well as those they are caring for, who may well have underlying health conditions that put them at risk for severe COVID-19 illness.", "That being the case, the CDC, following guidance from the independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, recommended in December that, in the first phase of the vaccine program, state and local officials prioritize giving the first doses available to both health care workers and those living in long-term care facilities.", "(According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, all 50 states and the District of Columbia are vaccinating health care workers and long-term care residents and staff in Phase 1a.", "But 16 states depart from the recommendation in some way, primarily by including other groups to be immunized.)", "The CDC and ACIP say the recommendations are based on evidence-based information about the coronavirus vaccines, with the goal of decreasing death and serious disease, preserving the function of society and reducing the burden COVID-19 is having on people already facing disparities.", "As of Feb. 2, there had been over 391,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,343 deaths among health care workers, according to the CDC.", "But that may be an undercount.", "In December, Kaiser Health News said its joint investigation with the Guardian found that more than 2,900 U.S. health care workers have died in the COVID-19 pandemic since March, a far higher number than that reported by the government.", "The news site said those fatalities have skewed young, with the majority of victims under age 60 in the cases for which there is age data.", "In addition, people of color have been disproportionately affected, accounting for about 65% of deaths in cases in which there is race and ethnicity data, KHN said.", "Wheeler then goes on to distort a study to question why people who arent ill are told to wear masks.", "Speaking of science, why do people who arent sick have to wear masks?", "she asks.", "You might say, well, to prevent asymptomatic transmission.", "But no.", "A new study from the University of Floridas department of biostatistics found that the secondary attack rate for asymptomatic index cases was not statistically different from zero.", "But thats a misinterpretation of that research.", "The senior author of the paper, University of Florida biostatistician Natalie E. Dean, explained in a Twitter thread that her study did not conclude no asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 or that masks and lockdowns are pointless.", "The paper, which was published in the journal JAMA Network Open in December, synthesized and analyzed 54 previously conducted studies to better understand how infectious the coronavirus is within households.", "The studies provided estimates of the secondary attack rate, or how frequently the virus spread to others from an index, or initial, case.", "One of several findings was that far more people contracted COVID-19 if the first infected person in the household had symptoms.", "Specifically, the secondary attack rate was 18.0% when the index case was symptomatic, versus 0.7% when the index case did not have symptoms.", "While this does suggest that transmission of the coronavirus within households is more likely if a person is symptomatic, it does not mean that the virus is not spread from people who arent sick or that theres no reason to wear a mask.", "For one, as our colleagues at PolitiFact and the Associated Press noted when debunking similar claims based on the study, the paper itself cautioned that the secondary attack estimate for index cases without symptoms was based on just four studies  and concluded that important questions remain about infectiousness and symptom severity.", "The combined estimate also included studies assessing the attack rate for people who never develop symptoms, and are asymptomatic, as well as those who havent yet developed symptoms, but will, and are pre-symptomatic.", "As Dean pointed out, its increasingly clear that people who never develop symptoms are less infectious, but pre-symptomatic transmission does occur  and even if less frequent than symptomatic spread, these modes of transmission can still be important to the pandemic.", "If an asymptomatic person is far less infectious but has far more contacts than someone home with a fever, Dean said, it can come out in the wash.", "The attack rate estimates, too, are only for households, not for transmission in the community, which is more relevant to Wheelers complaint about people being told to wear masks in public.", "Finally, while the mask guidance did shift in response to the recognition that people without symptoms can spread the virus  which by some estimates is quite common  that isnt the only reason to wear a mask.", "As the CDC explains, some evidence suggests masks may also provide a degree of protection to the wearer as well.", "How well it protects you from breathing in the virus likely depends on the fabrics used and how your mask is made (e.g.", "the type of fabric, the number of layers of fabric, how well the mask fits), the CDC says.", "Editors note: SciChecks COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.", "The foundation has no control over our editorial decisions, and the views expressed in our articles do not necessarily reflect the views of the foundation.", "The goal of the project is to increase exposure to accurate information about COVID-19 and vaccines, while decreasing the impact of misinformation."], "issues": ["coronavirus", "coronavirus mortality", "COVID-19", "COVID-19 vaccination", "face masks"], "image_data": [{"image_src": null, "image_caption": null}], "data": [{"sentence": "In a video titled Fauci lied to you AGAIN, conservative commentator Liz Wheeler makes a series of false claims about Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the governments most prominent experts on the coronavirus.", "hrefs": ["https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/director"]}, {"sentence": "The Fauci-focused video, which runs nearly four minutes long and has accumulated more than 1.7 million views on Facebook since being posted in early January, also features Wheeler posing several questions about COVID-19 vaccination or mask use.

and Drug Administration granted them each an emergency use authorization in December.", "The trials were overseen by independent data and safety monitoring boards, and the results were reviewed by the FDA and an outside panel of experts.", "So, calling either one an experimental biological agent is misleading.", "In the video, Gold also tells her audience: The reason I dont think this is ever going to be shown to be a race problem is things you just know by common sense.", "One is: Its been all over the world, all races, OK?", "We can just start with that.", "Second is: In areas of the world where people  have those individual risk factors, like diabetes or obesity and other illnesses, and the group risk factors, such as living and working in tight quarters, its not Black people who get it at a worse rate, its those people in those situations.", "Public health experts have called for prioritizing certain members of minority communities in the rollout of the vaccines because those communities have suffered higher rates of infection and death during the pandemic.", "Gold, however, misrepresents the reason for that recommendation, insinuating that experts say Black people are naturally more susceptible to COVID-19.", "But what they actually say is that social and historical factors have led to disparate health impacts on Black and some minority communities, which has led to elevated rates of illness and death from COVID-19.", "For instance, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that Black patients have the highest rates of both diabetes and obesity among racial groups, which, as Gold points out, increases the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.", "In the United States and worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the pervasive impacts of social and structural inequities in society, a paper from the National Academy of Sciences making recommendations on the equitable distribution of the vaccines said.", "COVID-19 is having a disproportionate impact on people who are already disadvantaged by virtue of their race and ethnicity, age, health status, residence, occupation, socioeconomic condition, and/or other contributing factors.", "According to data compiled at the end of 2020 by the CDC, Black Americans had a COVID-19 illness rate 1.4 times higher than their white counterparts and a death rate 2.8 times higher.", "Similarly, a project of American Public Media that tracks the impact of the virus by race found that in 2020, Indigenous, Black and Latino residents were at least 2.7 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than white residents.", "The data on COVID-19 cases and deaths across many states in the U.S. have clearly shown that across all individuals getting the virus, Black and Brown people are disproportionately affected by and dying from this virus, Ren A.S. Robinson, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University whose research focuses, in part, on racial health disparities, told us in an email.", "Biologically, the virus is looking for a host (e.g., a human body) to attack, she said.", "In the U.S., Black and Brown bodies have been disproportionately available for this virus to attack directly due to these communities having less access to equitable healthcare, high risk of exposure occupations, and increased burdens of chronic conditions  all directly related to historic systemic racism and ongoing discrimination and social injustices.", "The plan for distribution of the vaccines, including which populations should be prioritized, was largely left up to the states, though.", "So, the specific priorities of each state differed.", "The CDCs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which issues guidance on vaccine distribution, noted that some racial and ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19.", "Those groups are heavily represented in essential jobs, which have elevated exposure to the virus, ACIP wrote in its Jan. 1 recommendation, explaining that those jobs include: first responders (e.g., firefighters and police officers), corrections officers, food and agricultural workers, U.S.", "Postal Service workers, manufacturing workers, grocery store workers, public transit workers, and those who work in the education sector (teachers and support staff members) as well as child care workers.", "ACIP did not recommend prioritizing the vaccine on the basis of race, but it did recommend prioritizing the vaccine for essential workers.", "In the video, Gold repeatedly cites a report that she describes as the governments words, when she accuses the government of unfairly targeting Black people.", "But its not a government document.", "Its a report from Johns Hopkins Universitys Center for Health Security issued in August that sought to offer those tasked with making the distribution plan an ethical framework for distributing the COVID-19 vaccine.", "After noting that Black people and Native Americans were hospitalized for COVID-19 at a rate five times higher than white people, the report said, As a matter of justice, these disparities in COVID-19 risk and adverse outcomes across racial and ethnic groups should be addressed in our overall COVID-19 response.", "But, again, that was advice offered more than three months before the first vaccine was authorized for use.", "It wasnt binding and it didnt come from the government.", "Since the vaccines have become available, 16 states have publicly reported data on their usage by race and ethnicity, the Kaiser Family Foundation found.", "That data showed that the share of vaccinations among Black people is smaller than their share of cases in all 16 reporting states and smaller than their share of deaths in 15 states, according to KFF.", "Later, Gold insinuates that Black people are being used as unsuspecting test subjects.", "If you take the vaccine, youre signing up to be in a pharmacovigilance tracking system, she says.", "Its worth noting that a popular conspiracy theory had claimed the vaccines would include some kind of tracking device.", "They dont.", "Gold says that the governments plan for distribution was targeting the Black community, which she calls pure racism.", "She goes on to say, It means youve enrolled yourself in a medical trial.", "Most people are not aware that thats what theyre doing.", "This pharmacovigilance tracking system tracks you for two years.", "Its set up by the Department of Defense.", "It was handed off to Oracle and Google to put the data together.", "Golds claims speak to entrenched fears and distrust in Black communities of medical institutions caused by experiments such as the Tuskegee study.", "Gold actually references this experiment in her speech, but fails to explain the difference between what happened then and what is happening now.", "In 1932, in Tuskegee, Alabama, the U.S. government lied to Black men, telling them they were going to receive treatment for bad blood, while they were actually being studied for the effects of untreated syphilis.", "Now, there are two tested and authorized vaccines available to the general public during a global pandemic.", "Susan Rice, who is in charge of White House domestic policy for President Joe Biden, addressed the issue when she was asked at a press briefing about how to overcome vaccine hesitancy in Black communities.", "She noted that Bidens newly established COVID-19 task force is addressing health equity and said, there are Americans, and particularly Americans of color, who for very valid historical reasons are skeptical and reluctant.", "Rice said that the task force is reaching out directly through targeted campaigns to get to those very communities where the skepticism is highest.", "And thats vitally important because as communities of color are suffering disproportionately, may have less access to information about the vaccine, and the ability to easily go online, in some instances, and get an appointment.", "We have to take those additional steps to ensure that they are aware of its availability, they can get appointments and that they understand that the vaccine is safe.", "It is also false that, as Gold claimed, by taking the vaccine youve enrolled yourself in a medical trial.", "Taking the vaccine after its been tested and authorized does not enroll a patient in a trial.", "The tracking system that Gold appears to reference is actually an online management system for vaccine distribution and monitoring.", "One element is v-safe, an online portal to report side effects to the CDC.", "As weve explained before, trial data from the two currently available vaccines show that many people experience pain at the site of injection, fatigue, joint or muscle pain, headache, chills or fever  which, according to the CDC, are normal signs that your body is building protection.", "Use of that portal is optional, not mandatory, Oracle spokeswoman Kris Reeves confirmed to us by email.", "CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund also confirmed to us by email that participation is voluntary.", "Another element of the system acts as a national clearing house for the CDCs anonymized vaccination data, which means that the information doesnt include patients identifying information.", "That data will be used for analysis and reporting by authorized agencies and organizations, Oracle wrote in a press release explaining the system.", "Nothing in Oracles description of the system indicates that it would track individual patients.", "As we said at the start, Gold has a history of spreading dubious claims about COVID-19.", "She started an organization called Americas Frontline Doctors in the summer of 2020, although some of the most visible members of the group didnt actually practice medicine

tests were not always being used appropriately and in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.", "PCR tests are considered a gold standard for diagnostics among scientists, and while false negative and positive results are possible with any test, false positives from PCR tests are not thought to be a major or systemic issue  even positive results at high-cycle threshold

it was designed to do  detect the viral RNA in samples.", "Instead, he said, the tension among scientists concerns whether the values can be used to determine whether someone is, or is not, infectious' to others.", "In other words, the question isnt whether someone contracted the coronavirus, but rather, whether that person is likely to still be contagious and should be told to isolate and have their contacts traced.", "Some would argue that we should be ignoring low-positive PCR results (i.e., those with a high PCR cycle threshold value), as these results may mean that someone is no longer infectious, Binnicker said.", "But, he said, such a result could also mean that a person only very recently became infected and has yet to hit peak infectiousness.", "And, he cautioned, the quality and type of sample can also affect how many cycles are needed to detect the virus, so its not always the case that a high-cycle result means a person is harboring remnants or only small amounts of the virus.", "Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, likewise said getting positive test results at high-cycle threshold values doesnt mean theyre false positive, theyre still actually detecting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.", "Mina said during a call with reporters that the WHOs memo served as a reminder that you have to be discerning about how to evaluate cycle threshold values.", "And if youre going to start using the actual values from the PCR as part of your decision-making, [its important] to really know what it is youre doing.", "For example, if someone is asymptomatic and happened to get a PCR test through testing as part of surveillance in a community, it may be a low viral load detected at a high-cycle threshold value  which could mean you already were infectious and you maybe dont need to be isolated, he said.", "But its very hard to know that.", "You need to do repeated testing, you need to take that person and test them again, he added.", "Or, test them with an antigen test.", "That would be the other way to approach it.", "(Antigen tests are a different type of test that can be used to quickly identify an active coronavirus infection.)", "Binnicker also noted that, since patients who test positive for COVID-19 can sometimes continue to test positive long after recovering, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

vaccine outweigh its risks  all but ensuring the agency would greenlight the vaccine.", "The next day, the FDA followed through and granted the vaccine an emergency use authorization, the first for any COVID-19 vaccine in America.", "Another vaccine from the biotech company Moderna went through the same process a week later.", "That vaccine also protects against disease, but its not known yet if it prevents infection.", "The clip begins with Cuomo asking Fauci why it will still be necessary to wear a face mask even after a person is vaccinated.", "Fauci explains this is because while the vaccine does an excellent job at protecting people from falling ill, it might not prevent infection  and initially there will still be a lot of virus circulating in the population.", "You could be prevented from getting clinical disease, and still have the virus that is in your nasopharynx because you could get infected, he said.", "Were not sure, at this point, that the vaccine protects you against getting infected.", "Here, a voiceover cuts in to repeat Faucis last sentence in a suggestive tone, before allowing him to continue: We know for sure its very, very good, 94%, 95% in protecting you against clinically recognizable disease.", "At this point a voiceover interjects, Clinically recognizable disease, but not COVID?", "The question insinuates that there is something suspicious about what Fauci said, but there isnt.", "Hes only making a distinction between disease and infection.", "Specifically, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was tested in a phase 3 randomized trial in which people were counted as having COVID-19 if they developed at least one symptom of the disease, such as a fever, cough or shortness of breath, and tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus within four days.", "Using this definition, which is quite inclusive, the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease in adults.", "Modernas vaccine, for which the general results were known at the time of the CNN interview, was similarly effective  94.1%  based on a COVID-19 case definition of at least two systemic symptoms, such as fever, chills or headache, and one respiratory symptom, along with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2.", "The trials, however, did not immediately evaluate how well the vaccines were able to prevent infection.", "This is particularly relevant for COVID-19, because while many people develop at least some symptoms, some proportion of people do not.", "It therefore remains possible the two-dose shot keeps people healthy  the primary goal for the vaccines  but that vaccinated people can still become infected and unwittingly transmit the virus.", "Hence, Faucis advice, at least for now, to continue to wear a mask and follow public health precautions, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also endorsed.", "As weve written before, there is a good chance that the authorized COVID-19 shots will help limit transmission to some degree, as that is still common with vaccines that cannot shield against infection but do defend against illness.", "But it nevertheless remains an open question for the COVID-19 vaccines.", "The video misleads again when the voiceover repeats Faucis statement that the vaccine protected people against severe disease and then asks, Well, then, what does he call COVID, if thats not serious?", "That misunderstands COVID-19 and how differently it affects various people.", "As weve already noted, infection with SARS-CoV-2 does not always produce symptoms in people.", "For most individuals, the symptoms are relatively mild.", "But in some patients, particularly those who are older or who have certain health conditions, COVID-19 can be deadly  and for others, symptoms can linger.", "Fauci was referring to the ability of the vaccine to prevent a severe case of COVID-19.", "In both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials, severe disease was defined as having confirmed COVID-19 and at least one sign of serious illness, such as a blood oxygen level below 93%, respiratory failure or admission to the intensive care unit.", "In the Moderna trial, all 30 cases of severe COVID-19 occurred in the placebo group at the time of the FDAs evaluation.", "One severe case was later identified in the vaccine group.", "Few volunteers in the Pfizer/BioNTech trial developed severe

McDonald and Catalina Jaramillo", "posted": null, "sci_digest": ["A viral video makes a series of inaccurate and unfounded arguments for why people should not receive any vaccines, including those for COVID-19., As COVID-19 cases continue to rise across the globe, anti-vaccination activists try to undermine peoples confidence by spreading misinformation around the safety, efficacy and value of the COVID-19 vaccines., A 14-minute long video posted on January 13 by Steven Baker, a licensed chiropractor from Idaho, on Facebook and Instagram gives people five reasons why they should definitely never vaccinate.", "The video has been liked since by 1,600 viewers on Facebook and viewed by over 50,000 on Instagram., Baker, who describes himself as a healer whos not anti-vaccine but anti-everything, has created a business selling misinformation about vaccines.", "In April, Facebook removed Bakers ad account and page after he falsely claimed that a silver spray sold on his website protected people from COVID-19.", "In another video shared on TikTok and fact-checked by PolitiFact, he said people were dying because of the economic collapse caused by the pandemic, not from COVID-19., In this video, Baker adds a disclaimer saying hes not giving medical advice.", "But he is., The first reason Baker gives to not get vaccinated is the ingredients in the vaccines.", "You wouldnt give your kid a shot of thimerosal, aluminum, aborted fetal tissue, chicken and eggs embryo  you wouldnt, he argues., But the fact is you probably already have for most of those items, and research shows the ingredients in vaccines are not harmful.", "Also, the two U.S. authorized COVID-19 vaccines dont contain any of those ingredients., Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative used in multi-dose vaccines to help prevent potentially deadly contamination from harmful microbes.", "Although most vaccines for children dont use it anymore, some influenza vaccines still do.", "Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, a kind of mercury thats safer than methylmercury, which can be found in certain fish and animals.", "Ethylmercury is less toxic because it is broken down and excreted rapidly by the body.", "According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the amount of mercury contained in a vaccine is roughly the same amount contained in a 3 ounce can of tuna fish., Aluminum salts are present in some vaccines.", "They are also found in some health products such as buffered aspirin and antacids, as well as in many foods and beverages, including fruit and vegetables, cereals, nuts, dairy products, flour, honey, and baby formula.", "The quantities of aluminum contained in vaccines are low and regulated.", "According to the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, the amount of aluminum infants receive in their first six months of life from vaccines is about eight times lower than what they receive from formula, and about half of what they receive from breast milk in that same amount of time., Some vaccines are made in eggs  the influenza and yellow fever vaccines  therefore they contain egg proteins.", "Eggs from chickens raised on a farm are technically chicken embryos if fertilized by a rooster., Finally, Baker names fetal tissue as a vaccine ingredient.", "Thats not accurate.", "Fetal cells obtained from two aborted pregnancies in the early 1960s, one in Sweden and one in England, were made into cell lines that are used to grow virus to make some vaccines, such as varicella (chickenpox), rubella and hepatitis A.", "But those cells arent present in the vaccines themselves, since the virus is purified before it goes into a syringe., Asweveexplained, thePfizer/BioNTechand theModernaCOVID-19 vaccinesarent made from a virus.", "According to the CDC, neither vaccine contains eggs, preservatives or latex., Vaccines do not go directly into the bloodstream, as Baker says in the video.", "Instead, most vaccines are injected into muscle or skin., Baker goes on to incorrectly say that vaccines dont work because they dont prevent the virus or bacteria from getting in your body.", "What they do is that they reduce the amount of symptoms that you have from that bacteria or virus., Many vaccines are in fact helpful precisely because they reduce symptoms  less severe disease means less suffering and fewer deaths.", "This is a huge part of why vaccines have been so beneficial to society., It is true that not all vaccines can prevent infection, or do so fully.", "But thats not a requirement for a vaccine to be effective.", "A vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a product that stimulates a persons immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease., The idea is to train the immune system to recognize a particular pathogen so that if someone does encounter the germ, they will either not become infected or will not get sick  or if they do have symptoms, they will be less severe.", "This usually involves introducing a piece of or a small amount of weakened or killed virus or bacteria into the body., Some vaccines produce whats called sterilizing immunity, which is when antibodies glom onto a pathogen and remove it before it has a chance to enter cells and set up an infection.", "This happens, for example, with the measles, hepatitis A and human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccines., If youre given the measles vaccine  two doses  you have a 97% chance of being protected against measles for the rest of your life.", "And not just disease  also asymptomatic infection, Dr. Paul A. Offit,a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, told us, referring to when someone is infected but doesnt have symptoms.", "Youre done with that virus., Many other vaccines, Offit said, including seasonal influenza, rotavirus, whooping cough and pneumococcal vaccines, keep people from becoming seriously ill but arent able to prevent infection.", "Thats okay, he said, because the main goal youre trying to do in these cases is prevent children or adults from being hospitalized or killed., Importantly, many vaccines can still reduce the spread of a disease even if they dont stop infection, contrary to Bakers other claim that vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, dont prevent transmission., That can happen, Offit said, because a vaccinated person often sheds less virus, making them less contagious., Its not known yet whether the authorized COVID-19 vaccines prevent transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but its likely the same dynamic will be at play and the vaccines will limit transmission to some degree., Until more is known, its important that people who receive a COVID-19 vaccine dont assume they cant pass the virus on to others  and continue to wear masks and physically distance  but its also premature for Baker to declare the vaccines to be useless in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2., As part of Bakers specious argument that vaccines dont work, he brings up the example of polio and falsely says the disease subsided because of sanitation, not vaccination., Obviously, polio went away because of sanitation because its a fecal-oral disease, Baker says.", "And if you start washing your hands and not drinking water in the streets, youre probably not going to get polio., While better sanitation helps reduce the spread of poliovirus, which is passed along primarily through feces but can also be spread through infectious droplets from sneezes or coughs, it is vaccination that is credited with eliminating the virus in the U.S., After all, sanitation was quite good in 1950s America, but polio was still a major threat to families every summer., Perhaps counterintuitively, improved sanitation is thought to be why there was a surge in polio cases in the U.S. in the beginning of the early 20th century., Before 1910, polio was silently circulating, explained Micaela Martinez, an infectious disease ecologist at Columbia University who has studied the history of the disease., The virus was rampant, she said, but because virtually everyone would become infected as an infant when there is a low risk of getting severe disease and developing paralysis, it wasnt particularly noticed., As sanitation improved, however, children wouldnt encounter the virus until they were older, when the risk of paralysis was greater.", "So sanitation actually led to this first emergence of polio as being a widespread paralytic disease, Martinez told us., Polio epidemics became even worse after World War II with the baby boom, as more children were around to further spread the disease, she added.", "It wasnt until vaccines arrived that cases began to fall  from more than 15,000 paralysis cases every year, according to the CDC, to fewer than 100 annually in the 1960s and fewer than 10 each year in the following decade., The disease was eliminated in the U.S. in 1979, meaning there is no ongoing transmission of polio in the country, and no cases have originated in the U.S. since that time.", "Polio vaccination is still important, however, as the disease could be introduced at any time by travelers., Baker proceeds to incorrectly say that there is no such thing as a safe trial with vaccines, because no vaccines are tested against what he considers true placebos.", "This is categorically false., What they do is they actually compare the vaccine that theyre testing to a different vaccine, or they will compare the vaccine theyre testing to a syringe that is full of aluminum and everything in the vaccine, except for the antigen, he says, referring to the part of the vaccine that will trigger the specific immune response., In fact, many vaccines have been tested against a saline, or saltwater, placebo in randomized controlled trials, including influenza and certain mumps, polio and measles vaccines.", "But there are also good reasons to use different placebo controls in trials  and it does not mean a vaccine has not been fully vetted for safety., For example, as outlined by a World Health Organization expert panel, if a safe and effective vaccine against a specific disease already exists, then the real question becomes whether the new vaccine performs similarly or better, and in many cases it would be unethical to deprive a group of people of a protective vaccine., It is also argued, Offit said, that its not fair to enroll participants in a vaccine trial and not give them something of benefit, which sometimes means giving a different vaccine as a control., Another potential reason for deviating from a saline placebo is preserving the blinding of a trial, making sure volunteers in trials dont know whether they have been randomly assigned to the control group, since many vaccines do have some minor, temporary side effects, such as arm soreness, that can clue participants into which shot they received., Baker gets his facts wrong once again when says the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was tested against a meningitis vaccine.", "Both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, which are the only two COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized for use in the U.S., were tested against a saline placebo., Some arms of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trial did include a meningococcal vaccine as a control to reduce the chance that control volunteers would know they didnt get the COVID-19 vaccine.", "Thats true of the U.K. portion of the trial and part of the Brazilian trial, which used the meningococcal group A, C, W and Y conjugate vaccine as a control for the first dose, but not the second., Saline, however, was used for the South African arm of the trial and the 30,000-person trial in the U.S., which is still ongoing., Baker also argues people should not get vaccinated because vaccines are not safe and companies are not liable., You cannot sue them, but yet they have a special court.", "And that special court to date has paid out over $4 billion in damages, he says., Baker is referring to the National Vaccines Injury Compensation Program, created by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986., Vaccines are extensively tested to ensure theyre effective and safe.", "But just like any other medication, theyre not risk-free and can cause adverse events or side effects.", "Most vaccines can cause pain, redness or tenderness where they were injected, and some can cause more severe events., Beginning in the mid-1970s, several lawsuits were filed against vaccine-makers and health care providers, which led manufacturers to stop their production.", "They were forced to pay for damages despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting injury claims.", "The threats of a vaccine shortage moved Congress to pass the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which creates a compensation fund.", "According to thelatest data, the government has paid out nearly $4.2 billion in compensation since 1988., But as we have previously explained, the fact that there have been payouts doesnt mean that vaccines caused an injury.", "According to the Health Resources and Services Administration, approximately 70% of all compensation awarded by the fund is a result of a negotiated settlement between the parties, previous to any review of the evidence, to save time and money., Still, the number of complaints and compensations is very low.", "Over 3.7 billion doses of covered vaccines were distributed in the U.S. from 2006 to 2018, according to the CDC.", "In that same period of time, only 7,589 petitions were adjudicated and of those 5,317 were compensated., The World Health Organization estimates thatimmunizations prevent 2 to 3 million deaths every year globally.In the U.S., the CDC estimates flu vaccines averted 105,000 hospitalizations and 6,300 deaths in the 2019-2020 season, according to preliminary data.", ", The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act also requires health care providers to report side effects occurring after immunization to the Vaccines Adverse Event Reporting System, a program created in 1990 and co-administrated by the CDC and the FDA., The act also allows individuals to pursue legal action against a vaccine manufacturer under certain conditions, including negligence on the part of the vaccine-maker., In the video, Baker falsely claims that unvaccinated children are healthier than vaccinated children and cites a study published in November 2020 in International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, an open-access journal.", "The journal says it is peer-reviewed but its lack of rigor has been cause for concern.", "The quality of its publisher, Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute, has also been questioned  in 2018, 10 senior editors resigned, saying they were being pressured to receive mediocre studies., Update, Aug. 11: The study,which claimed thatkids with fewer vaccinations had fewer office visitsat one of the authors private practices, wasretractedby the journal on July 22, following concerns regarding the validity of the conclusions.", "Adhering to our complaints procedure, an investigation was conducted that raised several methodological issues and confirmed that the conclusions were not supported by strong scientific data, the retraction reads., The study isco-authored by James Lyons-Weiler and Paul Thomas, and funded by The Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, a nonprofit directed by Lyons-Weiler, a scientist who has been spreading misleading information on COVID-19 and vaccines for years., Thomas, a pediatrician in Portland, Oregon, had his license revoked in December for failing to adequately vaccinate patients.", "According to the Oregon Medical Board, his conduct has breached the standard of care and has placed the health and safety of many of his patients at serious risk of harm.", "One of his unvaccinated patients developed a severe case of tetanus that required a two-month stay in an intensive care unit., In the video, Baker baselessly accuses the CDC of profiting off vaccines and falsely states that Dr. Thomas license was removed because of the truth revealed in his study.", "The CDC is not in the business to make you safe or help you and your kids, the CDC is in the business of marketing vaccines and profiting off of you and your family getting vaccinated, period, he argues., Vaccination is essential because it helps provide immunity and prevents potential life-threatening diseases, according to the CDC.", "All vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, meet rigorous safety criteria set by the FDA., The fact of the matter is, not shockingly, people who are vaccinated are healthier because theyre not likely to catch bacterial and viral infections, Offit said.", "Theres not a year that goes by at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia where we do not see a child suffer and die from a vaccine-preventable disease because the parent chose not to vaccinate them., The top reason to avoid all vaccinations, Baker baselessly says, is that vaccines cause autoimmune diseases.", "He even goes so far as to say that COVID-19 vaccines will create millions and millions of people with an autoimmune disease.", "There is no evidence for that., Baker betrays his lack of knowledge on the subject by claiming this happens because with vaccines you are bypassing natural defenses instead of having a true actual immune response and by likening vaccination to getting an organ transplant in which you need drugs to suppress the immune system., But vaccination is nothing like an organ transplant.", "And vaccines only temporarily activate the immune system, doing so in a safer way than natural infection., Since vaccines dont drive the immune response nearly as vigorously as natural infections do, it is less likely that they would induce autoimmunity, explains the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphias website., Scientists have looked into whether vaccines trigger autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, and have come up empty, with no clear signal that they do., Its okay to ask the question, Offit said, but when study after study after study shows that vaccines dont induce autoimmunity and it doesnt make sense they would induce autoimmunity, people should believe them., One autoimmune disorder, Guillain-Barr syndrome, has been linked to influenza vaccination, but inconsistently so  and at very low frequencies, around 1 to 2 in 1 million doses.", "Most people who develop the condition fully recover, although some people are left with permanent nerve damage and some people die., Cases of the disease also follow infections, and research shows that the risk of developing Guillain-Barr from flu is much higher than after immunization with a flu shot., In another rare instance, a pandemic flu vaccine in Europe in 2009-2010 may have provoked some people with a genetic predisposition to develop an autoimmune reaction that led to narcolepsy.", "But in that case as well, its not entirely clear what role the vaccine played, and its possible natural infection with influenza poses a similar or higher risk., While scientists continue to monitor for any sign that immunizations might lead to autoimmunity, there is no basis for Bakers claim that vaccines, including those for COVID-19, are dangerous because they cause autoimmune diseases., Clarification, Jan. 28: We have removed the Dr. title for Baker.", "As we wrote in our story, Baker is not a medical doctor., Editors note: SciChecks COVID-19/Vaccination Project

video shared on TikTok and fact-checked by PolitiFact, he said people were dying because of the economic collapse caused by the pandemic, not from COVID-19.", "In this video, Baker adds a disclaimer saying hes not giving medical advice.", "But he is.", "The first reason Baker gives to not get vaccinated is the ingredients in the vaccines.", "You wouldnt give your kid a shot of thimerosal, aluminum, aborted fetal tissue, chicken and eggs embryo  you wouldnt, he argues.", "But the fact is you probably already have for most of those items, and research shows the ingredients in vaccines are not harmful.", "Also, the two U.S. authorized COVID-19 vaccines dont contain any of those ingredients.", "Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative used in multi-dose vaccines to help prevent potentially deadly contamination from harmful microbes.", "Although most vaccines for children dont use it anymore, some influenza vaccines still do.", "Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, a kind of mercury thats safer than methylmercury, which can be found in certain fish and animals.", "Ethylmercury is less toxic because it is broken down and excreted rapidly by the body.", "According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the amount of mercury contained in a vaccine is roughly the same amount contained in a 3 ounce can of tuna fish.", "Aluminum salts are present in some vaccines.", "They are also found in some health products such as buffered aspirin and antacids, as well as in many foods and beverages, including fruit and vegetables, cereals, nuts, dairy products, flour, honey, and baby formula.", "The quantities of aluminum contained in vaccines are low and regulated.", "According to the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, the amount of aluminum infants receive in their first six months of life from vaccines is about eight times lower than what they receive from formula, and about half of what they receive from breast milk in that same amount of time.", "Some vaccines are made in eggs  the influenza and yellow fever vaccines  therefore they contain egg proteins.", "Eggs from chickens raised on a farm are technically chicken embryos if fertilized by a rooster.", "Finally, Baker names fetal tissue as a vaccine ingredient.", "Thats not accurate.", "Fetal cells obtained from two aborted pregnancies in the early 1960s, one in Sweden and one in England, were made into cell lines that are used to grow virus to make some vaccines, such as varicella (chickenpox), rubella and hepatitis A.", "But those cells arent present in the vaccines themselves, since the virus is purified before it goes into a syringe.", "As weve explained, the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines arent made from a virus.", "According to the CDC, neither vaccine contains eggs, preservatives or latex.", "Vaccines do not go directly into the bloodstream, as Baker says in the video.", "Instead, most vaccines are injected into muscle or skin.", "Baker goes on to incorrectly say that vaccines dont work because they dont prevent the virus or bacteria from getting in your body.", "What they do is that they reduce the amount of symptoms that you have from that bacteria or virus.", "Many vaccines are in fact helpful precisely because they reduce symptoms  less severe disease means less suffering and fewer deaths.", "This is a huge part of why vaccines have been so beneficial to society.", "It is true that not all vaccines can prevent infection, or do so fully.", "But thats not a requirement for a vaccine to be effective.", "A vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a product that stimulates a persons immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease.", "The idea is to train the immune system to recognize a particular pathogen so that if someone does encounter the germ, they will either not become infected or will not get sick  or if they do have symptoms, they will be less severe.", "This usually involves introducing a piece of or a small amount of weakened or killed virus or bacteria into the body.", "Some vaccines produce whats called sterilizing immunity, which is when antibodies glom onto a pathogen and remove it before it has a chance to enter cells and set up an infection.", "This happens, for example, with the measles, hepatitis A and human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccines.", "If youre given the measles vaccine  two doses  you have a 97% chance of being protected against measles for the rest of your life.", "And not just disease  also asymptomatic infection, Dr. Paul A. Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, told us, referring to when someone is infected but doesnt have symptoms.", "Youre done with that virus.", "Many other vaccines, Offit said, including seasonal influenza, rotavirus, whooping cough and pneumococcal vaccines, keep people from becoming seriously ill but arent able to prevent infection.", "Thats okay, he said, because the main goal youre trying to do in these cases is prevent children or adults from being hospitalized or killed.", "Importantly, many vaccines can still reduce the spread of a disease even if they dont stop infection, contrary to Bakers other claim that vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, dont prevent transmission.", "That can happen, Offit said, because a vaccinated person often sheds less virus, making them less contagious.", "Its not known yet whether the authorized COVID-19 vaccines prevent transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but its likely the same dynamic will be at play and the vaccines will limit transmission to some degree.", "Until more is known, its important that people who receive a COVID-19 vaccine dont assume they cant pass the virus on to others  and continue to wear masks and physically distance  but its also premature for Baker to declare the vaccines to be useless in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.", "As part of Bakers specious argument that vaccines dont work, he brings up the example of polio and falsely says the disease subsided because of sanitation, not vaccination.", "Obviously, polio went away because of sanitation because its a fecal-oral disease, Baker says.", "And if you start washing your hands and not drinking water in the streets, youre probably not going to get polio.", "While better sanitation helps reduce the spread of poliovirus, which is passed along primarily through feces but can also be spread through infectious droplets from sneezes or coughs, it is vaccination that is credited with eliminating the virus in the U.S.  After all, sanitation was quite good in 1950s America, but polio was still a major threat to families every summer.", "Perhaps counterintuitively, improved sanitation is thought to be why there was a surge in polio cases in the U.S. in the beginning of the early 20th century.", "Before 1910, polio was silently circulating, explained Micaela Martinez, an infectious disease ecologist at Columbia University who has studied the history of the disease.", "The virus was rampant, she said, but because virtually everyone would become infected as an infant when there is a low risk of getting severe disease and developing paralysis, it wasnt particularly noticed.", "As sanitation improved, however, children wouldnt encounter the virus until they were older, when the risk of paralysis was greater.", "So sanitation actually led to this first emergence of polio as being a widespread paralytic disease, Martinez told us.", "Polio epidemics became even worse after World War II with the baby boom, as more children were around to further spread the disease, she added.", "It wasnt until vaccines arrived that cases began to fall  from more than 15,000 paralysis cases every year, according to the CDC, to fewer than 100 annually in the 1960s and fewer than 10 each year in the following decade.", "The disease was eliminated in the U.S. in 1979, meaning there is no ongoing transmission of polio in the country, and no cases have originated in the U.S. since that time.", "Polio vaccination is still important, however, as the disease could be introduced at any time by travelers.", "Baker proceeds to incorrectly say that there is no such thing as a safe trial with vaccines, because no vaccines are tested against what he considers true placebos.", "This is categorically false.", "What they do is they actually compare the vaccine that theyre testing to a different vaccine, or they will compare the vaccine theyre testing to a syringe that is full of aluminum and everything in the vaccine, except for the antigen, he says, referring to the part of the vaccine that will trigger the specific immune response.", "In fact, many vaccines have been tested against a saline, or saltwater, placebo in randomized controlled trials, including influenza and certain mumps, polio and measles vaccines.", "But there are also good reasons to use different placebo controls in trials  and it does not mean a vaccine has not been fully vetted for safety.", "For example, as outlined by a World Health Organization expert panel, if a safe and effective vaccine against a specific disease already exists, then the real question becomes whether the new vaccine performs similarly or better, and in many cases it would be unethical to deprive a group of people of a protective vaccine.", "It is also argued, Offit said, that its not fair to enroll participants in a vaccine trial and not give them something of benefit, which sometimes means giving a different vaccine as a control.", "Another potential reason for deviating from a saline placebo is preserving the blinding of a trial, making sure volunteers in trials dont know whether they have been randomly assigned to the control group, since many vaccines do have some minor, temporary side effects, such as arm soreness, that can clue participants into which shot they received.", "Baker gets his facts wrong once again when says the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was tested against a meningitis vaccine.", "Both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, which are the only two COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized for use in the U.S., were tested against a saline placebo.", "Some arms of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trial did include a meningococcal vaccine as a control to reduce the chance that control volunteers would know they didnt get the COVID-19 vaccine.", "Thats true of the U.K. portion of the trial and part of the Brazilian trial, which used the meningococcal group A, C, W and Y conjugate vaccine as a control for the first dose, but not the second.", "Saline, however, was used for the South African arm of the trial and the 30,000-person trial in the U.S., which is still ongoing.", "Baker also argues people should not get vaccinated because vaccines are not safe and companies are not liable.", "You cannot sue them, but yet they have a special court.", "And that special court to date has paid out over $4 billion in damages, he says.", "Baker is referring to the National Vaccines Injury Compensation Program, created by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.", "Vaccines are extensively tested to ensure theyre effective and safe.", "But just like any other medication, theyre not risk-free and can cause adverse events or side effects.", "Most vaccines can cause pain, redness or tenderness where they were injected, and some can cause more severe events.", "Beginning in the mid-1970s, several lawsuits were filed against vaccine-makers and health care providers, which led manufacturers to stop their production.", "They were forced to pay for damages despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting injury claims.", "The threats of a vaccine shortage moved Congress to pass the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which creates a compensation fund.", "According to the latest data, the government has paid out nearly $4.2 billion in compensation since 1988.", "But as we have previously explained, the fact that there have been payouts doesnt mean that vaccines caused an injury.", "According to the Health Resources and Services Administration, approximately 70% of all compensation awarded by the fund is a result of a negotiated settlement between the parties, previous to any review of the evidence, to save time and money.", "Still, the number of complaints and compensations is very low.", "Over 3.7 billion doses of covered vaccines were distributed in the U.S. from 2006 to 2018, according to the CDC.", "In that same period of time, only 7,589 petitions were adjudicated and of those 5,317 were compensated.", "The World Health Organization estimates that immunizations prevent 2 to 3 million deaths every year globally.", "In the U.S., the CDC estimates flu vaccines averted 105,000 hospitalizations and 6,300 deaths in the 2019-2020 season, according to preliminary data.", "The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act also requires health care providers to report side effects occurring after immunization to the Vaccines Adverse Event Reporting System, a program created in 1990 and co-administrated by the CDC and the FDA.", "The act also allows individuals to pursue legal action against a vaccine manufacturer under certain conditions, including negligence on the part of the vaccine-maker.", "In the video, Baker falsely claims that unvaccinated children are healthier than vaccinated children and cites a study published in November 2020 in International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, an open-access journal.", "The journal says it is peer-reviewed but its lack of rigor has been cause for concern.", "The quality of its publisher, Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute, has also been questioned  in 2018, 10 senior editors resigned, saying they were being pressured to receive mediocre studies.", "Update, Aug. 11: The study, which claimed that kids with fewer vaccinations had fewer office visits at one of the authors private practices, was retracted by the journal on July 22, following concerns regarding the validity of the conclusions.", "Adhering to our complaints procedure, an investigation was conducted that raised several methodological issues and confirmed that the conclusions were not supported by strong scientific data, the retraction reads.", "The study is co-authored by James Lyons-Weiler and Paul Thomas, and funded by The Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, a nonprofit directed by Lyons-Weiler, a scientist who has been spreading misleading information on COVID-19 and vaccines for years.", "Thomas, a pediatrician in Portland, Oregon, had his license revoked in December for failing to adequately vaccinate patients.", "According to the Oregon Medical Board, his conduct has breached the standard of care and has placed the health and safety of many of his patients at serious risk of harm.", "One of his unvaccinated patients developed a severe case of tetanus that required a two-month stay in an intensive care unit.", "In the video, Baker baselessly accuses the CDC of profiting off vaccines and falsely states that Dr. Thomas license was removed because of the truth revealed in his study.", "The CDC is not in the business to make you safe or help you and your kids, the CDC is in the business of marketing vaccines and profiting off of you and your family getting vaccinated, period, he argues.", "Vaccination is essential because it helps provide immunity and prevents potential life-threatening diseases, according to the CDC.", "All vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, meet rigorous safety criteria set by the FDA.", "The fact of the matter is, not shockingly, people who are vaccinated are healthier because theyre not likely to catch bacterial and viral infections, Offit said.", "Theres not a year that goes by at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia where we do not see a child suffer and die from a vaccine-preventable disease because the parent chose not to vaccinate them.", "The top reason to avoid all vaccinations, Baker baselessly says, is that vaccines cause autoimmune diseases.", "He even goes so far as to say that COVID-19 vaccines will create millions and millions of people with an autoimmune disease.", "There is no evidence for that.", "Baker betrays his lack of knowledge on the subject by claiming this happens because with vaccines you are bypassing natural defenses instead of having a true actual immune response and by likening vaccination to getting an organ transplant in which you need drugs to suppress the immune system.", "But vaccination is nothing like an organ transplant.", "And vaccines only temporarily activate the immune system, doing so in a safer way than natural infection.", "Since vaccines dont drive the immune response nearly as vigorously as natural infections do, it is less likely that they would induce autoimmunity, explains the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphias website.", "Scientists have looked into whether vaccines trigger autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, and have come up empty, with no clear signal that they do.", "Its okay to ask the question, Offit said, but when study after study after study shows that vaccines dont induce autoimmunity and it doesnt make sense they would induce autoimmunity, people should believe them.", "One autoimmune disorder, Guillain-Barr syndrome, has been linked to influenza vaccination, but inconsistently so  and at very low frequencies, around 1 to 2 in 1 million doses.", "Most people who develop the condition fully recover, although some people are left with permanent nerve damage and some people die.", "Cases of the disease also follow infections, and research shows that the risk of developing Guillain-Barr from flu is much higher than after immunization with a flu shot.", "In another rare instance, a pandemic flu vaccine in Europe in 2009-2010 may have provoked some people with a genetic predisposition to develop an autoimmune reaction that led to narcolepsy.", "But in that case as well, its not entirely clear what role the vaccine played, and its possible natural infection with influenza poses a similar or higher risk.", "While scientists continue to monitor for any sign that immunizations might lead to autoimmunity, there is no basis for Bakers claim that vaccines, including those for COVID-19, are dangerous because they cause autoimmune diseases.",

number of genetic changes and was first identified in southeastern England when public health officials were investigating a spike in COVID-19 cases in early December, with the earliest instances stemming from patient samples taken in September.", "The variant began to quickly dominate in the region and also spread to other parts of the U.K., where it replaced other viral lineages.", "While it is not always easy to determine whether that type of pattern necessarily means a virus has evolved to become more contagious, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch told us he believed there was now a consensus that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible, noting that data from multiple places in the UK are compelling.", "The most direct evidence of an increase in transmissibility comes from contact tracing data, Davies said.", "Public Health England found that as of Dec. 20, 14.7% of those in contact with people infected with B.1.1.7 contracted COVID-19, compared with 11% for those not infected with the variant.", "Researchers also have used modeling or other statistical techniques to estimate how much more infectious B.1.1.7 is.", "Davies group, for instance, pegged B.1.1.7 as 56% more infectious than preexisting versions of the virus in a preliminary, unpublished preprint released at the end of December.", "Scientists at Imperial College London also released an unpublished report that estimated the variant increased the reproduction number, or how many people on average each person with COVID-19 infects, by 0.4 to 0.7.", "Davies said that while its hard to pin down an exact estimate  the numbers vary based on the models  B.1.1.7 is likely somewhere between 30% and 70% more contagious.", "Preliminary data from the National Health Service initially suggested that B.1.1.7 does not cause more severe COVID-19 compared with past versions of the virus, as there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of people infected with the variant who were hospitalized or died within 28 days compared with those infected with other strains.", "Subsequently, however, British authorities revealed on Jan. 22 that four analyses indicated there was a realistic possibility that B.1.1.7 could be more lethal, although they cautioned that this was based on limited data and was still uncertain.", "Even if B.1.1.7 doesnt cause more severe COVID-19 symptoms, experts caution that an increase in transmissibility can still lead to a large number of deaths.", "In fact, because of the exponential nature of viral spread, an increase in contagiousness can have a bigger effect than the same uptick in a viruss virulence, or ability to harm a host.", "Running the math on a hypothetical virus with similar characteristics to SARS-CoV-2 in a city with 10,000 infections, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine mathematician and infectious disease researcher Adam Kucharski explained on Twitter that a variant thats 50% more deadly would eventually kill 64 additional people after a month, but a variant thats 50% more transmissible would claim an extra 849 lives.", "Of B.1.1.7s 23 mutations, 17 change the protein sequence and eight of these occur in the viruss spike  the protein that sticks out from the surface and is used to enter human cells.", "Specifically, B.1.1.7 has a mutation known as N501Y (the name refers to a change in the protein sequence at position 501 from the amino acid asparagine to tyrosine).", "This is of particular note because it occurs in the receptor binding domain  the spot on the spike that binds to the ACE2 receptor on human cells  and previous experiments suggest it enables the virus to bind to the human receptor more tightly.", "A study in mice also found that making this change allowed the animals to be more easily infected and to get sick.", "Other mutations of interest include a short deletion that is predicted to alter the shape of the spike protein and another change near an enzyme-binding site that could affect how the virus enters cells.", "While the mechanism for why B.1.1.7 is more contagious still needs to be studied, tighter binding to human cells  due to the N501Y mutation or perhaps in combination with other mutations  could account for the phenomenon.", "As you breathe in some virus, if the virus is more efficient at latching on to its target surface, youre more likely to get an infection, explained Shane Crotty, an infectious disease researcher who studies COVID-19 at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, in an interview with the YouTube channel MedCram.", "Crotty also pointed to preliminary work from a governmental lab in the U.K. indicating that people infected with B.1.1.7 had higher viral loads, or levels of the virus, in their noses than people harboring other strains.", "If thats true, it would say that this U.K. variant has amassed a set of mutations that let it grow a lot better in nasal passages than the previous virus and that theres literally just a lot more virus in peoples nose, he said.", "If theres just more virus coming out of you when youre breathing or sneezing or coughing, then obviously its going to be more likely to able to infect people near you.", "So far, B.1.1.7 remains rare in the U.S., and it does not explain the surge of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations that began in the fall.", "Duncan MacCannell, the chief science officer with the CDCs Office of Advanced Molecular Detection, told the Washington Post on Jan. 11 that he estimated that only 0.5% of COVID-19 transmission in the country involves the variant.", "But many scientists expect the proportion of COVID-19 cases due to the variant will rise.", "Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist studying viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and co-developer of Nextstrain, said in a Jan. 7 interview with NPR that based on the timeframe observed in the U.K., he thought B.1.1.7 could become the dominant strain in the U.S. by March.", "CDC modeling, shared in a Jan. 15 report from the agency, similarly concluded that B.1.1.7 could become the predominant variant in the month of March.", "Compared with its U.K. counterpart, less is known about B.1.351, which was first observed in South Africa.", "In a preprint posted on Dec. 22, scientists noted that the variant quickly came to be the dominant virus in the countrys two most southern provinces and might be more transmissible.", "Few research groups have attempted to quantify the variants possible increase in contagiousness, although one tentatively estimated it to be 50% more infectious, with a range between 20% and 113%.", "According to the same unpublished report, the case fatality ratio did rise in the region as the variant took over, suggesting a possible effect on disease severity, but there is no firm evidence that B.1.351 is more deadly than ancestral viruses.", "Davies, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine epidemiologist who also co-authored the preprint, explained that the proportion of people dying could have gone up for a variety of reasons unrelated to a change in viral virulence.", "When hospitals are under more pressure the standard of care that theyre able to provide tends to go down, he said.", "So it could be, for example, that because [the variant is] more transmissible, theyre seeing more cases, and theyre less able to treat the people coming in.", "B.1.351 harbors multiple mutations in its spike protein, three of which occur in the receptor binding domain.", "This includes N501Y  the key mutation in B.1.1.7  and another one nearby, E484K.", "E484K is especially noteworthy, as researchers have found that the mutation reduces the ability of antibodies collected from people who recovered from COVID-19 to neutralize the virus.", "This raises concerns that the variant could pose more of a risk to populations because it could be better at reinfecting people and vaccines might not work as well against the variant.", "Most scientists, however, caution against assuming the worst.", "As Jesse Bloom, a researcher who studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center whose lab performed the antibody experiments, explained on Twitter, there is no reason to think that all immunity would be lost or that existing vaccines would suddenly fail.", "Im confident current vaccines will be useful for quite a while, he said, noting that the E484K mutation only reduced the neutralization activity of the antibodies present in some peoples blood, and didnt eliminate it for anyone.", "So we need to monitor these mutations, and be prepared to update vaccines eventually if needed, he added.", "But, he said, less effective neutralizing antibodies, while worrying, are not the same as complete elimination of all immunity.", "Indeed, Moderna announced on Jan. 25 that the antibodies collected from people immunized with its vaccine were still able to neutralize a virus with the full set of spike mutations present in the B.1.351 variant, but it took around six times more antibody to do so than for previous versions of the virus.", "The results have not yet been peer reviewed, but were posted in a preprint to bioRxiv in collaboration with researchers at the National Institutes of Health.", "Although in theory the N501Y mutation, by virtue of being located where it is on the spike protein, might also be a concern for immune evasion, experiments thus far have not revealed any problems.", "Blooms lab, for example, did not find that mutations in N501 strongly diminished the ability of any persons antibodies to bind to the virus.", "A similar test on antibodies from 20 people vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine also found no reduction in the ability of those antibodies to neutralize a virus with the N501Y mutation, according to an unpublished report conducted by scientists at the University of Texas in collaboration with Pfizer.", "Public Health England also reported on Jan. 14 that antibodies from people infected with non-B.1.1.7 viruses still neutralized the variant, and vice-versa.", "Other experiments from the vaccine makers likewise suggest B.1.1.7 is unlikely to pose a problem for the current shots.", "As detailed in a report published in the journal Science, Pfizer found that antibodies from people immunized with its vaccine could neutralize a virus with B.1.1.7s full set of spike mutations almost as well as an unmutated virus.", "Moderna reported similar findings for its vaccine on Jan. 25.", "The good news is that should any variant prove to be evading a vaccinated persons immune response, the two COVID-19 vaccines with emergency authorization in the U.S. can be quickly modified.", "Both use messenger RNA to train the immune system to recognize SARS-CoV-2, which can be revised by swapping in a molecule with a slightly different sequence.", "Relatively little is known about the P.1 lineage variant, which a group of scientists first named in a Jan. 12 post on a virology discussion forum.", "Similar to the situation in the U.K. and South Africa, the variant was identified following a surge of COVID-19 cases, this time in Manaus, Brazil.", "Although P.1 arose independently, it shares several genetic changes with the other variants of concern, including N501Y and

group, for an efficacy of 98.2%.", "The trials did not evaluate whether the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but other evidence suggests vaccination does reduce spread of the virus, although it cannot eliminate it.", "It remains unknown how long vaccine protection lasts.", "For some people who are immunocompromised, data suggest that two doses may be insufficient and those individuals might benefit from an additional dose or two.", "For people who are healthy, Moderna conducted an additional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a third booster dose of its vaccine.", "In September 2021, the company announced that giving a half-dose booster results in an increase in neutralizing antibodies, with similar side effects to the second dose.", "The same month, the FDA authorized a booster dose, given at least six months after the initial two-dose series, for the elderly and other populations at increased risk.", "The FDA then expanded booster eligibility to

serious illness in healthy people, although protection against infection or mild illness declined.", "Against omicron, which was first recognized in southern Africa in November 2021, the vaccine is much worse at preventing infection and mild disease.", "It still provides relatively good protection against more serious illness, though, and boosters increase this protection.", "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that during the omicron wave, adults who had received two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines had a 79% lower risk of dying or needing a ventilator if hospitalized with COVID-19, compared with unvaccinated adults.", "Those who had received a booster vaccine dose as well had a 94% lower risk.", "On March 29, 2022, the FDA and CDC began permitting immunocompromised people and those over the age of 50 to get a second mRNA booster, four months or more after the last dose.", "The decision was based largely on data from Israel, which, while limited, suggested improved protection against severe COVID-19 for people 60 years and older after a fourth mRNA shot.", "On Aug. 31, 2022, the FDA authorized omicron-updated boosters, including one from Moderna for people 18 years old and up, two months or more after a previous COVID-19 vaccination.", "For more, see Q&A on Omicron-Updated COVID-19 Boosters.", "No serious safety concerns were reported in the trials.", "As with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, however, vaccine recipients have frequently experienced temporary side effects, including pain at the site of injection, swelling of the lymph nodes in the vaccinated arm, fatigue, headache, muscle or joint pain, and chills.", "According to the FDAs summary, these responses are more likely after the second dose and tend to be more severe in younger adults compared with those 65 years of age or older.", "While scientists say this is a sign that the shots are working as they should, these reactions can be unpleasant.", "Serious adverse events, which refer to potentially life-threatening or disabling events, occurred in 1% of participants in both the vaccine and placebo groups in the phase 3 trial.", "Only three such events were considered by the FDA to be likely due to the vaccine: one case of uncontrollable nausea and vomiting and two cases of facial swelling, both of which occurred in women who had had cosmetic dermal filler injections in the past six months.", "At least a few serious allergic reactions  expected with any vaccine  have been reported with the Moderna vaccine.", "Data presented to the CDC advisory committee showed a rate of 4.9 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses of the Moderna vaccine, as of July 31, 2021, which is slightly higher than 1 to 2 per million instances that occur with other vaccines.", "At this time, the only people the FDA says should not receive the Moderna vaccine are those who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or one of its ingredients.", "The Moderna vaccine has also been linked to an increased risk of rare heart inflammation in young people.", "In late June 2021, the CDCs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices concluded there is a likely association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, or inflammation of the lining around the heart, in teens and young adults.", "Based on data collected through August 2021, the highest reporting rate of either condition in the U.S. following vaccination with the Moderna vaccine was 56.3 cases per million doses, which was in 18- to 24-year-old males.", "That rate was slightly higher than the rate of 52.4 cases per million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.", "Some data indicate that the

pericarditis are higher in males under the age of 40 and are highest in males 18 through 24 years of age.", "Although some reported cases [of vaccine-associated myocarditis/pericarditis] required intensive care support, the FDA summary reads, available data from short-term follow-up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative management.", "The agency also

person no longer has circulating antibodies, theyd still be able to mount a rapid response if they encountered the virus and could likely avoid falling ill.", "It may turn out that people will need to

occurs within 30 minutes after vaccination, the CDC said, adding that vaccine providers have medicines on hand to immediately treat any such reaction.", "To make sure serious allergic reactions can be identified and treated, all people receiving a vaccine should be observed for 15 minutes after getting a shot, the CDC says, and anyone who has experienced anaphylaxis or had any kind of immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection in the past should be monitored for a half hour.", "People who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose or one of the vaccine ingredients

relationship between the J&J vaccine and a few fatal cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome.", "No.", "As Fauci has explained, the unprecedented speed of the COVID-19 vaccines was due to multiple factors, including past investments in mRNA vaccines, and did not require skimping on safety.", "The speed of it is a reflection of the extraordinary scientific advances that have been made in platform technologies for vaccines.", "It was not at the expense of safety, he said.", "In addition, an enormous amount of money  hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars  were put into the development and the production of vaccine doses, so that they would be ready to give to people as soon as the vaccine was shown to be safe and effective.", "As a technology, one of the boons of mRNA vaccines (the design of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines) is their speed  in terms of design, a plausible candidate can be cooked up just knowing the genetic sequence of the virus and an idea of which protein to target.", "In this case, scientists already knew from past experience with SARS and MERS, which are other diseases caused by coronaviruses, that the spike protein the virus uses to enter cells was likely the right one.", "And much of the work had already been done in determining how best to ferry the RNA into cells.", "Although no mRNA vaccine has ever received FDA approval before, this type of vaccine has been studied for years, including in people in some early-phase clinical trials.", "With Johnson & Johnson, the company had experience working with adenovirus-based vaccines, including an Ebola vaccine that gained approval in Europe in July.", "The testing of the vaccines was also sped up by consolidating some of the early testing stages.", "As Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai virologist Florian Krammer has written in the journal Nature, the trials were designed such that clinical phases are overlapping and trial starts are staggered, with initial phase I/II trials followed by rapid progression to phase III trials after interim analysis of the phase I/II data.", "Frequently, these steps are only completed sequentially, largely because companies dont want to proceed with expensive trials until theres a sign that the vaccine will work.", "But with the government taking on the financial risk in many cases, that pressure was removed.", "It is very important to point out that moving forward at financial risk is the main factor that has enabled the accelerated development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, Krammer wrote, and no corners have been or should be cut in terms of safety evaluation.", "The phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trials, which each enrolled upwards of 30,000 people, were also hastened because of the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. With half of people receiving a placebo and the other half getting the vaccine, how long a trial takes is dependent on how rapidly COVID-19 cases accumulate.", "And of course, production capacity was sped along by starting manufacturing even before knowing whether the vaccines would be successful.", "Here, another plus for the mRNA vaccines is that their components are often less time-consuming to produce than traditional vaccines, which require production of protein or virus in cells or eggs.", "Given the threat of the ongoing pandemic, the FDA is expediting its review of COVID-19 vaccines.", "Those authorized so far applied for EUAs rather than the standard full licensure, which is known as a biologics license application, or BLA.", "An EUA typically is a less stringent standard  regulators must determine that the product may be effective and the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks.", "But knowing that a vaccine will go into millions of healthy people, the FDA set up special, more rigorous requirements for a COVID-19 EUA for vaccines that resemble the requirements for a BLA.", "In particular, the FDA required at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccines safety and efficacy in a clear and compelling manner and said it expected vaccine companies to continue to collect data to pursue full FDA-approval.", "The agency also wanted to see at least two months of follow-up data on half or more of the participants.", "Thats less than the minimum of six months thats usually needed for a BLA, but in terms of safety, there is little reason to think more time would uncover any concerns.", "When vaccines cause serious and occasionally fatal adverse events, they invariably occur within six weeks, said Offit, who serves on the FDAs advisory committee.", "Its important to be clear that no vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, and so while large phase 3 clinical trials of the first three authorized vaccines have not revealed any safety concerns, its possible rare adverse events could crop up as the vaccine is moved into millions of people.", "I think you have to be humble and be open-minded to the fact that there may be a serious side effect, said Offit.", "But, as he told JAMA, this is always true when deploying a new vaccine, which is why surveillance systems are in place  and any theoretical risk of a vaccine must be balanced against the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2.", "The choice not to get a vaccine here is not a risk-free choice.", "Its a choice to take a different risk, he said.", "The term safety in the medical world means that the benefits outweigh what are at this point theoretical risks.", "If there is a rare serious adverse event, Offit told us, the good news is that it will be detected rapidly and usually within the first several million doses.", "As we noted, the CDC and FDA have identified 32 cases of a rare blood clotting condition among the more than 10.2 million J&J vaccines administered.", "They recommended a pause in the use of the vaccine on April 13 while they investigated the first six cases identified.", "The CDC and FDA have assembled multiple surveillance systems to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines as they are taken by more and more people.", "Several of these systems draw on participation from the public, and people are encouraged to use them.", "The first is the previously existing Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.", "Experts will comb through the submissions to identify and follow-up on adverse reactions that might be due to the vaccine.", "The CDC is also rolling out a new smartphone-based tool called v-safe for COVID-19 vaccines.", "If you register for the program, you will be asked via text message how you are feeling every day for a week after vaccination and less frequently after that.", "If your answers indicate a potential problem, the system will flag your responses and someone will contact you for more information.", "For the duration of the pandemic, no one should have to pay anything for a COVID-19 vaccine or its administration.", "Karyn Schwartz, a senior fellow with the Kaiser Family Foundation with expertise in health insurance, told FactCheck.org that the vaccines themselves are being provided by government free of charge and there will be no out-of-pocket costs for patients due to various changes to health insurance rules, such as through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act, and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.", "Vaccine providers are allowed to bill insurance companies for administering the vaccine, however, so Schwartz said people should not be alarmed if asked to provide their health insurance information.", "Insurers will be picking up some of the administration costs, she said.", "But it wont be like so much else in health care where you think its covered by your insurance and then its not and you get a bill.", "At some point, the government will stop purchasing doses, and COVID-19 vaccines will likely become like other shots that are covered by insurance  and some of the protections in place will go away, especially if you are uninsured, Schwartz said.", "Unless the law is changed, though, she added, COVID-19 vaccines for Medicare enrollees will always be covered under Part B with no cost-sharing.", "No, at least not to start.", "While there are three vaccines available now and more potentially coming soon, supplies will still be limited for months, and its unlikely you will be able to choose which one you get.", "But if doses become plentiful, Offit said that could change, although he estimated that might not happen until the end of 2021.", "Its possible that in the future, when COVID-19 vaccines are no longer in short supply, that states or certain workplaces might require individuals to be vaccinated.", "As legal and public health expert Joanne Rosen of Johns Hopkins University has explained, the legal precedent for states to make vaccinations compulsory goes back to a 1905 Supreme Court case, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, in which a man challenged an ordinance requiring all adults to be vaccinated against smallpox or to pay a $5 fine.", "The court sided with the state, finding that the smallpox inoculation requirement was a reasonable regulation to protect public health.", "Employers are also allowed to require their workers to get a vaccine, but only if vaccination is reasonably related to a persons job duties.", "That typically includes places such as hospitals or nursing homes, which often require their staff to get flu shots each year.", "The federal government cannot issue a vaccine mandate, Rosen told us, although it can provide financial incentives to nudge states to enact mandates.", "She said she would not be surprised if some workplaces do introduce COVID-19 mandates, but was less confident that states would, at least in the shorter term.", "I dont know if states will enact COVID-19 vaccine mandates or will opt, instead, to strongly encourage people to get vaccinated and roll out public education campaigns, she said.", "For more on this issue, see our Ask SciCheck item Exploring the Legality of COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates.", "Editors note: SciChecks COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.", "The foundation has no control over our editorial decisions, and the views expressed in our articles do not necessarily reflect the views of the foundation.", "The goal of the project is to increase exposure to accurate information about COVID-19 and vaccines, while decreasing the impact of misinformation."], "issues": ["coronavirus", "COVID-19 vaccination"], "image_data": [{"image_src": null, "image_caption": null}], "data": [{"sentence": "Given the limited early supply, the first COVID-19 vaccines are slated primarily for health care workers and nursing home residents.

the risks.", "Early evidence, ACIP said, suggests these myocarditis cases are less severe than typical ones.", "The CDC has also noted that most patients who were treated responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.", "According to an FDA Q&A, the agency has concluded that the safety surveillance data demonstrate increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.", "The agency conducted its own benefit-risk assessment in its approval summary and concluded that even in a worst-case scenario, in which myocarditis and pericarditis cases were more frequent than currently observed, the vaccine was less effective than expected and COVID-19 transmission was low, the benefits of vaccination would outweigh the risks.", "A study from Israel, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Aug. 25, 2021, similarly identified vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as being associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis, at the rate of 2.7 additional cases per 100,000 people.", "But that risk was still much lower than the risk of the same condition in people who contracted the coronavirus, which was at a rate of 11 additional cases per 100,000 people.", "The FDA is requiring Pfizer to conduct six studies to better understand the risk of the inflammatory heart conditions after vaccination.", "The CDC is also conducting its own survey to investigate potential long-term effects.", "The extreme cold is necessary to keep the highly sensitive lipid-encapsulated RNA molecules from degrading.", "Logistically, this cold chain requirement poses an extra hurdle in distributing the vaccine, since many potential vaccination sites lack the appropriate ultracold freezers and may not have a ready source of dry ice.", "Pfizer has tried to mitigate some of these challenges by creating specialized thermal shippers for its vaccine that will maintain ultracold temperatures for up to 10 days if unopened and can store vials for as long as a month if refilled every five days with dry ice.", "On Feb. 25, 2021, the FDA also began allowing the vaccines to be shipped or stored at regular freezer temperatures for up to two weeks, following data showing that the doses would remain stable under such conditions.", "In May 2021, the agency extended the time undiluted vials could be kept in a refrigerator to a month, up from the original five days.", "After changing the buffer to improve stability of the vaccine, the doses can last up to 10 weeks at refrigerator temperatures.", "Rival company Moderna, which also used an mRNA design for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, also requires freezing temperatures, but they are less severe, due to differences in the particular lipid nanoparticles used.", "The company announced in November 2020 that its vaccine should remain stable long-term at standard freezer temperatures and should last for 30 days in a refrigerator.", "Editors
