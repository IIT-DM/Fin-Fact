A few studies have found evidence of some possible damage, but nothing as severe as an immunodeficiency. People on social media, however, are misinterpreting a recent study to incorrectly claim COVID-19 is HIV-like.", "paragraphs": "COVID-19 can be serious and life-threatening. But in many cases, particularly if someone is vaccinated, the disease is mild. While there is a real risk of\u00a0long COVID\u00a0\u2014 lingering or new symptoms after infection with the coronavirus, which can sometimes be debilitating \u2014 most research suggests people who recover do just fine., Studies show that most people who have been infected with the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, are well-protected against severe disease if infected again, with subsequent or prior vaccination offering even more protection.\u00a0, There is no evidence that COVID-19 has left large swaths of the population immunocompromised or unable to fight off either the coronavirus or other pathogens., Yet, as Slate has written, certain corners of the internet have\u00a0misleadingly\u00a0claimed\u00a0that COVID-19 causes widespread immune dysfunction or immunosuppression that is leaving the entire population susceptible to\u00a0all\u00a0sorts\u00a0of subsequent infections. In some cases, COVID-19 has\u00a0incorrectly been likened\u00a0to HIV/AIDS., The latest versions of these\u00a0scaremongering\u00a0claims\u00a0cite a recent paper from a lab at Stanford University and an accompanying\u00a0press release\u00a0from the National Institutes of Health.\u00a0, \u201cNew study (but not news to anyone paying attention) finds that COVID can damage the immune system in similar ways as HIV or Hepatitis,\u201d one Twitter user\u00a0wrote., \u201cWhat more do you want?\u201d another Twitter user\u00a0asked, sharing a screenshot from the press release. He continued: \u201chow many times does it need to be shown? that\u2019s the third study I\u2019ve published TODAY showing this HIV like immune deficiency.\u201d, Both the paper,\u00a0published\u00a0in the journal Immunity, and the news release do include statements that could seem to support some of these interpretations. But the senior author told us the comparison to other viruses had been misunderstood, and the immune defect his group identified is not so severe as an immunodeficiency.\u00a0, Some scientists are skeptical of the results, and say the study is an outlier., \u201c[T]here\u2019s really no evidence \u2026 that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes long term immune damage similar to HIV or HCV,\u201d\u00a0E. John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told us in an email, referring to hepatitis C virus. \u201cThese claims are not based on solid data \u2013 either rigorous immunological assessment or real world manifestation of increases in other infections or diseases related to immune suppression.\u201d, The Immunity\u00a0paper, which was published on March 15 and authored by\u00a0Mark M. Davis\u2019 lab at Stanford, analyzed T cells found in the blood of people after COVID-19 vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 infection or both., T cells are one arm of the adaptive immune system. One subset, known as CD4 T cells, helps B cells make antibodies and helps coordinate the immune response. Another subset, known as CD8 T cells, kills infected cells to limit the spread of viruses., Using a highly sensitive method to fish out coronavirus-specific T cells from hundreds of blood samples collected at multiple time points, the authors found that compared with people who had been vaccinated, people who had been infected had significantly reduced CD8 T cell responses against the coronavirus. Vaccination after an infection helped, but the CD8 T cell response was still much lower than in those who had never been infected., \u201cThis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 virus infection may cause long-term damage to the patients\u2019 immune system well after viral clearance,\u201d the authors wrote., In their discussion, the authors made a comparison to infection with HIV and hepatitis C virus, noting that reduced CD8 T cell function has been\u00a0observed\u00a0in patients as long as a year after those viruses were either fully or nearly eliminated. This comparison was then highlighted in an NIH press release, which people on social media then quoted to lend credence to the false idea that COVID-19 is HIV-like., But the authors\u2019 comparison is specific to a particular phenomenon with those viruses and their effects on CD8 T cells after total or near-total viral clearance. It doesn\u2019t mean COVID-19 causes an immunodeficiency on par with HIV, which permanently\u00a0damages the immune system\u00a0by killing off a person\u2019s CD4 T cells., \u201cThe damage we cited in our paper was more subtle,\u201d Davis told us \u2014 \u201cnot on the same scale as the CD4 wipeout for HIV.\u201d, In fact, the Stanford group found no noticeable differences in the CD4 T cells from people who had been infected versus not., As\u00a0Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, told us, the \u201cimmune effects of Covid are nothing like HIV at all.\u201d, While the comparison was misunderstood, some scientists criticized the authors for making it. , \u201cThe scale of the defect in HIV and HCV is so much greater that I think anything that\u2019s being reported here \u2014 even if we take it at face value \u2014 that I think that was a \u2026 risky analogy to make,\u201d\u00a0Paul G. Thomas, an immunologist at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said in a phone interview. \u201cI think that\u2019s caused a lot of alarm and a lot of frantic press speculation that\u2019s really not warranted.\u201d, A few scientists we spoke with were also doubtful of the Immunity paper\u2019s results and critical of how the group interpreted its findings., Thomas, who\u00a0published\u00a0a paper in Nature Immunology in April 2022 that did not find any CD8 T cell defects, emphasized that the Stanford paper is just one of many other studies from groups using a variety of techniques that have come to opposite conclusions., \u201cIt\u2019s not particularly representative of what many, many other studies have found, which have suggested that if you had a mild to moderate COVID infection, you\u2019ve recovered, you don\u2019t have long COVID,\u201d he said, \u201cthen you should not be worrying about anything.\u201d, Wherry, the Penn immunologist, said the Immunity paper was \u201cdefinitely an outlier.\u201d, \u201cMost if not all other studies that have examined this issue carefully find the opposite or fail to come to the same conclusion. In fact, for what they specifically examined: infection followed by vaccination \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of data that this \u2018hybrid immunity\u2019 is good,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cMoreover, these individuals are not more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 or anything else for that matter. There\u2019s no evidence of immune system damage.\u201d, In most cases, Thomas explained, people with a mild to moderate COVID infection mount a standard immune response, and generate good immunological memory to the virus, similar to what happens with influenza. Vaccination on top of infection typically boosts \u201csome aspects of that memory response,\u201d he said., There are exceptions when there are problems with the immune system. People who have had very severe COVID-19 do sometimes have very low counts of T and B cells, for example. And with long COVID, there could be other immune problems, although those still wouldn\u2019t be considered a full immunodeficiency., \u201cIn long COVID there is likely some immune perturbation,\u201d Wherry said, \u201cbut exactly how that works has not been clearly defined yet.\u201d, Several possibilities might explain the Stanford group\u2019s results, Thomas said, including the chance sampling of an outlier group of people, or the methods that the lab used. The lab used a unique approach for identifying the specific T cells., Thomas also said that based on what was written about the methods, it seemed patients were drawn from different studies, so it\u2019s possible the blood samples might have been processed in slightly different ways., The authors themselves note in the paper that, as is true with other similar studies, it\u2019s impossible to capture the full range of T cells that recognize the coronavirus, and their analysis was limited to the cells circulating in the blood. If more virus-specific CD8 T cells stayed localized in tissues after infection compared with vaccination, that would affect the results., Wherry said he had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about some of the lab\u2019s methods, which include a technique not used by others in the field. He also thought the paper\u2019s stated conclusions were \u201can over interpretation of what the data in the paper show.\u201d, \u201cBottom line,\u201d he said, \u201cis that others don\u2019t see this.\u201d, Davis, however, defended his work., \u201cThe other studies were one-tenth the sensitivity of our study,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t completely explain why they didn\u2019t see this, but we saw what we saw, and it would be irresponsible if we didn\u2019t publish it.\u201d, Davis said he thinks his results \u201creflect some kind of long-term damage,\u201d which might relate to long COVID. It is not yet clear what this entails or how it would manifest, he said, but one idea is that people could have a harder time recovering after a reinfection., While his paper suggested that the damage could apply to other infections, Davis said he thinks it\u2019s likely to be specific to the coronavirus. That mention was included, he said, because the authors couldn\u2019t rule out a broader effect, since they hadn\u2019t tested for that yet. The data in his paper, however, only show a diminished response from CD8 T cells that recognize SARS-CoV-2., Davis said the main message for the public should not be fear, but to get vaccinated, since vaccination helped improve the impaired CD8 T cell response following infection. But he said he hopes scientists are spurred to investigate the phenomenon further.\u00a0, \u201cI think everybody\u2019s got to look at this and dig deeper and see what this might mean,\u201d he said., Other scientists weren\u2019t as critical of the Immunity paper. Altmann, of Imperial College London, said in an email that the study was from \u201ca superb and reliable lab, and their answers stand.\u201d He added that the work is \u201csomewhat similar\u201d to another paper\u00a0published\u00a0in January 2022 in Nature Immunology, which identified immune system differences the authors termed \u201cimmunological dysfunction\u201d eight months after mild-to-moderate infection., However, Altmann noted that other \u201cequally excellent research,\u201d\u00a0published\u00a0in Nature in January, came to the opposite conclusion, finding that males who had recovered from mild COVID-19 actually had better responses to a flu vaccine than those who never had COVID-19., He cautioned against reading too much into any single dataset, particularly when research on COVID-19 has quickly outstripped that of any other disease., Regardless, scientists said it was incorrect to conclude from the Immunity paper or anything else that COVID-19 causes something as extreme as an immune deficiency., \u201c[T]here are some nuanced differences for some T cell markers in some studies, but this [isn\u2019t] remotely the same as immune compromise and currently, unlinked to any phenotype,\u201d Altmann said, referring to any observable effect., Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s articles correcting health misinformation are made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
