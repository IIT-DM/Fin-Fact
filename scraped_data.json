{"title": "No Evidence Excess Deaths Linked to Vaccines, Contrary to Claims Online ", "author": "Kate Yandell", "posted": "Posted on April 17, 2023", "sci_digest": "COVID-19 vaccines substantially reduce the risk of dying from COVID-19, and serious side effects are very rare. Excess deaths among working-age adults in 2021 and 2022 were driven by COVID-19 and other factors, not vaccination. Faulty logic underlies claims that vaccines caused mass disability and economic harm.", "paragraphs": "COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of death from the disease,\u00a0including\u00a0in young adults., Despite overwhelming evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have mitigated the effects of the pandemic, a report called the\u00a0Vaccine Damage Project, or V-Damage Project, claims that they led to 310,000 excess deaths among Americans ages 25 through 64\u00a0in 2021 and 2022.\u00a0It also baselessly claims the\u00a0vaccines had a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on the number of Americans with disabilities and that COVID-19 vaccines were the \u201cmost likely cause\u201d for a large increase in work absences., The report,\u00a0which uses the faulty estimates of excess deaths, disabilities and injuries to calculate\u00a0economic damages,\u00a0appears on the website of Phinance Technologies \u2014\u00a0a firm that\u00a0offers subscriptions to\u00a0financial reports and consulting services. Phinance\u00a0says it plans to launch an investment fund. , The alleged findings of the V-Damage Project have been shared widely on social media. Edward Dowd, a founding partner of Phinance Technologies, baselessly tweeted that the \u201cestimated human cost\u201d of the vaccines was 26.6 million injuries, 1.36 million disabilities and 300,000 excess deaths. Dowd has repeatedly said that COVID-19 vaccines are causing large numbers of deaths, claims that have been debunked by other fact-checkers., Excess deaths associated with the pandemic\u00a0did continue\u00a0in 2021 and 2022, but there is no evidence COVID-19 vaccines caused this phenomenon. COVID-19\u00a0continued\u00a0to kill hundreds of thousands of American adults, including nearly 200,000 under age 65 during those two years., Deaths due to drug overdoses, motor vehicle accidents and alcohol also\u00a0rose\u00a0in adults ages 25 to 44 in 2020 and again in 2021, according to\u00a0Ellen Meara, a professor of health economics and policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. (She told us in an email that the available data don\u2019t yet provide a complete picture of 2022.)\u00a0, \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines are the best tool to prevent and reduce complications due to COVID-19,\u201d Lisa George, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention public affairs specialist, told us in an email. \u201cThese vaccines are safe and effective and have undergone the most extensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.\u201d, The number of Americans with\u00a0disabilities\u00a0also\u00a0increased\u00a0in 2021 and 2022, but negative effects from vaccines are unlikely to explain this rise, given the vaccines\u2019 good\u00a0safety profile. Finally, sickness-related workplace absences began to\u00a0rise\u00a0in 2020, before vaccines were available. A\u00a0spike\u00a0in absences in early 2022 coincided with the omicron wave., Since\u00a0early\u00a0in the pandemic, the CDC has been tallying\u00a0excess deaths \u2014 a measure that compares the number of expected deaths in a time period to the actual number of deaths that occur., The CDC calculates expected deaths assuming the pandemic had not happened, although it notes that \u201cit is increasingly difficult to predict what trends in mortality would have looked like had the pandemic not occurred.\u201d, There have been more than 1.3 million excess deaths in the U.S. since Feb. 1, 2020, according to CDC\u2019s calculation. Many of these are known to be directly the result of COVID-19. Other deaths, the agency explains, could \u201crepresent misclassified COVID-19 deaths, or potentially could be indirectly related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d These could include, for example, deaths occurring because of overburdened hospitals, or because of upticks in car crashes or drug overdoses. Especially early in the pandemic, many COVID-19 deaths were missed because of a lack of testing., According to CDC data, there have been more than 300,000 excess deaths\u00a0since the beginning of the pandemic\u00a0if those listing COVID-19 as a cause are excluded. Again, some of these deaths could still be due to COVID-19, but the disease was not listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death., The V-Damage Project\u00a0calculates\u00a0excess deaths due to vaccination using faulty logic., The report first reasonably states that it\u2019s difficult to distinguish causes of death at the population level. It goes on to incorrectly say: \u201cStarting in the summer of 2021, however, with the introduction of mass vaccinations, the rise in natural immunity by exposure to the virus, and the emergence of milder and more contagious virus strains such as Omicron, it is difficult to argue if Covid-19 had a significant role in excess mortality. Therefore, we can use the total excess mortality in 2021 and 2022 as an estimate for vaccine-related deaths, or at least an estimated upper limit for the vaccine damage.\u201d, There are several things wrong with this statement. First, a substantial number of people\u00a0died from COVID-19\u00a0in the second half of 2021 and in 2022. By the start of summer 2021, there had been a little more than 600,000 COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. The death toll had risen to nearly 1.1 million by the end of 2022. And while the proportion of COVID-19 deaths in older versus younger adults increased over this time period, COVID-19\u00a0continued\u00a0to kill people under age 65., As noted in a HealthFeedback article discussing a prior claim from Dowd about excess deaths, the timing of excess deaths during the pandemic indicates they are closely tied to COVID-19 deaths, not vaccination. An\u00a0article\u00a0from the Associated Press further notes that to show a relationship between vaccines and deaths, one would need to show that vaccinated people \u2014 and not unvaccinated people \u2014 died at elevated rates. The V-Damage Project doesn\u2019t provide information on deaths in vaccinated versus unvaccinated people., Second, omicron has been\u00a0far from benign. Research shows that per infection, omicron has been less severe than earlier variants, in large part because more people have some immunity, either from infection, vaccination or both. There is also some evidence that omicron is naturally less virulent than the delta variant that directly preceded it, although omicron appears to be about as virulent as the original virus., But omicron\u00a0spreads more readily\u00a0to close contacts than delta, and vaccination is less effective at blocking transmission. This all added up to a\u00a0record-breaking\u00a0wave of COVID-19 cases in late 2021 and early 2022, which came with significant\u00a0deaths., Third, the effects of the pandemic have been complex, and excess deaths related to the pandemic likely have multiple causes. Deaths due to drug overdoses, cardiometabolic disorders and other diseases were\u00a0already increasing\u00a0in\u00a0younger Americans\u00a0in the decade leading up to the pandemic. The pandemic \u201caccentuated the pre-existing mid-life mortality crisis\u201d in the U.S., researchers wrote in a 2022\u00a0study\u00a0published in Nature Human Behavior.\u00a0, As we\u2019ve mentioned, deaths due to drug overdoses, alcohol and motor vehicle accidents all\u00a0increased\u00a0in young adults in the U.S. in 2020 and 2021. A recent CDC report also shows an increase in suicides in 2021, including in young adult males., Finally, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have killed large numbers of people. The Food and Drug Administration and CDC have\u00a0multiple systems\u00a0for monitoring vaccine safety, and they have detected\u00a0very few deaths\u00a0caused by the vaccines. , According to a CDC\u00a0web page\u00a0updated last month, nine deaths have been linked to a rare clotting disorder caused by the\u00a0Johnson and Johnson\u00a0vaccine. \u201cCDC and FDA continue to review reports of death following COVID-19 vaccination and update information as it becomes available,\u201d the web page says., In fact, the evidence shows that the vaccines have saved lives. Meara pointed to a paper\u00a0published in the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association that compared death rates in June 2021 through March 2022 in the 10 states with the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates with the primary series versus the 10 states with the lowest rates. Per 100,000 people, there were 75 COVID-19 deaths in the most vaccinated states versus 146 in the least vaccinated states. Excess deaths from all causes were also lower in states with a high proportion of vaccinated individuals., It is unlikely that serious and severe adverse events from COVID-19 vaccines led to rising numbers of people with disabilities in 2021 and 2022, contrary to\u00a0claims\u00a0in the V-Damage report.\u00a0, The Bureau of Labor Statistics regularly carries out a nationally representative survey, called the Current Population Survey, of around 60,000 U.S. households. The survey data do show an\u00a0increase\u00a0in people reporting\u00a0disabilities\u00a0in 2021 and 2022., But Sean Smith, an economist with the Current Population Survey at the BLS, told us in an email that the survey data cannot be used to identify specific disabilities. \u201cWe cannot determine from the questions asked if the disability is related to COVID or to an adverse reaction to a vaccine,\u201d he said., A November 2022\u00a0working paper\u00a0from the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research pointed out that, beginning in the second quarter of 2021, the initial rise in the disability rate likely occurred because some people missed earlier interviews and were asked questions about disability in subsequent surveys. \u201cHowever, since then the rising prevalence of Long COVID and other new sources of disability signal that the increase may reflect an actual increase in the number of [people with disability],\u201d the researchers wrote., There is extensive data available on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines, and these data indicate it is unlikely that they caused a significant number of disabilities. The\u00a0vast majority\u00a0of side effects following vaccination \u2014 like fever and pain at the injection site \u2014 are temporary and are not serious., The V-Damage Report also\u00a0relies\u00a0on a\u00a0paper\u00a0written by emergency medicine physician Dr. Joseph Fraiman and colleagues to argue that vaccine damages led to the rise in disabilities. As we\u2019ve\u00a0previously explained, the paper makes an unsubstantiated claim about adverse events based on a flawed reanalysis of the clinical trials of the\u00a0Pfizer/BioNTech\u00a0and\u00a0Moderna\u00a0mRNA vaccines.\u00a0, In reality, serious adverse events were uncommon in large, randomized mRNA vaccine trials and occurred at a similar rate among people who got the vaccines and those who got the placebos., Finally, the V-Damage report makes\u00a0unsubstantiated claims\u00a0that data from\u00a0v-safe\u00a0\u2014 a text messaging-based system that prompts people to report on their health after vaccination \u2014 show a concerning pattern of hospitalization. \u201cOur analysis shows that during the vaccine rollout process, the CDC had live real world data that corroborated the safety signals observed in the clinical trials,\u201d the report says., In fact, a 2022\u00a0analysis\u00a0of data from v-safe and another vaccine monitoring system called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System showed that most reported adverse events from mRNA vaccines during the first six months of the vaccination program were \u201cmild and short in duration.\u201d, As we\u2019ve previously\u00a0explained, less than 1% of people enrolled in v-safe sought medical care in the week after each vaccine dose. An even smaller number, less than 0.1%, were hospitalized in the week after receiving each dose. Further, v-safe prompts participants to report any health event or hospitalization, not just ones they believe are related to vaccination. Similarly, VAERS accepts reports of any post-vaccination event, regardless of the cause., Many people take time off from work temporarily due to minor side effects from COVID-19 vaccines, but these absences do not explain a larger pattern of increasing absences since 2020., The V-Damage Project uses data on side effects from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to\u00a0claim\u00a0that full-time workers experienced injuries from COVID-19 vaccines and that the vaccines caused \u201ca degradation of individuals\u2019 immune systems.\u201d But as we\u2019ve noted, very few side effects were serious or lasting, and there is no evidence the vaccines harm the immune system. , The report goes on to cite data from the BLS to claim that these vaccine \u201cinjuries\u201d led to absences from work. But work absences due to \u201cown illness, injury, or medical problems\u201d\u00a0increased\u00a0at the start of the pandemic, according to Smith, the BLS economist. When counting absences that lasted the entire week, absences due to sickness reached 1.3 million in March 2020 and 2 million in April 2020 \u2014 then a record-high number., The V-Damage Project\u00a0acknowledges\u00a0this early-pandemic increase \u2014 prior to the arrival of vaccines \u2014 but says that the \u201clargest rise in absence rates was in 2022\u201d and that this \u201coccurred after the main impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d, However, the unusually large number of sickness-related absences in 2022 can be attributed to a spike at the beginning of the year. , Sickness-related absences \u201cfurther increased to a series high of 3.6 million in January 2022, however this measure dropped to 1.6 million in February 2022 and since then has been similar to the average levels seen in 2020 and 2021,\u201d Smith told us in an email., As before with disabilities, Smith said that BLS does not have information on the type of illness that caused people to miss work., But it is worth noting that omicron cases peaked in the U.S. in early 2022, breaking prior records for weekly COVID-19 cases. The BLS\u00a0data\u00a0on absences appear more closely tied to COVID-19\u00a0cases\u00a0than\u00a0vaccinations., Emma Xiaolu Zang, an assistant professor of sociology at Yale University, who has done research on illness-related work absences early in the pandemic, told us via email that absences in 2022 were likely part of a longer-term pattern of COVID-19-related absences. , \u201cCOVID vaccines were unlikely to be the reason for the spike in [sickness-related absences], which started in early 2020,\u201d Zang said., Editor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s articles providing accurate health information and correcting health misinformation are made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
