the rankings of these cities each year from 2010 through 2018 shows that San Antonio is low on the list, followed by El Paso.", "Another way to assess income in a community is to look at median household income or median family income.", "Median household income includes the income of the householder and anyone else living in the home over 15 years old.", "This figure is different than median family income, according to the Census Bureau: Because many households consist of only one person, average household income is usually less than average family income.", "Median family income looks at incomes of all members 15 years old and over related to the householder.", "In 2018, the median household income in San Antonio was $49,024, lower than all of the six most populous Texas cities besides El Paso ($45,031).", "San Antonios median family income was $60,689 in 2018, a higher figure than Dallas ($58,835), Houston ($56,693) and El Paso ($50,245).", "Poverty in San Antonio Cisneros made this claim after stating that San Antonio is a poor city, so we also looked at poverty data available from the Census Bureau for the 10 most populous cities in the state.", "In 2018 in San Antonio, about 19% of its population was living below the poverty line  more than any of the other cities with populations over 500,000.", "Take at look at each city and the percent of its population below the poverty line, ordered from highest to lowest: Another factor worth mentioning here is cost of living.", "San Antonio may be among the cities with the lowest per capita income, but the cost of living is also on the lower end.", "The Economic Policy Institutes Family Budget Map shows an estimated cost of living for a two-parent, two-child family in counties across the state.", "Here is the cost of living per year in the predominate county in each city with a population over 500,000, in order from highest to lowest: Our ruling Cisneros said that San Antonio has the lowest

further behind when compared to a sampling of Rhode Island's wealthiest.", "Rhode Island's minimum wage workers fare amongst the worst in the country in this regard.", "Our ruling Rhode Island AFL-CIO

exclusively, or even primarily, to a mayor?", "No -- many factors play into a citys economic success.", "The mayor of Detroit doesnt have much power over the international market for automobiles, and no mayor of New York can take all the credit for the economic juggernaut of Wall Street.", "While mayoral policies may have an effect on the margins, such factors as the state and national business cycle, broad demographic patterns and international business trends tend to have a much greater impact on economic inequality in cities.", "In addition, its worth remembering that cities attract people on the basis of many factors, of which the party of their political leaders is probably a minor one, said William Frey, a senior fellow in Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program.", "Inequality patterns in cities may be at least as much about population size and geographic patterns as they are about partisan leadership.", "Focusing on the partisan differences obscures a more fundamental

contain many suburban areas or are, in effect, suburbs themselves, Kolko said.", "Such cities tend to have more modest income ranges.", "Why does all this matter?", "It undercuts the notion that partisan leadership has much to do with why certain cities become relatively unequal and certain become relatively equal.", "Causation may actually run the opposite way.", "Its always important to remember that correlation does not necessarily mean causation.", "In this context, its not necessarily that Republican leadership creates greater equality, as Pauls comment presumes.", "Rather, it could be that greater equality prompts people to vote Republican.Or it could be unrelated.", "I think it runs more in the direction that inequality provides conditions for Democratic success, rather than Democrats causing inequality, said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who specializes in electoral patterns and geography.", "And any explanation other than political

You were in the Assembly then, Kyrillos said, adding that you look at things in the context of their times. You look at the legislation as its proposed.Lets refresh Kyrillos memory here, because PolitiFact New Jersey didnt have to go back to the 1980s to find a time when he voted against increasing the minimum wage.Kyrillos, a state senator from Monmouth County, voted against a 2005 proposal that boosted the minimum wage in two steps, eventually increasing it to $7.15 per hour in 2006.That rate didnt change until 2009, when the federal minimum wage jumped to $7.25 per hour. When federal and state minimum wages conflict, the higher one applies, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.When we pointed out the 2005 vote to Kyrillos spokeswoman Meaghan Cronin she said Kyrillos has supported increasing the minimum wage and cited another 2005 bill that he sponsored.Two weeks after Kyrillos voted against the proposal that became law he introduced legislation that increased the minimum wage more, but at a slower pace. Under his bill, the minimum wage would increase in four stages, reaching $7.25 per hour on Aug. 1, 2008.That bill was referred to committee but never came to a vote.Still, Kyrillos is wrong to claim his vote against the minimum wage happened more than two decades ago, because he voted against it again less than 10 years ago.In fact, Kyrillos wasnt even in office for much of the 1980s. He joined the Assembly in 1988 before winning a seat in the state Senate, where he has served since 1992.Then-assemblyman Kyrillos voted against a 1990 bill that hiked the minimum wage -- then set at $3.35 per hour -- in three phases, ultimately increasing it to an hourly rate of $5.05 in 1992.Menendez, who also served in the assembly at the time, voted in favor of the bill, according to assembly minutes.The assembly later voted again on the same measure after the senate amended the bill. On that second vote, Menendez again voted yes, while Kyrillos is not listed in the minutes as voting.By 1992 both Kyrillos and Menendez had joined the state senate. That year a bill was introduced to delay half of the final increase in the minimum wage hike approved two years earlier.Kyrillos voted in favor of that legislation, while Menendez opposed it. The governor vetoed the bill.Our rulingKyrillos said, when I voted against [an increase in the minimum wage], it was in the 80s.Actually the state senator and Republican U.S. Senate hopeful voted against a bill in 2005 that eventually increased the minimum wage to $7.15 per hour.We rate this statement False.To comment on this ruling, go toNJ.com.", "hrefs": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/10/joe_kyrillos_minimum_wage_mene.html"}], "label": "false"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/oct/03/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-state-income-tax-jumped-2-perc/", "title": "The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent.", "author": "Erin O'Neill", "posted": "10/03/2012", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["Whet the appetite of liberal politicians with a new tax and Gov.", "Chris Christie warns theyll become ravenous.Thats why Christie told a crowd in New Hampshire they should vote on Nov. 6 for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State.", "Otherwise New Hampshire, which doesnt tax wages, may go the way of New Jersey.Christie said 35 years ago New Jersey also didnt have an income tax, but then Governor Brendan Byrne, a Democrat, said if you just give me a small income tax, just a little one, I will lower your property taxes, for the people who have the highest property taxes in America back in 1977.", "So 35 years later, what have we got?", "We still have the highest property taxes in America and the income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent -- 9 percent.Here's the key everybody: you let a liberal politician in the door and give them permission to give you a new tax, they only know one direction for that tax to go and that's up, Christie said at the Sept. 25 event.Did New Jerseys income tax more than quadruple since it was first enacted, as Christie said?The governors statement is partially accurate because a group of individuals -- those earning more than $500,000 in taxable income -- are now subject to a statutory income tax rate of 8.97 percent.But those individuals represent only a small percentage of filers in New Jersey and the tax rates are lower for other income levels.The governors office did not respond to requests for comment, but the history of the states income tax is clear.In 1976 -- during Byrnes first term -- the state passed a temporary income tax with two rates.A 2 percent rate was levied on income less than $20,000 or about $80,000 in todays dollars, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.Income in excess of $20,000 was taxed at the top rate of 2.5 percent.A year after the temporary tax was enacted, the state made it permanent.Over time New Jersey modeled its income tax into a more progressive system, which now has rates ranging from 1.4 percent to 8.97 percent depending on income level and filing status.The states top rate is 8.97 percent, which only applies to income in excess of $500,000.", "Less than 2 percent of taxable New Jersey resident returns in 2009 had that level of income, according to state Treasury Department data.An individual with taxable income between $75,000 and $500,000 pays a 6.37 percent rate on that income.", "For income between $40,000 and $75,000, the rate is about 5.5 percent.The lowest rates are 1.4 percent and 1.75 percent, which are lower than the states rates in 1976.", "Those rates apply to incomes below $20,000 or between $20,000 and $35,000, respectively.So for Christie to suggest the income tax, in general, jumped from 2 percent to 9 percent is misleading.", "Thats true for one income level, but the statement oversimplifies New Jerseys current income tax system.Our rulingChristie said, The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent.When the state first implemented an income tax in 1976, two rates existed -- 2 percent for income less than $20,000 and 2.5 percent for income more than $20,000 -- but the state has since introduced a more progressive tax system.New Jerseys top rate is nearly 9 percent now, but applies only to taxable income above $500,000.Every other income bracket is subject to a rate lower than 9 percent, with some income levels charged a rate of less than 2 percent.We rate this statement Half True.To comment on this ruling, go toNJ.com."], "issues": ["New Jersey", "Income", "Taxes"], "image_data": [], "data": [{"sentence": "Whet the appetite of liberal politicians with a new tax and Gov.

Still, the NWLC statement about all 50 states seemed broad. Was there the possibility that in at least one state the wage gap either didnt exist or favored women? And what factors were considered to determine the gap?The two most common sources for this type of gender wage data are the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. NWLC used data from the Census Bureaus 2011 American Community Survey, released last month, to calculate wage gaps in each of the 50 states and Washington, D.C.Using the Community Surveys statistics, the NWLC calculated the wage gap for each state as the ratio of female and male median earnings for full-time, year-round workers. (The Community Survey classified full-time, year-round workers as those being 16 years old and over and who usually worked 35 hours or more per week.) The wage gaps are presented as the number of cents women are paid for every dollar paid to their male counterparts. Using this methodology, the organizations statement is accurate.For example, Georgia ranked 13th out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C., in order of the highest wage gaps by jurisdiction. In Georgia, the wage gap was 80.7 percent, meaning that for every dollar a man earned, women earned just under 81 cents. Georgia males earned $43,902 and women earned $35,438 annually, a difference of $8,464.In that ranking, Washington, D.C., fared the best, with women making about 90 cents for every dollar men make. In Wyoming, where the wage gap was the largest, women earned 66.6 cents for each dollar earned by men.The NWLC analysis also includes the often-used statistic that the national gender wage gap is 77 percent, or more clearly: For every dollar a man earns, a woman earns 77 cents. The national wage gap calculated by the organization is based oncensus datathat  tracks full-time, year-round worker wages regardless of occupation.PolitiFact has examinedwage disparityclaimswith varying outcomes. Supporters of wage gap legislation typically cite the 77-cent figure without clarifying that the gap does not take into account other factors that could influence the figure, including occupation, employment longevity and education. The census data shows the widest gap, but other data, including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for example, yields smaller differences. UsingBLS data, women are paid 86 percent of the median hourly wages of men.So, does the NWLCs claim hold up? Based on Census Bureau data, it does appear that women are paid less than men in every state and Washington, D.C.

Last year, Sentier initiated a new statistic based on U.S. Census Bureau data -- a household income index that tracks upticks and downticks in median income and reports it monthly.What did Sentier find?In January 2009, the month Obama took office, median household income was $54,893. In June 2012, it was $50,881, a drop of almost $4,000. (We used inflation-adjusted figures from a spreadsheet provided to us by Sentier.

This census survey reaches approximately 50,000 households and 130,000 household members each month, asking a variety of questions, including the sum of income earned by household members during the previous 12 months.Thats very similar to how the census produces its report called the Current Population Survey -- Annual Social and Economic Supplements. That survey also asks households about income, but over a given calendar year. The census Current Population Survey was just released for 2011. The median income: $50,054.Green told us the comparable figure in his work is Sentiers January 2012 index because it asked respondents about their income for the previous 12 months. In that case, those months are calendar year 2011. Sentiers median income for that period: $50,020, a difference of just $34. That would indicate that Sentier's methodology produces a number very close to the official census number.Sentiers index is a new measuring stick, and not time-tested, but Green and Coder are both retired from the census, and their work has been widely cited in the media.The Census Bureau is the source of official statistics, Green said.

In addition, we ruled that governors have only marginal impact on their states economies.In his Janesville address, Ryan tossed the Obama and Romney records into one claim.Thats a claim-changer, because the numbers are apples and oranges.The declining incomes Ryan cites in the last four years were in real dollars -- inflation adjusted to show the true effect on purchasing power -- while the gains in household income under Romney were not inflation-adjusted.Applying the real dollar analysis to the income trend under Romney, there was a drop in Massachusetts household incomes, not a $5,000 bump up, a Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation researchertoldPolitiFactin June.This week we asked Gary Burtless, a former U.S. Labor Department economist with the Brookings Institution, to check that. He found a $589 drop, about 1 percent, compared to a nationwide increase of 1.4 percent.Theres nothing wrong with using unadjusted dollars, but economists we consulted said using real dollars is a better real-world way of gauging income trends.And by mixing the two methods, Ryan creates a much larger gap between the 2003-2007 experience and the 2009-2012 numbers.It's definitely not kosher to use inflation-adjusted numbers in one case and nominal numbers in the other case, Daniel Mitchell, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us. When inflation is high enough to wipe away nominal gains in income, as in the Massachusetts example, that makes it even more important to use apples-to-apples comparisons, he added.Recession roleRyan talked about a decline in median household income in the last four years.That would reach back to mid-2008 near the end of the Republican administration of George W. Bush. TheGreat Recessionbeganduring the Bush era, in December 2007.Lets look back four years, using the Sentier Research study, which was the source used in a now-outdatedBloombergNewsstory that Ryans campaign cites to back up his claim of a $4,000 drop. (Though census data income data is the gold standard for these statistics, it has not been released for 2011 or 2012).The Sentier data, current through June 2012, shows a $3,317 drop in median household income since June 2008. Thats a 6 percent dip.Ryan said the decline was an average of $4,000, so hes off going back four years.But if you assume Ryan was informally using four years as a proxy for Obamas term so far, its a $4,019 drop.Our ratingRyan said in a convention send-off speech that Obama deserves blame for household incomes nationally tumbling $4,000, while Romney deserves credit for incomes growing a substantial $5,000 in Massachusetts when Romney governed that state.Earlier in the campaign, when Romney made these two claims separately, we found them partially accurate.But when they are combined, they leave a false impression of polar-opposite trend lines because one is adjusted for inflation, while the other is not.Applying the same inflation-adjusted methodology that Ryan chose to show the $4,000 household income drop under Obama, median incomes actually fell $589 under Romney during his earlier stint as governor.Ryan also affixes too much blame or credit on the pair for the trends.We rate this statement False.", "hrefs": "http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/PaulRyanR"}], "label": "false"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/aug/19/marty-beil/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-gave-raises-working-pri/", "title": "Says Gov.

We dont want you no more, she sang, asking those in attendance to join a Hit the road, Scott refrain.A video of the song made its way toYouTube(You knew it would, didnt you?), so anyone could listen to Moores verbal walloping of Walker (My therapist said you cant internalize the pain).Moore closed with a line about Walkers budget having raised taxes on the poor and the elderly by gutting the Earned Income and Homestead Tax Credits.What were you thinkin baby? Moore said.Moore and her swaying backup singers -- among them lobbyist Gary Goyke and former Democratic state Rep. Peter Bock, who is married to gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Falk -- seemed a bit, um, out of sync.But what about the claim of gutting tax credits that benefit the poor and elderly?Did Moore hit the right notes on that one?It was a humorous bit, but it contained a serious claim. And when we spot political humor, we always look for a chance to, well, drain all the humor from it and write a technical piece about the ins and outs of tax policy.So with apologies to the songs writer, Percy Mayfield, and Ray Charles, who made it famous, here we go:On theWalk-O-Meter, weve already noted that Walkers 2011-13 budget raised taxes on lower and moderate income working families and others by cutting back the statesEarned Income Tax Creditand the separateHomestead Credit. We gave Walker aPromise Broken, since he had pledged to oppose all tax increases.But did the cuts amount to a gutting of the credits?Asked for backup, Moores office pointed us to March 6, 2011Wisconsin State Journal articleheadlined, Walker budget slashes tax credits that aid poor.That certainly suggests a gutting.But we ran the numbers ourselves, with much help from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, tax experts and the state Department of Revenue.Homestead CreditThis credit gives renters and homeowners a state income tax break if their incomes and property taxes or rent are low enough to qualify.

year in sustained economic growth.For every percent we move up, it means economic activity growing the next year and for each year thereafter (by) $2.5 billion dollars, he said.While the correlation between education levels and higher wages for individuals is fairly well-established, we were struck by the specific price tag Petro was able to put on Ohioans getting their sheepskins.", "So PolitiFact Ohio checked it out.Spencer Waugh, a policy liaison for the Ohio Board of Regents, sent us three documents to corroborate Petros claim.", "In an e-mail, Waugh said Petros estimate of $2.5 billion is fair and conservative given that some studies show less and at least one study shows more.The first document was a memo from Waugh to Petro which claimed that a 1 percent jump in Ohioans with bachelors degrees would net an income increase of $1.09 billion.", "Waughs memo multiples the number of new Ohioans with bachelors degrees by $19,000 a year  a figure he says represents the annual gain for those going from holding a high school diploma to a bachelors degree.Waughs figures were based on a data from the National Center for Education Statistics as well as 2007 census data, according to Kim Norris, Petros communications director.The 2007 census data states that the gap is $20,000 per year for adults.", "The National Center for Education Statistics data shows the gap at $18,000 for males but only $15,000 for females in the age group of 25-34.", "So $19,000 is in the ballpark.Using the $19,000 multiplier assumes that everyone who went back to school and got the bachelors degree had only achieved a high school education.", "Presumably some in that group would be people who already have associates degrees or some college and didnt have far to go to get a bachelors degree.", "People who have some college or an associates degree generally make more than those with just a high school diploma, and that would have an impact on net benefit to Ohios economy.Regardless, the figure is well below Petros estimate of $2.5 billion.The second document is a memo from Board of Regents staffer Patrick Maloney to Petro which outlines a 2008 Arizona State University study which found that a 1 percent jump would add $1.5 billion to that states economy.The ASU study focuses solely on Arizona and relies on a 2004 Journal of Econometrics paper that estimated the effects on the earnings of all working adults from increasing the proportion of the workforce with a university degree.", "It used data from the 1980 and 1990 census.However, the papers author, Enrico Moretti, didnt specify how he defined adults nor how he calculated hourly wages.", "And Moretti finds a spillover effect which pushes up wages for all workers on every education level as the share of workers with a bachelors degree increases.Because Morettis spillover effect requires different calculations over each level of educational attainment, its virtually impossible to compare Arizona to Ohio as the states have different profiles.", "Additionally, Arizonas labor market is much smaller than Ohios with only 1.82 million workers year-round versus 5.11 million in Ohio  nearly three times as many.If the gains projected in Arizona would come true in Ohio, then you could probably assume an economic benefit of nearly three times what was projected for Arizona -- about $4 billion a year.The third study cited by Waugh comes from a CEO for Cities study, which concludes that an improvement of 1 percentage point in each of the 51 largest metropolitan areas in the United State would increase aggregate personal income by $124 billion nationwide.In the report, the authors explain that each additional percentage point in aggregate adult four-year college attainment was associated with a $763 increase in annual regional per capita income.Per capita income refers to the income of each man, women and child.", "If we apply the increase to Ohios  11.5 million population, we get an additional $8.8 billion a year in income.So where does all this leave Petros claim?As chancellor of the Board of Regents, Petro wanted to show the importance of more adults getting their college degrees.To underscore this point, Petro claimed that a good and solid estimate showed that increasing the number of bachelors degree holders in Ohio by 1 percent would increase economic activity in the state by $2.5 billion a year.Asked for studies to prove this point, Petros staffers muster a pair of memos which assert Ohios income would rise by $1.09 billion a year and another which estimates that Arizonas would rise by $1.5 billion a year.", "The Arizona estimate would extrapolate to about $4 billion in Ohio given the larger labor market here.Lastly, they cite a study done on the nations biggest urban areas, which if applied to Ohios population would mean $8.8 billion in additional income.The underlying point in Petros statement is accurate -- that raising the percentage of Ohioans who have a bachelors degree would benefit Ohios economy.What is less clear is how great that benefit would be.", "Petros estimate was $2.5 billion.", "But the supporting

Randy Hopper, we work hard, we pay our taxes; we cant say the same about you.As the accusation is made, the words Senator Hopper didnt pay taxes appear on the screen above a footnote citing aFond du Lac Reporternewspaper article.(The headline in the newspaper was Hopper fends off tax questions.)The ad not only accuses Hopper of not paying taxes, while average citizens did, but suggests he did something improper or took advantage of the system.Lets see what the record shows.When we asked King campaign spokeswoman Gillian Morris for evidence to back up the ad, she provided the October 2008 newspaperarticlecited in the ad.The article ran less than two weeks before Hopper defeated King, by a recount-confirmed163 votes, to win what was then an open Senate seat in the Fox Valley area of east-central Wisconsin. Their rematch on Aug. 9, 2011, is one of ninerecall electionsthat could determine whether Democrats take control of theSenatefrom Republicans, who now hold a five-seat advantage.According the 2008 article, the liberalOne Wisconsin Nowgroup obtained state Department of Revenue income tax data for Hopper and his five businesses. Since an open records request could take a week or more, and the elections are upon us, we asked One Wisconsin Now for the data they received, which was contained in aletterfrom the revenue department.The letter says that from 1998 through 2007, Hoppers five businesses had no state income tax liability; and that from 1997 through 2007, Hopper personally had a liability in just one year, 2006, of $22,752.(Since then, One Wisconsin Now requested more recent state income tax data for Hopper and received a Department of Revenuelettersaying Hopper had no tax liability in 2008 and 2010, and a tax liability of $27,995 in 2009. But those tax years are not part of our evaluation for this article.)Hopper, who didnt dispute the facts in the 2008 newspaper article, was quoted as saying that in the years when he had no income tax obligation, it was because of business debt and reinvesting in some of the businesses. He also said two of the businesses run by his wife had no revenue.Hopper also said in the article he incurred the one personal income tax obligation, and paid it, because of capital gains he earned from selling one of his radio stations.Its not unprecedented for a state lawmaker to pay no state income taxes. The same holds for other members of the public, based on what the tax laws are and allow, particularly for business owners.In September 2008, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinelfoundthat six lawmakers -- four Republicans and two Democrats -- were among a number of state officials who didnt have a state income tax liability in either 2006 or 2007; one of the lawmakers, state Rep. Mary Williams, R-Medford, hadnt had a state tax bill since before 2000. Tax experts interviewed for the article said those public officials were treated the same as everyone else, noting that most small-business owners show their business earnings or losses on their individual income tax returns.We also contacted Hoppers campaign spokesman, Sean Stephenson, to see if Hopper had any additional response about his taxes.Stephenson said Hoppers radio stations paid nearly $1 million in workers compensation, Social Security, property and other taxes -- but not state income taxes -- from 1998 through 2010.He also pointed out that Hoppers name does not appear on the states list ofdelinquent taxpayers. (We checked, and his businesses arent on the list, either.)Stephenson didnt provide any official documents to back up his claims about taxes Hopper and his business paid. But since King made the allegation that Hopper didnt pay taxes, the burden is on her to prove it.So, lets review the case she made.King claims broadly in a TV ad that Hopper, unlike typical taxpayers, didnt pay taxes. The records indicate that over a decade, Hoppers businesses had no state income tax liability and he owed taxes personally in only one year. But the claim leaves an impression, without providing any evidence, that Hopper did something improper in order not to have a state income tax liability in most of the years in question. After all, this is the language included in the ad: We work hard, we pay our taxes; we cant say the same about you. Moreover, there is no indication that Hopper did not pay the one state income tax liability he did have.We rate Kings claim Barely True.", "hrefs": "http://www.votehopper.com/about-randy.html"}], "label": "barely-true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/jul/22/randy-hopper/wisconsin-gop-state-sen-randy-hopper-says-democrat/", "title": "Says Wisconsin Senate recall candidate Jessica King voted to increase her pay with taxpayer dollars by 63 percent.", "author": "Tom Kertscher", "posted": "07/22/2011", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["JessicaKingwas a part of thefirst graduatingclassofEmerge Wisconsin, which touts itself as the premier program for training Democratic women to run for office.", "She was elected to the Oshkosh Common Council in 2007, even before completing the training.In 2008, King ran for an open seat in the state Senate, but lost to RepublicanRandyHopperof Fond du Lac.", "After a recount, the margin was163votesout of more than 83,000 cast.When Hopper became one of the Republican senators targeted for recall for his support of GOP Gov.", "Scott Walker, King entered the race, creating a rematch.", "Hopper dismissed King as having a liberal tax-and-spend agenda and has since sharpened his attack ahead of theAug.", "9, 2011 election.A HopperTVadreleased July 15, 2011 begins by praising his own work as a lawmaker.", "Then, as background music turns ominous, the narrator says:When you see Jessica Kings negative attacks, remember 63.", "King opposed balancing the state budget and voted to increase her pay with taxpayer dollars by 63 percent.", "Raising your pay by 63?", "Does Jessica King really care about you and me?A politician voting herself a 63 percent pay raise during tough economic times?Thats worth a look.Asked for evidence to back the attack, Hopper campaign spokesman Sean Stephenson cited the2009and2010and Oshkosh city budgets.They show the pay appropriated for the seven council members -- the mayor and six aldermen -- totaled $17,400 in 2008 and had risen to $28,500 in 2010.", "Thats an increase of 63.8 percent.But that doesnt break down how much of a raise King might have received, nor whether she voted for it.", "So we went back to Stephenson, who stood by the 63 percent claim.", "He said the proof King voted for the raise was that she voted for the2009and2010city budgets.King campaign spokeswoman Gillian Morris pointed instead to a vote on a pay raise ordinance the Oshkosh council took April 8, 2008.The ordinance and officialminutesfrom that meeting show the council voted, 4-3, to double the mayors salary to $6,000 and boost the salary of each of the six council members from $2,400 to $3,750, or 56 percent.King voted no on the raises, saying salaries should be reviewed by a citizen committee.Oshkosh City ManagerMarkRohloffsaid the council members pay can be raised only through an ordinance such as the pay ordinance King voted against.", "City budgets cannot authorize pay raises for elected officials; they only carry out what has been legally authorized by an earlier pay ordinance, he said.One more point before we close: By law, elected officials cannot directly vote themselves pay raises.", "Any raises that they adopt cant take effect for a particular office until after that office comes up for election again.The Oshkosh raises took effect in April 2009, a year after the council adopted the pay ordinance.", "So, although King voted against the raises, she did receive the 56 percent raise herself after being re-elected in 2009.Lets get back to the claim.In a TV ad, Hopper said King voted to increase her pay on the Oshkosh Common Council by 63 percent.", "Its ridiculous to claim King voted for the raise, given that she voted against the ordinance that raised the pay -- which is the only legal way council pay can be raised.", "And Hoppers claim of 63 percent itself is false, given that the correct raise figure is a somewhat lower 56 percent.Ridiculous and false.", "Around here, thats a combustible mixture.", "We give Hoppers claim a Pants on Fire."], "issues": ["City Budget", "Income", "Voting Record", "Wisconsin"], "image_data": [], "data": [{"sentence": "JessicaKingwas a part of thefirst graduatingclassofEmerge Wisconsin, which touts itself as the premier program for training Democratic women to run for office.

methodological imperfections with these kinds of studies -- including their failure to account for the value of employer-provided health care and Medicare -- but he said he doesnt doubt the overall trend.When all is said and done, there is fairly uniform consensus that starting in the late 1970s, the distribution of income in society became significantly more unequal, he said.Two conservative economists -- Dan Mitchell of the Cato Institute and J.D.", "Foster of the Heritage Foundation -- raised some of the same methodological concerns as Steuerle, and they also warned against drawing

But is it a real deal? We wanted to find out.It didn't take us long to uncover a federal report, released in January, on Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress prepared for Congress by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. It outlines how pension benefits are calculated.The key provision: no member of Congress is eligible for any pension unless he or she has served in Congress for at least five years. (Senators serve six-year terms; House members must seek reelection every two years.)To collect, a congressman or senator must be age 62, or be age 50 with 20 years of service, or be any age with 25 years of service.Under the most recent pension program, adopted in 1984, the size of a pension is based on the highest three years of a member's salary, the number of years of service and a multiplier, which is 1.7 percent for the first 20 years of service and 1.0 percent for subsequent years. (Typically, for a 25-year rank-and-file member who retired this year, the pension would be the sum of two calculations. First, take $172,443 [the average salary over the last three years] times 20 years times 0.017. Then, add that to $172,443 times 5 years times 0.01. The total: $67,249 per year.)A three-term congressman (or one-term senator) who has now reached retirement age would be eligible for an annual pension of $17,588 for six years of work. That's extremely generous, but not even close to full pay. (Members of Congress are also eligible for Social Security.)Finally, federal law prevents them from getting full-pay retirement when they leave office. The report says, By law, the starting amount of a member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80 percent of his or her final salary. (Under the formula, it would take 67 years of service to hit that limit.)So the email saying that members of Congress can receive full pay retirement after serving one term is blatantly bogus. It's never full pay and the only one-term members who would be eligible for any pension would be senators.This claim has been around the rotunda a few times. Our friends atSnopes.comhave emails dating to 2000 reporting that senators and congressmen, when they retire, continue to draw the same paycheck until they die.FactCheck.org has also debunked the email.Over the years the claim has been accompanied by assertions that members of Congress don't pay into their Social Security (they have since 1984) or they don't contribute anything toward their retirement (they do), or that they are exempt from the new health-care law or claims of sexual harassment (they're not).A quick Google search with the words congress full pay and retirement would reveal the truth. But too many people prefer to make the seat-of-the-slacks decision to simply spread the myth to family and friends. So for them, and the original author of this ill-informed email, we break out the matches and lighter fluid and give them aPants On

often glorifies and glamorizes the idea of having children out of wedlock.A reader suggested we check into the statistical reality of single mothers.", "So we did.The best statistics we found to analyze this issue come from aCensus Bureau data set called Americas Families and Living Arrangements: 2010.One way of analyzing the question comes from a table of statistics detailing living arrangements for children under 18 years and the marital status of their parents.", "These statistics, released in November 2010, offer per-child data.Othertableslook at the data from the point of view of the households, rather than the children.", "Either way, the statistics are broadly similar.Well take Huckabees claims one by one.Most single moms are very poor.While only a minority of children in single-mother households officially live below the poverty level, the income picture still isnt rosy.All told, 43 percent of such children are officially in households below the poverty level, and an additional 28 percent are in households that earn less than twice the poverty level.", "Less than a third -- 30 percent -- live in households that earn more than that.By contrast, only 13 percent children in dual-parent households (whether married or not) live in households that are at or below the poverty level.", "An additional 19 percent live in households that have less than twice the poverty level.", "A full 68 percent live in households with incomes double the poverty level or higher.Looked at by household, slightly under 40 percent of single-mother households are officially below the poverty level.There is no accepted definition of very poor, so the claim is hard to nail down.", "But children in single-mother households are more than twice as likely as those in dual-parent households to be part of families that earn less than twice the poverty level.", "So Huckabee has a point on this statistic.Most single moms are under-educated.Like very poor, the term under-educated is somewhat subjective.", "But well look at the educational patterns for single moms and dual-parent households.Nineteen percent of children in single-mother households have a mom who failed to earn a high-school diploma, compared to 67 percent who graduated high school and/or attended some college, and 14 percent who have a college degree or higher.", "The comparable figures for children in dual-parent households is 8 percent with less than a high-school diploma, 47 percent with a high school degree and/or some college, and 45 percent with a college degree or higher.So its true that children with single moms are more than twice as likely those of dual-parent households to be the child of a high-school dropout.", "On the other hand, a full 81 percent of children of single moms have a mom who graduated from high school.", "Thats lower than the 92 percent rate for dual-parent households, but it still seems a stretch to say that most single moms are under-educated.Most single moms can't get a job.In single-mother households, 74 percent of moms are considered in the labor force, compared to 26 percent who are not in the labor force.Being in the labor force means that you are either working or are trying to.", "So we have to look to aseparate statistic from the Bureau of Labor Statisticsto see whether single moms are actually being employed,

rate was lower the previous year, before the worst of the recession hit.", ")How does employment compare between single moms and married moms?", "According to calculations for PolitiFact by Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, the data show that single moms are actuallylikelierto work than married moms.For mothers with the youngest child under age 6,

a large majority of single moms are both part of the workforce and are successful at getting jobs.", "On this statistic, Huckabee is completely off base.If it weren't for government assistance, their

households get food stamps, while 16 percent get cash assistance.So while the rates of food stamp and public assistance use are certainly higher among single-mother households, they still represent a minority of single-mother households.", "It seems like a stretch for Huckabee to say that most kids of single-mother households would starve without public assistance.Single mothers are a highly

Mike Huckabee, a possible contender for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, caused a firestorm when he criticized movie star Natalie Portman.Speaking to conservative radio host Michael Medved,Huckabee said, One of the things that is troubling is that people see a Natalie Portman or some other Hollywood starlet who boasts of, 'Hey look, we're having children, we're not married, but we're having these children, and they're doing just fine. But there aren't really a lot of single moms out there who are making millions of dollars every year for being in a movie.After the comment hit the wider airwaves, Huckabee posted the following comment on the website of HuckPac, his political action committee.In a recent media interview about my new book, A Simple Government, I discussed the first chapter, The Most Important Form of Government Is a Father, Mother, and Children,he wrote.  I was asked about Oscar-winner Natalie Portman's out-of-wedlock pregnancy. Natalie is an extraordinary actor, very deserving of her recent Oscar, and I am glad she will marry her baby's father. However, contrary to what the Hollywood media reported, I did not slam or attack Natalie Portman, nor did I criticize the hardworking single mothers in our country. My comments were about the statistical reality that most single moms are very poor, under-educated, can't get a job, and if it weren't for government assistance, their kids would be starving to death. That's the story that we're not seeing, and it's unfortunate that society often glorifies and glamorizes the idea of having children out of wedlock.A reader suggested we check into the statistical reality of single mothers. So we did.The best statistics we found to analyze this issue come from aCensus Bureau data set called Americas Families and Living Arrangements: 2010.One way of analyzing the question comes from a table of statistics detailing living arrangements for children under 18 years and the marital status of their parents. These statistics, released in November 2010, offer per-child data.Othertableslook at the data from the point of view of the households, rather than the children. Either way, the statistics are broadly similar.Well take Huckabees claims one by one.Most single moms are very poor.While only a minority of children in single-mother households officially live below the poverty level, the income picture still isnt rosy.All told, 43 percent of such children are officially in households below the poverty level, and an additional 28 percent are in households that earn less than twice the poverty level. Less than a third -- 30 percent -- live in households that earn more than that.By contrast, only 13 percent children in dual-parent households (whether married or not) live in households that are at or below the poverty level. An additional 19 percent live in households that have less than twice the poverty level. A full 68 percent live in households with incomes double the poverty level or higher.Looked at by household, slightly under 40 percent of single-mother households are officially below the poverty level.There is no accepted definition of very poor, so the claim is hard to nail down. But children in single-mother households are more than twice as likely as those in dual-parent households to be part of families that earn less than twice the poverty level. So Huckabee has a point on this statistic.Most single moms are under-educated.Like very poor, the term under-educated is somewhat subjective. But well look at the educational patterns for single moms and dual-parent households.Nineteen percent of children in single-mother households have a mom who failed to earn a high-school diploma, compared to 67 percent who graduated high school and/or attended some college, and 14 percent who have a college degree or higher. The comparable figures for children in dual-parent households is 8 percent with less than a high-school diploma, 47 percent with a high school degree and/or some college, and 45 percent with a college degree or higher.So its true that children with single moms are more than twice as likely those of dual-parent households to be the child of a high-school dropout. On the other hand, a full 81 percent of children of single moms have a mom who graduated from high school. Thats lower than the 92 percent rate for dual-parent households, but it still seems a stretch to say that most single moms are under-educated.Most single moms can't get a job.In single-mother households, 74 percent of moms are considered in the labor force, compared to 26 percent who are not in the labor force.Being in the labor force means that you are either working or are trying to. So we have to look to aseparate statistic from the Bureau of Labor Statisticsto see whether single moms are actually being employed, rather than merely trying.The data shows that in 2009, about 66 percent of single moms were employed, with an unemployment rate of 13.6 percent. (The employment rate was higher and the unemployment rate was lower the previous year, before the worst of the recession hit.)How does employment compare between single moms and married moms? According to calculations for PolitiFact by Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, the data show that single moms are actuallylikelierto work than married moms.For mothers with the youngest child under age 6, nearly 68 percent are in the labor force -- that is, either working or looking for work. The comparable number for married moms living with their spouses is 62 percent. For those with the youngest child between 6 and 17 years of age, 79 percent of single moms were in the labor force, compared to 77 percent of married moms.Burtless found that rates of actual employment are also very close between the two groups.The crucial thing he missed -- and that many Republicans dont seem to understand -- is that a lot of those mothers do work, said Ron Haskins, who as a Republican congressional staffer helped write the 1996 welfare reform bill. The government has done a lot to basically force them to work. That was the essence of welfare reform.So, any way you look at it, a large majority of single moms are both part of the workforce and are successful at getting jobs. On this statistic, Huckabee is completely off base.If it weren't for government assistance, their kids would be starving to death.Among children with single mothers, 41 percent get food stamps and 59 percent dont. By contrast, 11 percent in dual-parent households get food stamps and 89 percent do not.Meanwhile, 10 percent of children in single-mother households get other kinds of cash assistance while 90 percent do not. For those in dual-parent households, 2 percent get cash assistance and 98 percent do not. (The statistics can vary depending on how you define cash assistance; were going by the Census Bureaus definition.)Looked at by household, 32 percent of single-mother households get food stamps, while 16 percent get cash assistance.So while the rates of food stamp and public assistance use are certainly higher among single-mother households, they still represent a minority of single-mother households. It seems like a stretch for Huckabee to say that most kids of single-mother households would starve without public assistance.Single mothers are a highly disadvantaged group in many ways, said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But they are not quite so badly off as Huckabee says. In fact, a large majority of them are managing to remain gainfully employed even in the depths of this terrible economy.What is meant by 'single mothers'?Douglas J. Besharov, a University of Maryland public policy professor who was previously a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the numbers we found didn't surprise him much, though he did note that some people use the term single mother to mean mother who had a child while single. To be extra cautious, we checked out this category separately.The best number we could find to approximate that group was the never married statistic, which excludes mothers who became single as a result of being widowed, separated, divorced or abandoned by a spouse.We found that the numbers are somewhat more dire for this subgroup than they are for single mothers as a whole, but not dramatically so. On education, 24 percent had less than a high-school diploma, compared to 19 percent for all single moms. Food stamp use was 50 percent, compared to 41 percent for all single moms, and 14 percent got public assistance, compared to 10 percent for all single moms. A full 70 percent of never-married single moms were in the work force, compared to 74 percent for all single moms.The one factor that showed the biggest variation was poverty. More than half -- 51 percent -- of never-married single moms are officially at the poverty line, and an additional 26 percent are between 100 percent and 200 percent of the poverty level. That compares to 43 percent of all single moms officially below the poverty level and an additional 28 percent at less than twice the poverty level. But this was already the statistic where Huckabee was closest to being right.Our conclusionEven if the numbers for never-married moms had been dramatically different, we don't think it would justify Huckabee's comment, since the his wording didnt distinguish among types of single moms. We should also note that Portmanhas said she plans to marry the babys father, so she would actually fit best into the living with both parents, not married to each other category, which we included in our dual-parent household category, not the single-mother category.So where does this leave us? Theres a pretty strong case that Huckabee is right about poverty in single-mother households. But his claims about educational attainment and government assistance are exaggerated, and the majority of kids living with single moms put food on the table without public assistance. And one claim is flat-out wrong -- that single moms arent able to get jobs. Lots of single mothers do -- often in higher rates than married moms.

The most recent tax year available is 2007.(According to a transcript provided to us by the Whitehouse staff, the senator actually said he thought the report was from 2009.)One other clarification is important. The IRS is reporting on the top 400 individual tax returns, which could include a couple filing jointly.The IRS report says that, in 2007, the average adjusted gross income for the top 400 returns was $344 million. The average income tax paid per return was $57 million -- an average of 16.6 percent, as Whitehouse said. So on that point, he was right.Out of curiosity, members of PolitiFact Rhode Island checked our returns for 2007. We found that our tax rates were even lower than 16.6 percent, and we make a lot more than Whitehouse's hypothetical $29,000-a-year hospital orderly.So we checked Whitehouse's example, using tax rates,standard deductions and personal exemptionsfor both2007and2010.We discovered that Whitehouse was off -- way off.That unmarried orderly filing a simple single return would be taxed at a rate of 9.1 percent in 2007 and 8.7 percent in 2010, not more than 16.6.Then, using IRS tax tables and schedules, we did some math to determine how much income a single person filing the simplest tax return would need before his tax rate exceeded that of the richest Americans.To hit a tax rate of 16.6 percent, that orderly would need to have made about $68,750 in 2007 and $73,500 in 2010, we calculated.When we showed our numbers to Whitehouse's staff, they said our results were misleading because we failed to include taxes for Medicare (1.45 percent) and Social Security (6.2 percent on the first $106,000 of income).The vast majority of the income of the 400 wealthiest Americans is not subject to payroll taxes, whereas a worker with annual income around $29,000 would have to pay payroll taxes on all of their income, a statement from Whitehouses office said.", "hrefs": "http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/09/trent-franks/trent-franks-says-top-1-percent-pays-over-half-ent/"}, {"sentence": "Leaving this data out of any comparison will paint a very uneven picture of the total taxes paid by working-class Americans.Although IRS spokeswoman Peggy Riley said those taxes arenotfactored into the IRS analysis, we understand the point of including them because the Social Security tax, in particular, has a significant impact on low- and middle-income people.According to calculations by Whitehouses office -- which match our own -- when you include Social Security and Medicare taxes, the effective tax rate for the wealthiest 400 Americans would have been 16.72 percent in 2007; the tax rate for a worker earning $29,000 a year would have been 16.79 percent.In short, Whitehouse accurately reported the IRS's most recent summary of its top 400 tax filers, even if he incorrectly cited the year of the report.When we audited his suggestion that the super-rich pay a lower rate than someone making just $29,000, we concluded he's right if you include all payroll taxes, but off by about $40,000 if you only consider income tax, as the IRS report does.We rate his statement asMostly True.", "hrefs": "https://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/"}], "label": "mostly-true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/feb/22/phil-king/phil-king-says-40-percent-family-incomes-goes-taxe/", "title": "Says families now pay out 40 percent of their income to taxes.", "author": "W.

Income and wage are two different things. Income can include a lot of things other than just wages, such as investment income or capital gains.To get more precisely at what Maddow cited, Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution pointed us toCensus Bureau figuresfor the median annual wage of workers who are on full-time schedules. These statistics show that the inflation-adjusted median earnings of full-time male workers fell 4.5 percent between 1980 and 1990 (declining from $46,127 to $44,033 ) while the real median earnings of full-time female workers increased 13.6 percent (climbing from $27,750 to $31,535).You would think the Census would provide combined figures in this category for for men and women, but it doesn't. As a result, Burtless said, its hard for me to guess whether the real median wage for both men and women increased exactly 3 percent during the decade. However, the estimate does not look unreasonable in view of the relative number of male and female full-time workers in the labor force.As for Maddow's claim that from 1980 to 1990, the top 1 percent saw their income go up by roughly 80 percent, the Census Bureau again leaves us wanting.The Census Bureau tracks income by quintiles, but not the top 1 percent.It's unclear where Maddow got her statistic, but several economists suggested it must have been from the analyses of tax data performed by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez.So we contacted Saez, an economics professor at the University of California Berkeley, who said tax data he compiled with Piketty show that average inflation-adjusted income (pre-tax) per family in the top 1 percent increased from $427,000 in 1980 to $661,000 in 1990. That's a 55 percent increase. Meanwhile, the average income (pre-tax) per family in the bottom 90 percent fell slightly from $30,900 in 1980 to $30,800 in 1990, he said. You can see all of the results in Table A6 oftheir report.So how did Maddow get to 80 percent?Saez believes Maddow must have used statistics in the report that did not include capital gains (Table A4), which show the same stagnation in the bottom 90 percent but a bigger, 74 percent increase at the top 1 percent.All economists agree that the 1980s saw a huge increase in inequality, Saez said. There was increased concentration at the top and big losses at the bottom (especially during the early 1980s recession).Added Burtless: Ms. Maddow seems to be completely correct that incomes at the very top increased many times faster than the real median wage.As for Moore's claim that everyone's income went up...The lowest income people had the biggest gains, he's only half right. It's true that everyone's income went up. But adjusted for inflation, the lowest income people saw the smallest percentage of gain.Said Burtless: Incomes rose in the bottom, middle, and top portions of the income distribution as Mr. Moore stated, although the income gains were certainly bigger at the top compared with the bottom. These results clearly show that low-income Americans did not obtain the biggest income gains between 1980 and 1990.According toCensus data, when presented in equivalent 2009 dollars, the income among the lowest fifth increased about 6.3 percent (from $10,682 to $11,400). That's the lowest gain compared to other quintiles: 7.9 percent for the second lowest fifth; 8 percent for the middle fifth; 10.5 percent for the fourth fifth, and 20.3 percent in the highest fifth. Incomes rose 28.2 percent among the top 5 percent.Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute summed up the Maddow-Moore exchange this way: She's right, he's wrong. He might have been thinking about the '90s, when everyones income did indeed go up, even at the bottom, (but even in the nineties the people at the top made the biggest gains). You have to go back to the '50s and '60s to find business cycles where growth was faster at the bottom.Larry Bartels, a political scientist at Princeton and author of Unequal Democracy, believes the best indicator of the real income change of the top 1 percent between 1980 and 1990 is the Piketty/Saez figure of 55 percent.Id say Maddow exaggerated a bit but got the general story right, whereas Moore was not within shouting distance of anything true, Bartels said. Of course, how much of this can be attributed to the Reagan tax cuts is a separate question, and worth debating in its own right.Again, we're not wading into the debate about whether Reagan tax cuts had anything to do with the growing gap in income inequality. To see some of the varying viewpoints among economists on that issue, check out an article by Slate's Timothy Noah on Sept. 9, 2010, which ran under the headline,The United States of Inequality: Can We Blame Income Inequality on Republicans?At issue are the statistics Maddow and Moore used to underpin their arguments. In this case, Maddow said that from 1980 to 1990, the top 1 percent saw their income go up by roughly 80 percent and that at the same time the median wage in the country over 10 years went up 3 percent. The median wage in the country, expressed in constant 2009 dollars, does appear to be in the range Maddow cited (though with statistics broken out separately for men and women, we can't be precise). As for Maddow's claim that the top 1 percent saw their income go up that decade by roughly 80 percent, that's close but only if you cite numbers that do not include capital gains. It's not unreasonable to cite those numbers, but the economists we spoke to preferred to use figures that included capital gains, which show the top 1 percent saw an increase of 55 percent.

Indeed, there is simply no way to calculate this with any utility or accuracy. It would take global companies months and thousands of hours to come up with a completely useless number. We would urge the SEC to implement this provision with extreme care.Do these types of comparisons make any difference? We turned to Graef Crystal, an expert in executive compensation and a frequent critic of CEO pay, for his views. These numbers get thrown around a lot by people to prove whatever, he said. Some CEOs might be surprised by the numbers, he said, but generally what matters most to executives and those who set their pay is how they compare to their peers, he said. They dont look down, and they dont look across at China.In fact, he said, as proxy statements disclose details about pay that may now be opaque, it could ratchet up pay.He also noted that there is a significant correlation between sales volume and the pay of CEOs. Crystal has his own database of companies, which produced an average pay rate of $10.1 million in 2009, he said. But if you sort it by sales volume, the top 100 companies average $14.4 million, Expand it to the top 200, and the average drops to $11.7 million.The S&P 500 is only part of a much larger universe of publicly traded firms. It is made up of 500 firms which have market capitalization (number of shares multiplied by stock price) of $10 million or more. In contrast there are nearly 6,000 publicly traded firms on the nations two largest stock exchanges. So comparing the compensation of CEOs at only the select companies in the S&P 500 to the pay for all nonsupervisory production workers is not an apples-to-apples comparison.Turning back to the bumper sticker, is it true that corporate executives earn 431 times as much as the average worker? Not any more, since the most recent study in the same series found the figure in 2009 was 263 times the average worker pay. But, having gone through the pain of removing outdated bumper stickers ourselves, well allow a little leeway for the figures lack of currency. And, leaving aside the question of whether it is warranted or not, there is still a sizable gap between corporate executive pay and worker pay, although probably not as large as the gap between S&P 500 CEOs and the average of all nonsupervisory production workers, some of whom work at much smaller companies.

Hood enrolls about 33,000 students and is in the top five of Oregon's 17 community colleges. It lacks the profile given its larger sisters -- Portland and Clackamas community colleges -- yet, here are two surprising claims from Mt. Hoodswebsiteandpress release:", "hrefs": "http://www.mhcc.edu/news.aspx?id=2580"}, {"sentence": "In a Nov. 22 statement, the college says: We can no longer pay salaries to our most experienced faculty that are far above the average of community colleges in Oregon, Washington and Idaho.PolitiFact Oregon never realized community college pay could be so rewarding to paychecks, and so crushing to a schools budget. The numbers, we figured, would be easy to vet.In thefaculty negotiationssection of Mt. Hoods website is a link to the National Education Associations higher education salary study, released this spring. The average salary for faculty at Mt. Hood was $69,200 in 2008-09 -- indeed the highest of 17 community colleges in Oregon, 34 community colleges in Washington, and three schools in Idaho. The average benefit at Mt. Hood for the year was $27,800, again the highest of 54 colleges. Total average pay and benefits came to $97,000.For context, average faculty pay at Portland Community College, the states largest two-year, was $62,100 with benefits at $23,800 for a total $85,900 in 2008-09. Faculty at Clackamas Community College averaged $66,000 in salary and $24,600 in benefits, for a total $90,600.(It looks as if Mt. Hood and Clackamas were more in line in2007-08. Average compensation at Mt. Hood was $94,400, and $93,900 at Clackamas. Salaries are based on nine- or 10-month  contracts.) So you can check the first claim as True.The second claim is that base salary for full-time faculty at top scale at Mt. Hood was more than 8 percent higher than average top pay of community colleges closest in size to Mt. Hood, in 2009-10. The numbers pencil out, based onMt. Hoods figures. The average of top salaries at Clackamas, Chemeketa, Linn-Benton, Lane and Portland community colleges is $74,735, compared with $80,864 at Mt. Hood, or a difference of 8.2 percent.We checked with contracts for the individual schools and confirmed that Mt. Hoods figures are pretty much correct, with the exception of Lane Community College, which was off by roughly $1,000 so the difference is actually 7.3 percent. In any case, its a similar sized gap.But Shannon Valdivia, a speech instructor at Mt. Hood, raises an excellent question of calendar years. Colleges differ in how many days to expect of faculty. So faculty at Mt. Hood and at Portland worked 180-day calendars in 2009-10; Linn-Benton faculty worked 164 days; Chemeketa, Clackamas and Lane had 175 days. Calculate by day, and top earners at Linn-Benton earned the most at $475 a day. Mt. Hood came in second with $449 earned a day.The average of the five schools was $431.24 a day -- or 4 percent less than Mt. Hoods $449.Now, were skipping comparisons based on health benefits because faculty choose different types of plans. But know that Mt. Hood is on the nicer side with faculty kicking in a maximum of $75 a month for family coverage. On a per-day basis, top base pay at Mt. Hood and Linn-Benton are comparable. So well rate claim No. 2 Half True.So, why is pay at Mt. Hood so high? Well, more than half of the 156 faculty at the college are at top scale. Thats a large percentage. Eighty people are in step 1 of a 14-step pay scale; 76 are in steps 2 to 14. The faculty union says some people were hired at too high a step; college administrators say the increase between steps is too big. (Faculty climb from one step to the next once a year; people who are at the top step will get cost-of-living adjustments if bargained for.) But thats neither here nor there.If you combine the two claims together, we rate the overall claim on pay as Mostly True. Its accurate -- average pay is high in large part because top tier pay is high, and so many people are in that top tier -- but it needs just a tiny bit of additional information on pay broken down by day.", "hrefs": "http://home.mhcc.edu/negotiation/FTfaculty/main.htm"}, {"sentence": "Comment on this item.", "hrefs": "http://www.oregonlive.com/gresham/index.ssf/2010/12/politifact_oregon_checks_mhccs.html"}], "label": "mostly-true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2010/dec/13/matthew-dowd/matthew-dowd-says-economy-has-only-worsened-under-/", "title": "Barack Obama is in an economy that's only worsened since he's been president of the United States.", "author": "Louis Jacobson", "posted": "12/13/2010", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["During the Dec. 12, 2010, edition of ABC'sThis Week with Christiane Amanpour, Matthew Dowd, a former strategist for President George W.

delegation, the Virginia Tea Party Patriot Federation recently called for an audit of the Federal Reserve System, blaming the bank for pushing the nation further into debt and devaluing the dollar.The letter comes in response to Fed Chairman Ben Bernankes plan to buy $600 billion in additional U.S. Treasury bonds.The Fed, which was created and initially funded with taxpayer gold and monies by an Act of Congress, is opaque and operates in secrecy.", "It has done so since its inception in 1913, the letter reads.", "Since that time, the U.S. Dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power.", "We believe that this alone is compelling reason enough to tear down the veil and audit the Fed.", "Chairman Bernanke's recent actions make the need for this audit all the more urgent.Upon hearing the 98 percent number we wondered two things:1) Really?2) And if so, is it all the Feds fault?Asked how they arrived at their conclusion, the letters co-authors said they used gold.In 1913 the official price of an ounce of gold was $20.64.", "Today, an ounce of gold buys $1,370.", "That is an increase in the price of gold of some 6,530%; seen another way, the value of the dollar versus gold has fallen 98.5 percent, explained Jamie Jacoby with the Richmond Tea Party.Those numbers do check out.", "But they are meaningless, according to C. Barry Pfitzner, a professor of economics at Randolph-Macon College.Pfitzner noted that the U.S. is no longer on the gold standard, which ended in 1914.", "Even the gold exchange standard -- under which official holders of dollars like foreign banks and treasuries could convert dollar holdings to gold -- ended in 1971.The current market gold price is nothing more than the equivalent of any other speculative commodity.", "Not unlike, say, silver, diamonds, platinum -- or for that matter, hog futures, Pfitzner said.", "So one could argue that the dollar has lost 98 percent of its power to purchase gold.", "So what?", "Irrelevant.", "And the Fed is not to blame.", "It does not control the price of gold.Dean Croushore, chair of the economic department in University of Richmonds Robins School of Business, agreed.Economists generally think of purchasing power as the amount of goods that a person can buy with a dollar, not the amount of gold that a person can buy with a dollar, he said.", "Measuring the amount of goods that one can buy with a dollar is best done using a price index, such as the consumer price index.Well, thats easy enough.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, a dollar in 1913 had the same buying power as $22.09 today, about a 95 percent decline.Rather than the gold standard, the BLS calculator uses the average Consumer Price Index for a given calendar year.", "That data represents changes in prices of all goods and services purchased for consumption by urban households.Now, on to the next point.", "Is the Fed really responsible for the dollar's decline in value over 90-plus years?That is not a great record and the blame does belong with the Federal Reserve, especially in the high inflation years from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, Croushore said.", "He added that the Feds record improved in the past 20 years, when the average annual inflation rate has been 2.5 percent.Pfitzner noted two problems with putting all the blame on the Fed: the change in what money is used for and the difference in incomes.No economist would argue that the index from 1913 is comparable to the index in 2010, Pfitzner said.", "The mix of goods that consumers purchase is entirely different.As to his second point, the annual income per person today is about $33,000 today, compared to about $400 in 1913.", "So while the dollar is worth far less today, we have far more of them to spend.If we blame the Fed for inflation (and the taming of inflation in recent decades), seems they should also get some credit for growth in real incomes, Pfitzner said.Barry Bosworth, an economist at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, said the Federal Reserve isn't responsible for the U.S. dollar's value, which he called pretty constant relative to other currencies.The decline in the value of the dollar is the result of inflation, but advocates of the gold standard may argue that it could have been avoided if the U.S. had stayed on the gold standard, so they blame the Federal Reserve Bank, Bosworth said.So lets look back over the facts.No doubt, the value of a dollar has plummeted since 1913, when milk cost eight cents a quart.", "The Tea Partys says the buck has dropped by 98 percent, but its use of the gold standard to measure the greenback is not a relevant gauge.", "Using the Consumer Price index, as many economists recommend, we find the dollar fell by 95 percent since 1913.So the Tea Party, despite its disputed methods, wound up with a figure thats in the ballpark.But in bemoaning the drop in value of a dollar, the Tea Party omits a huge mitigating factor: salaries have grown enormously since 1913 and consumers have more to spend.", "If the Feds historic handling of inflation is to be blamed for the drop in the dollar, it must be credited for the rise in wages.We rate the claim Half True."], "issues": ["Economy", "Financial Regulation", "Income", "Virginia"],
