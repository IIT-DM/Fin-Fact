Take U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton.The Democrat from Copley Township faces U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, in one of only two battles of House incumbents this November. They are fighting for Ohios 16th District, which encompasses parts of western Cuyahoga County and parts of five other counties to the south.At a debate Oct. 10, 2012, at the City Club of Cleveland, Sutton moved quickly to tag Renacci with the outsourcer label.Asked about the role of government in creating jobs, Sutton talked of sponsoring legislation to promote the use of U.S. goods in infrastructure projects. Then she shifted into attack mode.We can also close those loopholes that my opponent has consistently voted for that encourage outsourcing of our jobs and stop ... continuing to support bad trade deals, as my opponent has voted for three bad trade deals that are not going to serve Ohio well in the future, she said.Renacci took exception to the loophole part of the claim.Id love for her to tell me one of those loopholes shes talking about, he said a minute later after answering another question from moderator Mike McIntyre of The Plain Dealer. I dont know what those deductions are to send jobs overseas, those loopholes. Id love to hear it someday.PolitiFact Ohio was curious, too.By way of background, corporate tax rates overseas are typically lower than those in the United States. U.S.-based multinational companies must also pay domestic taxes on foreign profits, but not until they return -- or repatriate -- those earnings to their home country. And many companies, through keen accounting and reinvestment abroad, make sure that never happens.The practice is known as deferral. We found a good primer on this subjectposted by Howard Gleckman, editor of TaxVox, a blog from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.Lets also quickly address terminology.Arecent itemfrom our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin was helpful here. They note that, as defined by the National Academy of Public Administration, outsourcing is the contracting out of services domestically or internationally. When a company shifts service and manufacturing activities abroad to unaffiliated firms or their own affiliates, thats called off shoring. What Sutton described seems to fit more under the off shoring, but outsourcing is recognized as a catch-all.With that out of the way, lets examine Renaccis record.As Exhibit A, Sutton campaign spokesman Anthony DeAngelo offered the Republican budget proposal from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, whom GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has tapped as his running mate. Ryans budget sought in part to move toward whats known as a territorial tax system. Such a system would lift U.S. taxes on foreign profits, meaning that a multinational corporation would not have to pay taxes on overseas earnings it repatriates.Renacci voted in favor of the Republican budget and against the Democratic alternative, offered as an amendment to Ryans proposal. The Democratic plan failed in the Republican-controlled House. Ryans budget was later blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.DeAngelo also pointed to Renaccis vote in favor of the Simpler, Fairer Tax Code Act of 2012. This also would have moved the U.S. toward territorial taxation. The bill passed the House in August on a largely party-line vote but has not been taken up by the Senate.Proponents of territorial taxation, including Renacci, argue that it would level the playing field with other countries and encourage repatriation. Opponents worry that the system will make it even more enticing for U.S. companies to move jobs overseas. Gleckman legitimized these fears, noting that such a shift might encourage some domestic companies to move more of their operations -- and shift both jobs and more reported income -- to low tax countries.PolitiFact Wisconsin weighed in on a similar claim by AFSCME. The large public-employees union said in a television ad that U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs.AFSCME pointed to Thompsons stated support of the Ryan budget as back-up.

Republicans produced legislation that would have prevented the board from taking such action. Democrats called it the Outsourcers Bill of Rights and argued it would make it easier to shift jobs overseas.And in April, Renacci voted against a package of Democratic amendments to the Small Business Tax Cut Act.

up, in my opinion is a defeating strategy and will yield ultimate decline and collapse.In his 2010 book,No Apology, Romney wrote that action by the government to protect individual industries should be rare and temporary.President Obamas action to defend American tire companies from foreign competition may make good politics by repaying unions for his support of their campaign, but it is decidedly bad for the nation and our workers.", "Protectionism stifles productivity, he wrote.Finally, in apolicy memo, Romneys policy director Lanhee Chen also characterized Obamas intervention as

sector are offset against gains in tire manufacturing.As for those higher prices, the Peterson study said consumers paid an extra $1.1 billion for tires in 2011 because of the tariffs, and adding

releasedan adsaying the president held firm against China in a trade decision, to the benefit of American tire manufacturers.When a flood of Chinese tires threatened a thousand American jobs, it was President Obama who stood up to China and protected American workers, a narrator says as images from manufacturing plants flash on the screen. Mitt Romney attacked Obama's decision  said standing up to China was bad for the nation and our workers.It concludes with the line, How can Mitt Romney take on the cheaters when hes taking their side?Were checking whether Obama saved 1,000 American tire-making jobs and whether Romney criticized him for it. In addition, we discovered ample analysis of Obamas action that calls into question whether it protected some workers but harmed others.The backgroundThe United States and China became permanent, normal trading partners in 2001, after China joined the World Trade Organization. As a condition of joining, China agreed to a provision in law that lets the U.S. government determine whether a product from China is being imported in such increased quantities that it causes market disruption to domestic producers.In the years following that agreement, several petitions were filed under the provision, called Section 421. But President George W. Bush rejected the petitions on the reasoning that any limitations on Chinese products would be filled in by other foreign exporters and American companies would not ultimately benefit.A Section 421 petition is what brought the tire question to Obamas desk.In 2009, the United Steelworkers sought relief from a surge in Chinese tire imports that the union said had cost more than 5,000 U.S. jobs since 2004. A panel with theU.S. International Trade Commission heard the caseand determined that certain passenger vehicle and light truck tires from the Peoples Republic of China are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of like or directly competitive products.The panel recommended a three-year tariff, of 55 percent in the first year, 45 percent in the second year and 35 percent in the third year. Obama did impose a tax, albeit a lighter one of 35 percent, 30 percent and 25 percent over three years. It was the first time a president approved Section 421 relief on imports from China. China appealed the tariff to the WTO but lost. It expires this month.Astudy by the Peterson Institute for International Economicsfound that the tariffs saved as many as 1,200 domestic jobs. The studys lead author, Gary Clyde Hufbauer, served as deputy assistant secretary for international trade and investment policy under President Jimmy Carter. He has written extensively about international trade.What Romney saidThe Obama campaign cited three instances of Romney criticizing Obamas move.The first is a video,unearthed by theNew Republic, of Romney speaking at the conservative group Foreign Policy Initiative in September 2009, the month Obama imposed the tariffs.Romney said these kinds of protections just encourage lower productivity.The tire workers of America look at these tires coming in from China and say this is not good for me. ... But if thats what their response is, my experience is over time, they will lose out slowly but surely. As they protect their lack of productivity with barriers, they will become less and less competitive, the foreign guys will get more and more volume, more and more successful, theyll become more and more productive. The domestic guys get less and less productive, less and less competitive, until finally even the tariff cant hold them out and the foreign products come flooding into the marketplace and the domestic guys are gone. So putting barriers up, trying to put walls up, in my opinion is a defeating strategy and will yield ultimate decline and collapse.In his 2010 book,No Apology, Romney wrote that action by the government to protect individual industries should be rare and temporary.President Obamas action to defend American tire companies from foreign competition may make good politics by repaying unions for his support of their campaign, but it is decidedly bad for the nation and our workers. Protectionism stifles productivity, he wrote.Finally, in apolicy memo, Romneys policy director Lanhee Chen also characterized Obamas intervention as little more than a favor to unions that backed his campaign.What message does it send the Chinese when President Obama takes protectionist action against China on behalf of Big Labor, undermining free trade principles for political gain? The Obama campaign has repeatedly held out its Section 421 action against Chinese tires as an example of President Obamas supposedly tough China policy.Did the tariff protect jobs?Its clear to us that the claims in the ad are substantially accurate. Obama did push back against China to protect American tire manufacturing jobs, and Romney did criticize him.But Romney wasnt alone, and we think its worth examining the real effect of the tariffs on American jobs. Some pro-trade groups tell a different side of the story than the ad.The U.S.-China Business Council, a private organization comprised of companies that do business with China, said the tariff did succeed in lowering Chinese imports, as expected, but the vacuum wasnt filled by American producers.Were still importing a lot of tires from Indonesia, Taiwan and Mexico, said communications director Marc Ross. It just shifted supply chains.Whats more,the council saidjob gains for tire makers were more likely due to the burgeoning economic recovery and improved outlook for the auto industry, more so than the tariff.ThePeterson Institute study, mentioned above, did attribute 1,200 tire jobs to the tariff, but found there were other employment casualties.The additional money that U.S. consumers spent on tires reduced their spending on other retail goods, indirectly lowering employment in the retail industry, the authors wrote.The fallout? On balance, it seems likely that tire protectionism cost the U.S. economy around 2,531 jobs, when losses in the retail sector are offset against gains in tire manufacturing.As for those higher prices, the Peterson study said consumers paid an extra $1.1 billion for tires in 2011 because of the tariffs, and adding further to the loss column, China retaliated by imposing antidumping duties on U.S. exports of chicken parts, costing that industry around $1 billion in sales.TheWall Street Journalnotedthat the steelworkers union believes the measure has been a success, adding jobs to the U.S. It cites anecdotal and other evidence of production expansion across the industry. Some companies have indeed added production and employees, but whether that is a result of the tariff or the recovery in the U.S. economy isn't entirely clear.Our rulingObamas ad is accurate in stating that the president imposed trade sanctions against China in an effort to protect American workers and Mitt Romney attacked Obama's decision.But did the tariffs work? Thats less clear. Romney said the result was bad for our workers, and there are studies that back him up. Even with tire-making jobs that were saved, one analysis found that the higher price of tires depressed spending on other retail, and ultimately led to a loss in retail jobs.The statement in the ad is accurate, but it needs additional information about the tire tariffs effect.

Other considerations out of Obamas control (and Bushs) held greater sway, he said. When the country has more trade, youre going to have more cases. And trade with China has boomed over the decade. The economic climate matters. While the government brings cases to the WTO, its staff relies on private companies to come forward with strong evidence of wrongdoing. That requires companies to be motivated to do the legwork. In boom times, theres less motivation. An economic downturn makes a difference. Private companies have been much more aggrieved in the last few years than the first few years. China hasnt been as welcoming. It just isn't as friendly to companies as it was during the Bush administration, Hufbauer said. That wasn't because of the Bush administration  but because of the times.  This is leading companies to see more of the downside. That means theyre more willing to spend time to help the government build trade cases.One piece of evidence that Obamas administration has been deliberately more aggressive than Bushs deals with use of safeguards under Section 421 of U.S. trade law, which will be allowed by the WTO through 2013. The section allows U.S. industries to request blocking particular imports from China to protect American companies.

Lisa P. Tomasso.Rhode Islands exports have increased by 53 percent in the last two years, the Coventry Democratsaid in a State House news releaseon April 5. This is something we need to pay attention to. Exports are essential to economic growth, not only in the nation but here at home in Rhode Island.Fifty-three percent. Thats quite an increase, a surprising one considering the well-known ills of the state economy. So naturally we wondered whether its really true.When I heard it, my reaction was the same, Tomasso said when we asked her about the increase.She told us that she heard the figure at a recent meeting of the General Assemblys Joint Committee on Economic Development in Rhode Island, of which she is a member. The information on exports was part of a presentation put together by the John H. Chafee Center for International Business at Bryant University.While we waited for her to get us a copy of that PowerPoint presentation, we started our own research on the issue.Information on Rhode Islands exports, it turns out, is easy to find on the web. TheInternational Trade Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce, tracks all sorts of data on exports nationally and by state. We used atoolon the ITAs website to create tables on Rhode Islands exports for the past seven years.Rhode Island has exported products to 184 countries since 2009. The states leading foreign market is Canada, which accounts for more than a quarter of the states exports in terms of dollar value. Germany and Mexico are second and third, respectively.The states top exports are waste and scrap -- which account for 30.2 percent of total exports -- followed by manufactured metals (13.5 percent), chemicals (11.1 percent), miscellaneous manufactured products, including jewelry, medical equipment, sporting goods and office supplies (9.4 percent), machinery (7.3 percent) and electronic equipment (6.5 percent).The total value of the states exports has nearly doubled since 2005, but what about in the last two years alone? In 2009, exports totaled $1.5 billion. In 2011, they were $2.3 billion, which is in fact a 53-percent increase.With that question answered, we were curious about the reasons for the steep increase.One reason has to do with the global recession. Exports around the world fell at the nadir of the economic downturn. It was no different in Rhode Island, where in 2009 exports plummeted by 24 percent compared with the previous year -- from nearly $2 billion to $1.5 billion. The state made up that ground by 2010 and the number increased again in 2011. Because the states exports had fallen so far, the recent gains were more dramatic than in typical years.Another reason for the high percentage has a similar logic. Rhode Islands exports, at $2.3 billion in value, are low compared with other states, such as Connecticut, where exports totaled $16.2 billion last year, or Massachusetts, with $27.7 billion in exports. So in Rhode Island, a large increase in volume can have an outsize effect in terms of percentage.Meanwhile, Tomasso sent us the presentation put together by the Chafee Center at Bryant, which advises businesses on how to export their products overseas. Not surprisingly, the 53-percent figure in the presentation was based on the same numbers that we found on the ITA website.We called Ray Fogarty, the director of the Chafee Center who also serves as the Rhode Island state trade director. He agreed that the recent increase in exports was more noticeable because the state had fallen so far.In addition, on a national level, many manufacturers are moving their operations back to the United States from overseas as labor and other costs come down. Those companies are then exporting their products, said Fogarty. So that has helped drive the increase in Rhode Island and many other states.We also asked Fogarty why our top export products are waste and scrap. He said the Port of Providence has become a regional shipping hub for scrap metal, with supplies coming in from Massachusetts and Connecticut and other nearby states and then sent to Canada, Turkey, China and other countries.Our rulingTomasso said that exports from Rhode Island have increased by 53 percent over the past two years. According to federal trade statistics, shes correct.That improvement doesnt mean the states economy is set to turn around anytime soon, but it may be a sign of hope.We rate Tomassos claim True.(Get updates fromPolitiFactRI on Twitter.

An Ohio Democrat, he says he supports the ideal of free trade, but adds that poorly drafted trade agreements and weak enforcement of trade rules have let China and other foreign countries step all over American businesses and workers.His backup? Chinas lax labor, safety and environmental standards. Its minuscule wages that make it attractive for manufacturers seeking cheap labor. Its currency manipulation that keeps its export prices artificially low. All of these make it harder for American companies with a domestic workforce to compete, Brown says, yet make China attractive to companies that want to cut labor costs, especially for low-skilled hourly workers.Trade is Browns signature issue.

Hobbs estimates that Oregon producers will see an increase in sales in the $50 million to $100 million range over the next 12 months. That should increase significantly, Hobbs said.We asked Joseph Peterson, the president of Oregon Fruit Products, whether he anticipated a cost reduction for South Korean consumers. He explained that his sell price will stay the same, because the burden of the tariff is borne by the importer, and eventually the consumer.As that duty goes away, the importer's cost will be less, he said. The price reduction should go all the way to the consumer.We called the Office of the United States Trade Representative to see how eliminating a tariff over the longer term usually affects the price of the commodity.Tariff reductions should lower prices of those goods receiving the tariff reductions, Carol Guthrie, an official at the office, said in an e-mail. The price reduction may not equal the tariff reduction on a one-to-one basis (the issue of whether companies fully pass through the savings to the final consumer).If consumer prices have gone up due to inflation, etc over the phase in period, then these prices would have been even higher if the tariffs were not reduced.Already, 2011 has been a landmark year for Oregon blueberries in South Korea. In a separate move, food officials there have authorized for import the first ever fresh blueberries from the United States. Of course, they will come from Oregon.

Following is an excerpt:This is an urgent message! Read this and spread the word! Subject: Foreign Trade Zones. This is unbelievable at first, but you will soon realize that there are several motives for the global communists to physically weave our United States territory together with communist China. Read On! Here's what is going on!Each and every one of our state governors has approved and allocated a certain amount of acres of their U.S. state land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here, supposedly for the purpose of producing Chinese products for sale in the U.S.A. The land the states are giving them for their little towns will be considered foreign territory!!! We are told that the laws of the state (in which these Chinese communists dwell) will apply to the communist Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ). Comment: If so, why are they allowed in here!??! Isn't the whole set up unlawful???  There are 257 of these little communist towns to be built all over the United States.Theres a lot to check in this excerpt, and even more in the parts we didnt reprint. To keep to a reasonable length, we will only look at one part of it -- the idea that Foreign Trade Zones allow land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here.First, a little background about Foreign Trade Zones.In the United States, foreign-trade zones, or FTZs, date to a 1934 act of Congress. FTZs are secure areas located in or near U.S. Customs ports of entry but legally considered to be outside the Customs territory for the purpose of tariff laws and Customs entry procedures. Certain types of merchandise can be imported into the zones without paying import duties or excise taxes. Once there, the merchandise can be stored, assembled, sorted, processed or otherwise manufactured. But duties are paid only when the merchandise is transferred outside the zone and into the U.S. for sale or use.According to the federal board that oversees FTZs, the idea is to improve U.S. competitiveness by encouraging companies to maintain operations in the U.S. FTZs give foreign companies a good reason to locate here and thus use U.S. labor, services and materials. (U.S. companies, for their part, can use FTZs in many other countries around the world, with similar benefits.)So now lets look at some of the claims in the e-mail.The idea that these little towns will be considered foreign territory is false. Aside from tax and tariff rules, FTZs must conform to U.S. laws, not those of the foreign country of the companies operating within them.Meanwhile, the notion that the motive behind FTZs is to physically weave our United States territory together with communist China is ridiculous. Not only are FTZs part of U.S. territory rather than that of a foreign country, but they were signed into law a full 15 years before the Communist Party took over the Chinese government.Most important for our fact check, it is false to say that Chinese communists are to set up little towns and live here, supposedly for the purpose of producing Chinese products for sale in the U.S.A.If you look at the act governing FTZs, it reads: No person shall be allowed to reside within the zone except Federal, State, or municipal officers or agents whose resident presence is deemed necessary by the Board.Nothing has changed that portion of the law in the nearly eight decades since. Afact sheetfrom the U.S. Commerce Department confirms that the FTZ Act prohibits residence within a zone.So lets sum up. Whatever one thinks of the policy benefits of FTZs, the idea put forth by the chain e-mail -- that Foreign Trade Zones allow land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here -- is wrong. FTZs are U.S. territory, and subject to U.S. laws, in every way except for certain tax and duty laws, and in any case, Chinese communists, and almost everyone else, are barred by law from residing in them. The e-mail takes a longstanding part of U.S. law and turns it into a communist plot to take over the country.

Feingold to job creation in China -- not through trade deals, but his vote on the 2009 stimulus package.TheJohnsonadbegins with a narrator saying: Russ Feingold ... desperate ... running a misleading, negative campaign.", "The video pans across headlines from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about PolitiFact Wisconsin items that rated past Feingold claims asHalfTrueandPants on Fire.Then it turns to trade.Feingold says one thing, does another, the ads narrator charges.", "Feingold voted the party line for the stimulus bill that allowed U.S. tax dollars to go to foreign companies to create manufacturing jobs overseas.A large graphic then pops up and lingers -- Create 3,000 jobs in China -- as the narrators says: Democrat senators said the bill will create 3,000 jobs in China alone.So by supporting the stimulus bill, did Feingold sell out his stance on trade and pay for 3,000 jobs in China?Thats a big charge.", "Lets dig in.While there is no question Feingold supported the stimulus bill, the ads claims turn on whether the measure supports overseas jobs in general, and the jobs in China specifically.With the China reference, the ad echoes spots by various congressional candidates across the country that -- according to an Oct. 9, 2010New York Times article-- play on fears about Chinas economic ascendancy.As backup, the Johnson campaign cites two sources: a March 3, 2010pressreleaseby Democratic senators, including Charles Schumer of New York, and astorythe same day by Politico that picked up on the press release.The controversy arose after areportby the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University found that overseas firms had received 79 percent of $2.1 billion in renewable-energy grants under the stimulus plan, as PolitiFact National later recounted.", "That $2.1 billion piece is a tiny portion -- not even 1 percent -- of the overall $787 billion stimulus deal.Only U.S. energy projects can be funded under the stimulus plan, but overseas companies were ahead of America on wind-turbine production, so many of those projects are being developed by the American subsidiaries of foreign companies, PolitiFact National has reported.This detail is glossed over in the ad, which suggests the stimulus money is primarily aimed at creating jobs overseas.The Investigative Reporting Workshop report included reference to a west Texas wind farm proposal that would use made-in-China wind turbines, which would potentially create up to 3,000 jobs in China.", "That prompted Schumer and the other Democrats to condemn that prospect in a news release.The release described the Texas project as  on the verge of receiving $450 million in stimulus funds.That release overstated the case.Newsaccountsat the timequoted projectofficialsin the U.S.-China joint venture assaying they wouldapplyfor stimulus funding, and the China jobs would total 2,400 to 3,000 jobs, with a much smaller number created in the United States.But much has changed since fall 2009, when the project was announced.The outcry over the investigation led to negotiations between the U.S. Steelworkers union and the U.S.-China joint venture.In March 2010, the project announced that its Chinese manufacturing partner would build turbines at a plant in Nevada, creating up to 300 jobs there.", "The plant, which will have other manufacturing uses, could create a total of 1,000 jobs, project officials estimated.In August, 2010, the United Steelworkers announced a deal with the wind-farm partners that they say will assure that major components for the project will be made in the United States.According to United Steelworkers national spokesman Wayne Ranick, under the deal, a total of 1,000 U.S. jobs could be created by establishing a domestic supply chain for the project.", "Wind machines require hundreds of parts and even when key parts are made overseas, much of the work can be done domestically, renewable energy officials say.Project officials now say that a minimum of 70 percent of each wind turbine, including the massive towers and blades, will be wholly manufactured in the United States and made of American steel.Project officials no longer put an estimate on the Chinese manufacturing jobs, saying that the vast majority of all jobs created by the wind farm will be in the United States.Finally, the Texas project, which is in its early stages, has not applied for or received any stimulus funding to date, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.They are eligible to do so, however, and have not ruled out applying later.In any case, the Johnson ad twists the reality of the Democratic news release it cites.", "The senators were opposed to the prospect of the jobs going to China.", "The Johnson ad presents their statement as some

Russ Feingold portraying him as anti-worker for supporting foreign trade deals, Republican challenger Ron Johnson is striking back.In a new TV ad, Johnson tries to tarnish Feingolds pro-labor credentials by casting him as a desperate hypocrite on trade.Where Feingold has touted his opposition to what he calls unfair trade deals with China, Mexico and other countries, the Johnson ad links Feingold to job creation in China -- not through trade deals, but his vote on the 2009 stimulus package.TheJohnsonadbegins with a narrator saying: Russ Feingold ... desperate ... running a misleading, negative campaign. The video pans across headlines from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about PolitiFact Wisconsin items that rated past Feingold claims asHalfTrueandPants on Fire.Then it turns to trade.Feingold says one thing, does another, the ads narrator charges. Feingold voted the party line for the stimulus bill that allowed U.S. tax dollars to go to foreign companies to create manufacturing jobs overseas.A large graphic then pops up and lingers -- Create 3,000 jobs in China -- as the narrators says: Democrat senators said the bill will create 3,000 jobs in China alone.So by supporting the stimulus bill, did Feingold sell out his stance on trade and pay for 3,000 jobs in China?Thats a big charge. Lets dig in.While there is no question Feingold supported the stimulus bill, the ads claims turn on whether the measure supports overseas jobs in general, and the jobs in China specifically.With the China reference, the ad echoes spots by various congressional candidates across the country that -- according to an Oct. 9, 2010New York Times article-- play on fears about Chinas economic ascendancy.As backup, the Johnson campaign cites two sources: a March 3, 2010pressreleaseby Democratic senators, including Charles Schumer of New York, and astorythe same day by Politico that picked up on the press release.The controversy arose after areportby the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University found that overseas firms had received 79 percent of $2.1 billion in renewable-energy grants under the stimulus plan, as PolitiFact National later recounted. That $2.1 billion piece is a tiny portion -- not even 1 percent -- of the overall $787 billion stimulus deal.Only U.S. energy projects can be funded under the stimulus plan, but overseas companies were ahead of America on wind-turbine production, so many of those projects are being developed by the American subsidiaries of foreign companies, PolitiFact National has reported.This detail is glossed over in the ad, which suggests the stimulus money is primarily aimed at creating jobs overseas.The Investigative Reporting Workshop report included reference to a west Texas wind farm proposal that would use made-in-China wind turbines, which would potentially create up to 3,000 jobs in China. That prompted Schumer and the other Democrats to condemn that prospect in a news release.The release described the Texas project as  on the verge of receiving $450 million in stimulus funds.That release overstated the case.Newsaccountsat the timequoted projectofficialsin the U.S.-China joint venture assaying they wouldapplyfor stimulus funding, and the China jobs would total 2,400 to 3,000 jobs, with a much smaller number created in the United States.But much has changed since fall 2009, when the project was announced.The outcry over the investigation led to negotiations between the U.S. Steelworkers union and the U.S.-China joint venture.In March 2010, the project announced that its Chinese manufacturing partner would build turbines at a plant in Nevada, creating up to 300 jobs there. The plant, which will have other manufacturing uses, could create a total of 1,000 jobs, project officials estimated.In August, 2010, the United Steelworkers announced a deal with the wind-farm partners that they say will assure that major components for the project will be made in the United States.According to United Steelworkers national spokesman Wayne Ranick, under the deal, a total of 1,000 U.S. jobs could be created by establishing a domestic supply chain for the project. Wind machines require hundreds of parts and even when key parts are made overseas, much of the work can be done domestically, renewable energy officials say.Project officials now say that a minimum of 70 percent of each wind turbine, including the massive towers and blades, will be wholly manufactured in the United States and made of American steel.Project officials no longer put an estimate on the Chinese manufacturing jobs, saying that the vast majority of all jobs created by the wind farm will be in the United States.Finally, the Texas project, which is in its early stages, has not applied for or received any stimulus funding to date, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.They are eligible to do so, however, and have not ruled out applying later.In any case, the Johnson ad twists the reality of the Democratic news release it cites. The senators were opposed to the prospect of the jobs going to China. The Johnson ad presents their statement as some sort of virtue of the Democratic-backed stimulus plan.The ad also leaves a false impression of Feingolds views on Buy American provisions, including in relation to the stimulus, and on trade with China.Feingold is a longtime advocate of Buy American provisions.In the stimulus debate, it was largely Republicans and business groups, as well as multinational companies and U.S. trading partners, who objected to including strict Buy American rules they viewed as overly protectionist.Feingold voted against aRepublicanamendmentthat would have killed the Buy American provision in its entirety, roll call records show.He did support the compromise version that survived.In the Senate, Feingold has voted consistently against foreign trade agreements he deems as damaging to Wisconsin jobs because he believes they favor foreign competitors.

Johnson tries to bolster this claim by citing a specific Texas project involving China and some 3,000 related jobs to be created there.But he twists Democratic objections to the possibility into alleged support for it.

Bushs budget director.It is indisputable that Portman supported Bushs proposal to allow Americans to put part of their Social Security contributions into private accounts.", "Americans would be able to invest in stocks, bonds, government securities or stay out of the accounts entirely.I mean, this is what Einstein talked about, the magic, the greatest force in the universe, the power of compounding interest, Portman, then a congressman, said in a House Budget Committee hearing in 2005.", "That's what we're talking about here.Its easy today to see how badly a Wall Street downturn would affect that magic in the short term.", "But that oversimplifies the case.", "Bush and congressional Republicans made their strongest push for privatization  they preferred to refer to it as private accounts  in 2005 but did not intend for such a program to start right away.", "Portman noted at a news conference in early 2007, when he was Bushs budget director, that the president had already pushed back the proposed start date to 2010, and then in 2007 he pushed it back again to 2012.At the time, Portman said the accounts would be strictly voluntary and comprise only a portion of anyones Social Security savings.", "Furthermore, Portman said in 1999, when the subject was in its incubation phase, that there must be a safety net for everybody so that no ones Social Security benefits would be reduced.", "This might have required a taxpayer bailout if stock market losses packed a wallop, but thats not the issue here.Still, Portman was unquestionably a privatization champion, saying in 2005 that it was reasonable to expect a 5 percent annual return on investment, which I think is conservative.", "But thats not the same as having a current plan to tax, slash and privatize these benefits, as the Fisher campaign suggests Portman has now.Asked about any such plan, the Portman campaign said it hasnt developed one.", "Portman has only said that everything must be on the table when discussing entitlement reform.", "That could put Portman at odds with AARP, which says that solutions must not come at the expense of today's seniors and future generations.", "But it puts Portman on the same page as President Barack Obama , who said in April when naming a commission to address this nations debt: Everything has to be on the table.Collins, the Fisher spokesman, suggests this is a cop-out for Portman because right out of the gate, Portman includes the potential of tax increases, benefit cuts, or both.", "His plan includes an open discussion of taxing and slashing benefits, Collins said.", "And our plan would not start with that.", "We would not consider that.Portman has in fact said that Social Securitys solvency might require pain, although he viewed private accounts as better alternative.", "Otherwise, he said in 2005, We're going to have to raise taxes, we're going to have to borrow, we're going to have to cut benefits -- we're going to have to do something.In an interview with Human Events Online, Portman later said that private accounts would over the long term deal with the solvency issue.That was then, this is now -- and Portman has not mentioned private accounts in a long time or talked about whether his views have changed.", "He only says that with deficit, debt and entitlement problems growing, the nation needs a serious discussion.", "To get everyone to the table, says his spokeswoman, Jessica Towhey, Portman believes that no possible solutions should be eliminated out of hand.As for the possible fears of seniors or anyone hoping to retire, she notes that as a congressman, Portman voted in 2000 to reduce the percentage of Social Security benefits subject to taxes.", "He voted in 1995 to repeal a tax increase on Social Security benefits.", "And he voted in 1996 to allow beneficiaries to earn more outside income without losing their Social Security benefits.The claim against Portman has a substantial short-coming.", "Agreeing to hear others out is not the same as agreeing to slash or tax.", "And favoring privatization before, in a dramatically different economic climate, is not the same as pushing for it now.It would be credible to cite Portmans past actions and question what he might do now.", "But in saying that Portman has a plan to do so, the claim becomes Barely True.", "Comment on this item."], "issues": ["Ohio", "Bush Administration", "Economy", "Trade"], "image_data": [], "data": [{"sentence": "Comment on this item.", "hrefs": "http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/07/fisher_campaign_claim_that_por.html"}], "label": "barely-true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2010/jun/07/john-kerry/kerry-says-us-imports-more-oil-now-911/", "title": "We now actually import more oil than we did before 9/11.", "author": "Louis Jacobson", "posted": "06/07/2010", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["During a June 6, 2010, appearance on ABC'sThis Week, Sen.

Bill White used D.C. connections from his job in the Clinton administration to form a company that did business in the Middle East and defaulted on a $60 million loan.Those are several facts worth checking.", "To avoid a confusing pile-up, let's break Perry's statement into these parts: White's job in D.C., the connections it may have given him, and the international oil and gas company White started to explore in the Caspian Sea region -- not in the Middle East, contrary to what Perry says.To support the video statement, the Perry campaign provided us with news reports from five outlets, including The Houston Chronicle and a magazine, Azerbaijan International.White's DC jobWhite's resume reflects decades spent as a lawyer, businessman and government employee.", "Most recently, he served for six years as the mayor of Houston.Perry's statement reflects back to the mid-1990s, when White served for about two years as deputy U.S. energy secretary in President Bill Clinton's administration.In his book The Oil and the Glory: The Pursuit of Empire and Fortune on the Caspian Sea, journalist Steve LeVine calls White one of the Clinton administration's pioneers of Caspian policy-making and says he helped put Caspian oil on Washington's agenda.According to a February 2003 story in the Houston Press, an alternative newspaper: During his tenure as deputy energy secretary in the mid-'90s, White repeatedly visited the Caspian Sea area, where he met with Azerbaijan President Haidar Aliyev and Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia to discuss energy deals with Western companies.Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White, said that while he was deputy energy secretary, White traveled to the Caspian Sea region about six times, including at least three visits to Azerbaijan and two to Georgia.Denying that his interest in the region was financial, White told the Press then:  I had an interest in the former Soviet Union before I went into government, during government and after government.", "I thought it was critically important that the United States and the whole West try to teach good models of free enterprise over there.FronteraWhite left his federal post in August 1995 and the next year helped found Houston-based Frontera Resources, which set its sights on emerging markets like the Caspian Sea.", "That resource-rich region was the site of an oil rush after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.A May 1997 item in the Houston Press said that after White left his energy post, he and Lan Bentsen, son of former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, immediately founded Frontera Resources and went into Azerbaijan and the neighboring state of Georgia.Time out for a geography lesson.", "Those two places -- along with Bolivia, the only countries where Frontera has operated -- are former Soviet republics in the Caucasus, a region just north of the Middle East.Did White use Washington connections from his federal experience to form Frontera, as Perry says?Several published accounts, including a 2003 Houston Chronicle story sent to us by Perry's campaign, characterize the formation of the company that way.", "Some of those articles note that Lloyd Bentsen, who served as Clinton's Treasury secretary in 1993 and 1994, was an investor in the company; White told us recently that he knew Bentsen before his stint as a federal official.White also said the other co-founders of the company, Bentsen's son, Lan, and Steve Nicandros, who came to Frontera from a job as head of international business development for Conoco, didn't reflect connections he made in Washington.", "Bacon said White's wife introduced him to Lan Bentsen.We visited with White about the 1997 form filed with the Texas secretary of state's office to form the company and wondered about two other officers listed as vice presidents.", "He told us that he'd worked with Reginal Spiller and Robert Berls at the Department of Energy.", "White said he recruited Spiller, a geologist, to the department from Maxus Energy and that Spiller became vice president of exploration and production at Frontera.", "White said he hired Berls, an expert on the former Soviet Union, to work at the Energy Department on the recommendation of senior officials at the Defense Department.LeVine, the Oil and Glory author, told us that it wasn't White's political connections in Washington that were key to the Frontera enterprise, but contacts farther afield.", "It's the political connections that he made on the Caspian Sea as a D.C. official that gave him the entree there, said Levine.", "He didn't need contacts in Washington.", "...", "He was the contact.LeVine said: There is no doubt that Bill relied on senior-level contacts as deputy energy secretary to have the entree to obtain the energy acreage that Frontera got in Georgia and in Azerbaijan.", "You cannot say flatly that none of that would have happened absent him, but having met the presidents of both countries numerous times, you know, that's how business is done.For his part, White called Perry's overall statement ridiculous.", "He pointed to his deep background in oil and gas and energy-related fields and said he had many (employment) alternatives when he left the Energy Department.", "He also said the first money invested in the company was his own and noted that Nicandros, the company's current chairman and CEO, had been a leader in the oil and gas industry before coming to Frontera.Still, White acknowledged that his experiences as a federal energy official who traveled to the region had played a role in Frontera's business, saying: They helped me in making the assessment that these countries would not expropriate the oil and gas concessions.Translation: White's administration experience helped the company assess the political and economic stability of the nations in which Frontera would do business.White was chief executive of Frontera until 1997, when he became president and chief operating officer of the Wedge Group, a private Houston holding company with interests in oil service companies, commercial real estate and hotels, according to a February article in the Austin American-Statesman.", "White remained chairman of Frontera's board until 2001.He no longer has any role at the company, although his most recent financial disclosure form, filed with the Texas Ethics Commission on Feb. 16, says he holds 10,000 or more shares of Frontera stock, which trades on the London stock exchange and on the unregulated over-the-counter market in the U.S. A March 31 audit report performed for the company by PriceWaterhouseCoopers says it has suffered recurring losses from operations and has limited available funds ... which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.Bacon said White's shares are worth about $11,000.The loan In 1998, Frontera entered into an agreement with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan to develop oil fields there.", "In 2000, Frontera announced that it would receive $60 million in loans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was created as communism crumbled in 1991 to support private sector growth in central Europe and central Asia.Problems developed in 2001, said Frontera spokeswoman Liz Williamson, when the state oil company halted exports of oil from the project.", "This led to a dispute between the companies, Williamson said, which triggered a violation of a loan covenant causing Frontera to default under the terms of certain financing agreements with the bank, which did not immediately respond to our queries.Williamson said the bank then foreclosed.", "The following year, Frontera's interest in the Azerbaijan project was sold for $53 million, and the loan was repaid.Frontera continues to operate in Georgia.Summing up: Perry is right that White worked in the Clinton administration and that he later formed a company that defaulted on a $60 million loan.", "He's off the mark, however, when he says that the company did business in the Middle East.As for whether White used D.C. connections to form Frontera, as Perry says, that's true in only the baldest sense.", "Yes, White worked in Washington when he made key contacts overseas that surely helped him with Frontera.", "And he recruited two federal underlings to the venture.", "But
