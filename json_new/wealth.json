everybody up and we'll be competitive with other states.", "So that's my approach for dealing with it, not changing rates and not charging our more successful folks more money.", "I think the middle

for the rich.", "That sparked an immediate request from a few readers to have PolitiFact Rhode Island check his assertion.", "One reason: in 2010, the General Assembly, when Mattiello was House Majority Leader, lowered the top tax rate for the state's highest earners.", "That rate was 9.9 percent for income that exceeded $336,550 and in state-by-state rankings, it stood out like stink bomb at a flower show.", "So the legislature, with the blessing of then-Governor Donald Carcieri, brought the top rate down to 5.99 percent.", "Thus was born the idea that Rhode Island had given a big tax break for the rich, promptingcalls by some legislators to bump the rate upto 7.99 percent for all earnings above $250,000.", "But, as in all things taxes, it's not that simple.", "We'll return to the 2010 changes.", "But first we should travel further back to 2006, a year before Mattiello joined the General Assembly and the year a tax overhaul passed that was designed to increasingly benefit the wealthy Instead of the top tax rate of 9.9 percent, the legislature and then-Governor Donald Carcieri gave taxpayers the option of paying a flat 8.0 percent of their adjusted gross income if they gave up taking credits and deductions.", "Each subsequent year, that tax cap dropped another 0.5 percentage points.", "It would have fallen to 5.5 percent if the General Assembly hadn't done its 2010 tax

Massachusetts and see a 5.3 percent income tax, Connecticut with a 5.0 percent tax, and Rhode Island with a 9.9 percent tax.", "They make a choice on where to move and create jobs, and that difference in tax rates is a big factor in the choice they make.", "So this was clearly an effort to entice the rich and bring them to -- or keep them in -- Rhode Island.", "In each succeeding year, as the percentage fell, more well-off taxpayers took advantage of it.", "So by the time the 2010 tax law lowering the top rate was passed, many of the rich weren't paying taxes at the 9.9 percent rate anyway.", "On the other side of the ledger, in 2009 the rich took a hit when the legislature approved another bill, one that taxed capital gains, which is the profit from the sale of stocks and other investments, as regular income.", "Capital gains had been taxed at a special reduced rate.", "Now back to the 2010 legislation, and the tax rates now in effect.", "Those tax changes did more than lower the top rate.", "It rejiggered the whole tax structure.", "Instead of the 9.9 percent rate kicking in for income that exceeded $336,550, the new 5.99 percent rate applied to all income above $135,000.", "Five levels of taxation were transformed into three.", "The standard deduction went up.", "So did the personal exemption.", "The legislation also phased out most credits and itemized deductions as a person's  income rose, and shifted some of the tax burden to non-residents.", "When we asked Mattiello's office about the Speaker's claim, Berman sent us a projection from the state's Office of Revenue Analysis done when the changes were being considered.", "It used tax data from 2008 and compared what people would pay under the old and new systems.", "We also looked at a later analysis done at the end of 2010, after passage.", "Both showed the same pattern.", "Here are the December 2010 numbers: Adjusted gross income Change in average tax paid Number of returns $1 to

(representing about 8 percent of filers) paid $574 extra compared to what they would have paid under the previous system.", "So the rich did not get a big tax break from this law.", "Finally, there was a major change in the estate tax that passed in 2014.", "Under the old system, if an estate was worth $921,655 or less, no estate tax was assessed.", "But if the value was even a dollar higher, the full value of the estate was taxed.", "Under the 2014 change, the tax only kicks in when the estate is valued at more than $1.5 million.", "More importantly, the all-or-nothing provision, sometimes called the cliff,  was eliminated and only the portion in excess of $1.5 million is subject to the tax.", "In addition, the limit is now tied to inflation.", "The change translates into a collective tax savings of $64,400 to the heirs of someone whose estate is worth more than $1.5 million.", "The degree to which this change benefited the rich is a matter of debate.", "If you believe, to paraphrase Mitt Romney, Estates are people too, than this was a big tax break for the wealthy, saving them up to $64,400 in taxes per estate.", "In addition, supporters of the proposal said it

percentage points -- is often regarded as a tax cut for the rich, but the wealthy actually paid more.", "They also paid more after the 2009 change, which called for taxing capital gains as ordinary income.", "But we only had to go back to 2006 to find tax legislation that argues against his point.", "Although no longer in effect, it imposed an ever-lower cap on state taxes that benefitted more and more rich people as the tax cap dropped lower and lower.", "And the 2014  change in the estate tax meant that wealthier estates weren't taxed as heavily.", "Overall, we believe the rich

growing number of baby boomers swelling the retirement rolls, there's concern that the Social Security trust will run out of money.There are several proposals for extending the life of the fund. To mark an Aug. 15 visit to a group of East Providence seniors, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's office issued a news release mentioning one of them. We found it on his website.For Social Security, which is projected to remain solvent through 2033, Whitehouse has cosponsored the Keeping Our Social Security Promises Act, which would raise the cap on Social Security payroll taxes to include income over $250,000. By doing so, the bill would extend the life of the program by an additional 75 years.We had seen a different projection for when the Social Security trust fund is expected to run out of money. We also wondered if something as simple as lifting the payroll tax cap would provide a funding solution through 2108.We were right. The projection has changed, and not for the better.According to the2011 Annual Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund Reports, the interest earned from investing trust fund money into U.S. Treasury bonds -- combined with money collected each year from Social Security taxes -- will cover the costs of the program through 2022. After that, Social Security will have to start tapping the principal as well as the interest. That principal will be depleted in 2036.But those numbers are outdated.Whitehouse was actually citing the key number fromthe 2012 reportshowing that, as a result of the bad economy, Social Security is draining its trust fund faster than before.Interest from investments will stop covering the costs of the program in 2021 (not 2022) and the fund's assets will be exhausted by 2033 (not 2036).So Whitehouse was correct on that count.Now let's talk about his plan to save it.Under the current system, Social Security is financed by a flat income tax of 12.4 percent on the self-employed. For people who are employed, the worker and the employer split the tax.But there's a limit to the amount a person can be taxed. Once a person's income hits $106,800, the tax is frozen. (That $106,800 ceiling goes up as average U.S. wages rise.) Thus, a person earning $106 million annually pays the same amount as someone earning $106,800.The Whitehouse proposal would remove that cap, but in a somewhat complicated way.Under the current system, a self-employed person earning $300,000 in 2011 would have paid the Social Security tax only on the first $106,800 of income.If the Whitehouse proposal had been in place for the 2011 tax year, that same individual would have paid the tax on the first $106,800andon any income over $250,000but noton income between $106,800 to $250,000.Why the gap? Because President Obama promised not to raises taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. (If the $106,800 cap grew to $250,000, the gap would disappear.)That change would add a lot of cash to the system. But would it be enough to finance Social Security into the next century?When we contacted Whitehouse's office, spokesman Seth Larson said the wording on the press release had been unclear. Changing the law to lift the cap would not extend the solvency of the trust fund for 75 years beyond 2033. It would keep the program solvent for 75 years beginning now.Larson said, 75 years is as far as the actuary projects when looking at long-term solvency.To back that up, he sent usa letterfrom the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration.In fact, that report, which uses numbers from 2010, does say the proposal would keep Social Security solvent for the next 75 years by raising an estimated $6.5 trillion dollars during that period.

Michael McCaul, R-Texas) to a low of $6.21 million (Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Texas).Twenty-nine of the lawmakers on the 50 wealthiest list were House members and 21 were senators. If one uses this list as a benchmark for deciding which lawmakers are wealthy, as Duncan apparently did, then just 6 percent of the 435 House members would be considered wealthy.But is that really a fair measure of wealth? Is $6.21 million  the estimated net worth of the least  affluent member on the 50 wealthiest list  really the cut-off point at which most Americans would consider someone to be wealthy?Given that the median net wealth for the country at large was $96,000 in 2009, according to theFederal Reserve,we wondered how an economist would define wealthy.We put that question to Scott Winship, a fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, and Josh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Both institutes are left-leaning think tanks in Washington.Winship pointed out that Federal Reserve data shows the top 10 percent of wealthiest Americans in 2007 had a net worth of at least $971,000. That equates to roughly $1 million in 2010 dollars, so if you want to look at the entry point to the top 10 percent of wealth as your definition of wealthy, you can use $1 million as an easy cut-off, Winship said.Bivens, however, suggested a better measure might be the top 5 percent of wealthiest Americans, who had a net wealth of at least $1.8 million in 2007.When we apply the $1 million benchmark suggested by Winship, it's clear that members are Congress are much wealthier than average Americans.The Center for Responsive Politics says its analysis of financial disclosure statements, released on Nov. 15, 2011, shows that 250 current members of the House and Senate are millionaires. In the House, 183 members -- or 42 percent -- had an average net worth in excess of $1 million in 2010.Applying the $1.8 million benchmark suggested by Bivens, the numbers drop, but not by much -- 137 House members, or 31 percent, had an average net worth of at least $1.8 million.For the record, Duncan says the Center for Responsive Politics latest rankings came out after he had finished his newsletter. But he reiterated his belief that using both minimum and maximum figures makes Congress members appear far wealthier than they really are.We concede that the centers use of an average range could skew numbers, but 435 is a large enough sample size to conclude that aberrations would balance out -- where one members net worth could be exaggerated, anothers could be understated.Duncans net worth, by the way, ranged from $169,022 at the low end, $660,000 on the high end and the mid-range estimate hitting $414,511. And, again, the numbers do not include the value of a members primary residence.Our rulingWhile it is difficult to get an exact measure of congressional riches, House and Senate members are clearly much better off financially than the average American. Roughly one-third of House members, or 31 percent, have an average net worth not including their primary residence of at least $1.8 million, putting them among the 5 percent of wealthiest Americans.  Even more, 42 percent, have a net worth in excess of $1 million.Under either measure, Duncans claim that fewer than 10 percent of House members are wealthy is way off base. We rate this claim False.", "hrefs": "http://duncan.house.gov/December%202011%20Newsletterpdf.pdf"}], "label": "false"}]
