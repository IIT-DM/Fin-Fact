he also has not endorsed the bill.Brown has bluntly stated that unless the (carbon emissions bill's) authors agree to a variety of manufacturing and trade provisions, there is little possibility that the legislation will get anywhere near enough support to clear the Senate, the article said.Clean energy legislation is not just about the environment, it's about creating jobs and revitalizing our nation's manufacturing basis, Brown said.", "For a clean energy bill to be successful, it must also be a jobs bill that partners with the business community.In early 2011, with no legislation on the table, The Plain Dealer reported that Brown and the coal industry both are trying in their own ways to stop President Barack Obama's administration from imposing rules this year on new or upgraded power plants and large factories that use coal because, both say, the rules would hurt Ohio manufacturers and consumers.What's the capper on the ad's claim?The Mandel ad labeled Brown an Obama rubberstamp for supporting the job-killing cap and trade plan.Well leave the phrase job-killing to those who debate policy.", "As a statement of opinion, PolitiFact Ohio wont rate it.Regardless, the statement is not accurate.", "Rather, it invokes the fear of a proposed system for limiting emissions that Congress could never agree on and to this day does not exist.Brown has expressed support for some form of emissions controls and has said that under the right conditions, he would support cap-and-trade legislation.", "But its also clear that he had reservations about the legislation that has been before the Senate.When the 2009 bill was pending, Brown never endorsed it.", "He bluntly stated that unless the (carbon emissions bill's) authors agree to a variety of manufacturing and trade provisions, there is little possibility that the legislation will get anywhere near enough support to clear the Senate, according to The New York Times.", "That bill stalled in the Senate and died without a final vote.In 2008, prior to Obama becoming president, Brown joined Republicans and voted to block a bill that would have created a cap-and-trade system of credits for carbon dioxide emissions.That is far from being a rubber stamp on the issue.On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim in the radio ad rates False."], "issues": ["Environment", "Ohio", "Cap and Trade", "Climate Change",

Pelosi says.No, Gingrich answers, but we do agree: Our country must take action to address climate change.Pelosi: We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast.Gingrich: If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need.The ad directs viewers to the website WeCanSolveIt.org, with the final words from Pelosi, Together, we can do this.The commercial was created by a climate-change awareness organization now known as the Climate Reality Project, which former vice president Al Gore founded. (WeCanSolveIt.org is the old name of the site now calledClimateRealityProject.org.)Gingrich and Pelosi were asked to do the bit as part of a larger campaign featuring unlikely pairs who can agree on the need to act on climate change, Gore said in aninterviewwith The Young Turks, an online news show, in December 2011.Gingrich has since renounced the collaboration, saying in a Fox News interview in November that it was probably the dumbest single thing I've ever done. A section of his website called Answering the Attacks says, Newt absolutely opposes 'cap and trade' as well as any system of taxing carbon emissions.What is cap and trade? The idea is that the government sets a limit (the cap) on how much carbon different companies can emit. The government then issues permits to businesses - typically electric utilities and manufacturers - and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those that lower emissions most effectively.The Gingrich and Pelosi ad didn't specifically mention cap and trade, but our previous research has shown Gingrichsupported cap and tradeas recently as 2007. Romney said that Gingrich was sitting on the couch encouraging cap and trade, but Gingrich didn't specifically mention the policy in that ad.This brings us to the second part of the claim, that while Gingrich was couch sitting, Romney was fighting against cap and trade.Like Gingrich, Romneyhas changedhis public statements on cap and trade. As Massachusetts governor in 2003, Romney joined in support of a compact among several northeastern states to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. In a letter to then-New York Gov. George Pataki, he said, I concur that climate change is beginning to affect our natural resources and that now is the time to take action toward climate protection.The Economistnamed him a Climate-Friendly Republican in 2004.But in 2005, the same day he announced he would not seek re-election, Romney abruptly pulled out of the regional cap-and-trade agreement. He told theNew York Timesthe pact did not protect businesses and consumers from increased energy costs. Environmental advocates fumed.Let's recap: Gingrich certainly appeared in a 2008 video with Pelosi and said we must take action to address climate change. He didn't specifically promote cap and trade, though he had supported it in the past. It's also true that Romney rejected what was hailed as a landmark regional cap-and-trade agreement among several northeastern states in 2005 -- although it came after two years of him touting its merit. Both facets of Romney's claim are factual, though they did not occur simultaneously, as his use while would suggest. They actually were three years apart.

claims:Evidence points toward climate change being primarily a natural, rather than man-made, phenomenon.The science about the causes of global climate change is in dispute.To check the first claim, we turned to the most recentreportby theU.N.", "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), a scientific body considered the leading international organization on climate science.", "Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, the 2007 report states.", "The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone.", "(External forcing refers to anything that changes the climate that is outside of the normal climate system.", ")In the United States, theU.S.", "Global Change Research Programcoordinates and integrates federal research on climate.", "Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCCs conclusions: Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal.", "The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases.", "These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.The IPCC reportstatesthat the period from 1995 to 2006 contains 11 of the 12 warmest years on record since instrumental measurement began in 1850.", "It concluded that global surface temperature rose 0.76 degrees Celsius from the end of the 19th century (1850-1899) to the beginning of the 21st (2001-2005).", "The U.S.", "Global Change Research Programs report similarly found that the average global temperature increase by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900.While these temperature changes may sound small, keep in mind that these are averages.", "The rise in temperature, and its visible effects, are more pronounced in certain parts of the world than in others.", "The polar ice sheets are particularly vulnerable to temperature increases.", "Greenlandlost36 to 60 cubic miles of ice from 2002 to 2006 while Antarctica lost 36 cubic miles of ice during roughly the same time period.Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami, was one of the many scientific contributors to the 2007 IPCC report.The rise in global mean temperature since the 19th century may seem small, and projections of global mean warming over the next century range from 2 to 5 degrees Celsius, Soden said.", "One way to put these numbers into perspective is to realize that the current climate is now only about 5 degrees Celsius warmer than it was during the last glacial maximum (approximately 20,000 years ago) when ice covered much of North America extending all the way down to St Louis.If youve been following the debate recently, you may remember that climate research on temperature was called into question in 2009 when stolen e-mails from the Climatic Research United at the University of East Anglia were released on the Internet.", "Global warming skeptics said the e-mails showed climate researchers were manipulating data.But several inquiries debunked those allegations, including those conducted by theBritish Parliament, theU.S.", "Department of Commerce,Pennsylvania State University, and theInterAcademy Council.", "The inquiries found that while the scientists had made rude remarks about people who questioned climate change, they were not falsifying data.", "A few reports recommended greater transparency and sharing of climatic data, but the independent investigations exonerated the researchers of falsifying data.We looked into the work of the most prominent and best credentialed people who have questioned the IPCCs conclusions on global warming.", "Generally speaking, even these scientistsdo not claimthat humans are making no contribution at all to rising temperatures.", "Rather, they tend to make more nuanced points.", "They question whether carbon emissions alone are driving up temperatures, or whetherother human activities contributeas well.", "They question whether extreme weather events such as storms or floods can be conclusively linked to rising temperatures.", "And, they question whethersignificant changes to public policyare necessary as a means of coping with rising temperatures.For Pawlentys second claim -- that there is dispute about the causes of climate change -- we decided to look at the opinions of world scientists about the issue.Several studies have attempted to quantify how much agreement there is among scientists when it comes to climate change.A  2010studypublished in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences- the official publication of theUnited States National Academy of Sciences- found that out of 1,372 climate researchers surveyed, approximately 97 to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing the climate change, which they term anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) climate change.", "It also concluded that the relative climate expertise andscientic prominence of the researchers unconvinced of man-made climate change are substantially below that of the convinced researchers.An earliersurveypublished in the 2009 issue ofEos-- a publication of theAmerican Geophysical Union-- surveyed scientists from a wide range of disciplines (approximately 3,146) and asked: Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?", "Approximately 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered yes to this question.", "Of those climate change specialists surveyed, 97.4 percent answered yes to this question.Climate change skeptics have their own petition, commonly called the Oregon petition, that has been endorsed by31,000 signersopposing restrictions on carbon emissions.", "But that petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or proving that the signatories exist.To be clear, were not saying that no scientists dispute man-made climate change.", "When we contacted the Pawlenty campaign, they pointed us to several published pieces, such as writings byJohn R. Christy, who was counted as a dissenting researcher as part of the 2010 study from theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.But these skeptics seem to be a small -- even tiny -- minority, in contrast to Pawlentys comments suggesting significant disagreement.", "Many of the skeptics agree that climate change is occurring and that human activities play a part.", "But they disagree with some of the conclusions formulated in mainstream climate science.To summarize: Based on our research, there is very little dispute in the scientific community, especially among climate specialists, on whether climate change is primarily caused by natural or man-made forces.", "The overwhelming majority of scientists polled feel that human activity is the primary driver of climate change.", "Also, based on scientific studies by the IPCC and others, global warming over the past 50 years has been primarily driven by human activity.Based upon the preponderance of evidence we conclude that Tim Pawlentys claims are both incorrect and misleading to the public, who may not be familiar with the science behind climate change.", "It is not fair to say the science is in dispute, as if there are good arguments on both sides.", "Rather, there is significant scientific consensus that human beings are contributing to global warming.", "We rate his statement False.", "Editor's Note: Pawlenty announced he was dropping out of the presidential race on Aug. 14.", "Also, this report was changed to reflect a more expansive definition of external forcing."], "issues": ["Environment", "National", "Cap and Trade", "Climate Change", "Energy"], "image_data": [], "data": [{"sentence": "Climate change has become a touchy subject in the Republican primary.

Its something we have to look to the science on. The weight of the evidence is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes... Theres lots of layers to it. But at least as to any potential man-made contribution to it, its fair to say the science is in dispute.We divided Pawlentys answer into his two essential claims:Evidence points toward climate change being primarily a natural, rather than man-made, phenomenon.The science about the causes of global climate change is in dispute.To check the first claim, we turned to the most recentreportby theU.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), a scientific body considered the leading international organization on climate science. Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, the 2007 report states. The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone. (External forcing refers to anything that changes the climate that is outside of the normal climate system.)In the United States, theU.S. Global Change Research Programcoordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCCs conclusions: Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.The IPCC reportstatesthat the period from 1995 to 2006 contains 11 of the 12 warmest years on record since instrumental measurement began in 1850. It concluded that global surface temperature rose 0.76 degrees Celsius from the end of the 19th century (1850-1899) to the beginning of the 21st (2001-2005).  The U.S. Global Change Research Programs report similarly found that the average global temperature increase by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900.While these temperature changes may sound small, keep in mind that these are averages. The rise in temperature, and its visible effects, are more pronounced in certain parts of the world than in others. The polar ice sheets are particularly vulnerable to temperature increases. Greenlandlost36 to 60 cubic miles of ice from 2002 to 2006 while Antarctica lost 36 cubic miles of ice during roughly the same time period.Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami, was one of the many scientific contributors to the 2007 IPCC report.The rise in global mean temperature since the 19th century may seem small, and projections of global mean warming over the next century range from 2 to 5 degrees Celsius, Soden said. One way to put these numbers into perspective is to realize that the current climate is now only about 5 degrees Celsius warmer than it was during the last glacial maximum (approximately 20,000 years ago) when ice covered much of North America extending all the way down to St Louis.If youve been following the debate recently, you may remember that climate research on temperature was called into question in 2009 when stolen e-mails from the Climatic Research United at the University of East Anglia were released on the Internet. Global warming skeptics said the e-mails showed climate researchers were manipulating data.But several inquiries debunked those allegations, including those conducted by theBritish Parliament, theU.S. Department of Commerce,Pennsylvania State University, and theInterAcademy Council. The inquiries found that while the scientists had made rude remarks about people who questioned climate change, they were not falsifying data. A few reports recommended greater transparency and sharing of climatic data, but the independent investigations exonerated the researchers of falsifying data.We looked into the work of the most prominent and best credentialed people who have questioned the IPCCs conclusions on global warming. Generally speaking, even these scientistsdo not claimthat humans are making no contribution at all to rising temperatures. Rather, they tend to make more nuanced points. They question whether carbon emissions alone are driving up temperatures, or whetherother human activities contributeas well. They question whether extreme weather events such as storms or floods can be conclusively linked to rising temperatures. And, they question whethersignificant changes to public policyare necessary as a means of coping with rising temperatures.For Pawlentys second claim -- that there is dispute about the causes of climate change -- we decided to look at the opinions of world scientists about the issue.Several studies have attempted to quantify how much agreement there is among scientists when it comes to climate change.A  2010studypublished in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences- the official publication of theUnited States National Academy of Sciences- found that out of 1,372 climate researchers surveyed, approximately 97 to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing the climate change, which they term anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) climate change.  It also concluded that the relative climate expertise andscientic prominence of the researchers unconvinced of man-made climate change are substantially below that of the convinced researchers.An earliersurveypublished in the 2009 issue ofEos-- a publication of theAmerican Geophysical Union-- surveyed scientists from a wide range of disciplines (approximately 3,146) and asked: Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures? Approximately 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered yes to this question. Of those climate change specialists surveyed, 97.4 percent answered yes to this question.Climate change skeptics have their own petition, commonly called the Oregon petition, that has been endorsed by31,000 signersopposing restrictions on carbon emissions. But that petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or proving that the signatories exist.To be clear, were not saying that no scientists dispute man-made climate change. When we contacted the Pawlenty campaign, they pointed us to several published pieces, such as writings byJohn R. Christy, who was counted as a dissenting researcher as part of the 2010 study from theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.But these skeptics seem to be a small -- even tiny -- minority, in contrast to Pawlentys comments suggesting significant disagreement. Many of the skeptics agree that climate change is occurring and that human activities play a part. But they disagree with some of the conclusions formulated in mainstream climate science.To summarize: Based on our research, there is very little dispute in the scientific community, especially among climate specialists, on whether climate change is primarily caused by natural or man-made forces. The overwhelming majority of scientists polled feel that human activity is the primary driver of climate change. Also, based on scientific studies by the IPCC and others, global warming over the past 50 years has been primarily driven by human activity.Based upon the preponderance of evidence we conclude that Tim Pawlentys claims are both incorrect and misleading to the public, who may not be familiar with the science behind climate change.  It is not fair to say the science is in dispute, as if there are good arguments on both sides. Rather, there is significant scientific consensus that human beings are contributing to global warming.

Newark brewery had solar panels installed on its roof.A May 17, 2010 news release issued by Anheuser-Busch announcing the installation said more than 3,000 photovoltaic solar panels, covering 65,000 square feet, would be capable, at peak production, of covering nearly five percent of the brewery's electricity demand.", "Orion Energy Systems installed and operate the solar panels, according to the

project swaying the company to stay in New Jersey.So the brewery had solar panels installed on its roof, but did the beer company receive RGGI funds for the project?Tittel said his statement was based on a conversation he had with Al Komjathy, a lobbyist with the firm Komjathy & Stewart, which represents Anheuser-Busch, among other companies.But Komjathy said he never spoke with Tittel about the issue.", "I never had that discussion with him, he told PolitiFact New Jersey.And Anheuser-Busch told us in a statement: Our Newark brewery did not receive funding from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for the solar panel project and there were no plans to relocate the brewery.Its worth noting that Anheuser-Busch applied for funding for a cogeneration power plant at its Newark brewery through the Clean Energy Solutions Capital Investment initiative, a financing program funded by RGGI proceeds and controlled by the state Economic Development Authority.", "Laura Jones, a spokeswoman

renewable energy certificates produced by the solar panels, according to PSEG spokesman Fran Sullivan.Tittel said he was referring to Section 13 in the RGGI law -- the section allows electric and utility companies to charge ratepayers for investments they make in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.However, a spokesman for the state Board of Public Utilities  told us that because PSEG Power is not regulated, Section 13 does not apply.Lets recap.Tittel claimed one of the reasons Anheuser-Buschs Budweiser brewery in Newark stayed in New Jersey is because they received funding

Diane Allen (R-Burlington/Camden) cited Ocean Spray's move as an example of how the RGGI was hurting the state's businesses.As a former president and CEO of a small business, I can attest to the impact rising energy rates have on an employers ability to add jobs and expand, she said in a May 9 news release.", "Just ask Ocean Spray, which last week announced it will be moving its Bordentown processing facility to Pennsylvania, in large measure due to the costs associated with RGGI.PolitiFact New Jersey dug into her claim and quickly found it didn't have much juice: Five news articles and two TV segments about Ocean Spray's move didnt mention any connection between the decision and RGGI.We checked with Adam Bauer, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, who said Allens comments were based on information she received from longtime cranberry grower Bill Haines Jr.", "According to Ocean Spray, Haines served on the Ocean Spray board of directors between 1996 and 1999, and then again in 2002.Haines never called us back, so we asked Ocean Spray.Company spokesman John Isaf said in an email that higher energy rates factored into the decision to leave Bordentown, but not the RGGI program or its contribution to the rate.The decision, he said, was based on a variety of factors -- lower energy costs, improved transportation and distribution (warehousing/freight) logistics; proximity to supply chain partners and customers; lower labor costs; other utility cost advantages (water/wastewater/gas); and a more efficient and modern infrastructure and facility, Isaf said in the statement.While energy costs were one of several considerations that went into our decision, and NJs costs are significantly higher than other states, we were looking at the total rate paid, not the RGGI program or its contribution to the rate, Isaf said.That's enough for the Truth-O-Meter, but we thought it was also worth exploring the senator's underlying point, that the cap-and-trade portion is driving up electricity costs.Utility representatives and experts have an answer: not so much.According to Karen Johnson, spokeswoman for Public Service Electric and Gas, which supplies power to the Bordentown area, the cap-and-trade portion doesnt affect electricity bills very much for a customer in Ocean Sprays rate class.For the average customer in that rate class, the cap-and-trade portion -- meaning the cost of purchasing allowances -- accounts for 0.4 percent of the annual bill, Johnson said.Judi Greenwald, vice president of Innovative Solutions at the Virginia-based Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the effects of RGGI on utility costs have been mostly undetectable.The rate impacts have been miniscule and probably not even perceptible, Greenwald told us.Across the 10-state region within the RGGI, the emissions cap accounted for between 0.24 and 0.61 percent of average residential electricity bills in 2010, according to a fact sheet prepared by RGGI.", "That impact represents 46 extra cents per month for a typical households electricity usage, according to the RGGI.In many cases, electricity prices in New Jersey are based on bids submitted by suppliers in non-RGGI states, according to Peter Shattuck, a carbon markets policy analyst for Environment Northeast.", "For instance, if a supplier in Pennsylvania, which is not part of RGGI, sets the price, New Jersey utilities are not facing RGGI-related charges, he said.So lets review:Allen claimed that Ocean Spray was leaving Bordentown in large measure due to the costs associated with RGGI.", "Yet Ocean Spray said it did not consider RGGI and its impacts on the energy rate.On top of that, a PSE&G spokeswoman and energy experts said RGGI has had a minimal impact on utility costs.We rate Allens statement False.", "To comment on this ruling,join the conversation at NJ.com."], "issues": ["New Jersey", "Cap and Trade", "Climate Change", "Economy"], "image_data": [], "data": [{"sentence": "Editor's Note: This Truth-O-Meter ruling is the subject of a story foundhere.", "hrefs": "https://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/article/2011/jun/29/truth-o-meter-ruling-stands-despite-juicy-protest-/"}, {"sentence": "To comment on this ruling,join the conversation at NJ.com.", "hrefs": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/politifact_new_jersey_environm.html"}], "label": "false"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/jun/09/gop-critics/anonymous-gop-officials-claim-commerce-nominee-joh/", "title": "Commerce Secretary nominee John Bryson appears to endorse world government.", "author": "Robert Farley", "posted": "06/09/2011", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["Supporting climate change policy is one thing, but is Barack Obamas nominee for commerce secretary, John Bryson, an advocate for world government?That's the speculation raised by anonymous GOP sources on Capitol Hill, according to the conservative website theDaily Caller.Bryson, former chief executive officer and chairman of Southern California energy conglomerate Edison International and co-founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, has been under fire due to his support for clean-energy legislation.", "Sen.

The original simplicity was lost, replaced by a bazaar in which those with the most muscle got the best deals.McCains staff did not respond to our request to discuss his stance on the House cap-and-trade bill that Boccieri supported. Until late August, McCain faced a tough primary battle against former GOP congressman J. D. Hayworth, who had criticized McCains support for cap-and-trade. Energy expertFrank Maisanosaid McCain has been silent on the issue recently, because of political pressures he was getting from the right during that campaign.We find Boccieris statement that John

"So bear with us as we try to explain how they work and investigate whether the ad portrays them fairly.", "Our aim is to gauge whether the ad is accurate when it says that making these changes would amount to a handout to companies like BP.", "Let's start with the dual capacity rule.", "This rule stems from a tax code provision that lets U.S. taxpayers receive credit for taxes paid on income derived overseas, so income is not taxed twice.", "Say you're a U.S. oil company.", "You go to a foreign country to extract oil.", "You pay a 20 percent tax to that country on what you extract.", "When your U.S. taxes are calculated, you'll get a dollar-for-dollar credit for the taxes paid overseas.", "Where it starts getting complicated is that some foreign countries charge oil extractors a single payment that includes both the tax and a payment for the right to drill in the first place.", "So, rather than paying 20 percent tax on what's extracted, the company will have to pay more, because the rights to drill are included in the same levy.", "(The dual nature of these payments is the origin of the term dual capacity.)", "Whether the company considers this a tax or a royalty payment matters quite a bit for the U.S. company's tax bill because amounts considered to be foreign taxes provide dollar-for-dollar reductions in tax liability, whereas a royalty only permits a deduction, which is a significantly smaller tax benefit than dollar-for-dollar.", "So, the greater the amount that's considered a foreign tax, the larger the sum that can be deducted from U.S. taxes.", "Current U.S. tax law deals with this by trying to determine what part is the true tax (and thus eligible for a dollar-for-dollar tax credit) and what is being paid by the company for a specific economic benefit, such as the right to drill (which is only deductible as a business expense).", "This is a fairly easy process if the foreign country has a straightforward corporate tax structure.", "But it gets complicated if the country either taxes dual capacity taxpayers at a different rate than other corporate taxpayers or if it has no basic corporate tax rate at all.", "In such cases, U.S. companies have more flexibility to call the payments they've made taxes -- too much flexibility for some critics, who argue that it's an unnecessary loophole that drains the U.S. Treasury

claim that these proposals could result in the elimination of 600,000 jobs, higher gasoline prices or greater dependence on foreign oil, since such estimates are speculative and ultimately not provable.", "Instead, we'll focus on whether the ad is justified in calling such changes a handout to BP or other foreign companies.In the ad's defense, the changes would only affect U.S.-based companies, and by taking away a benefit from a U.S. firm, the government could, in a sense, be advantaging foreign-based firms.Pete Sepp, NTU's executive vice president, said that the two tax provisions were created to take the sting off the U.S. corporate tax code.", "Because many of the United States' competitors do not tax the foreign earnings of domestic firms -- but we do -- deductions and exemptions like the two in question here help U.S. competitiveness.", "Taking away one or both these provisions for oil companies -- provisions that exist for a wide variety of firms -- will, in our opinion, necessarily increase the overhead of oil and gas firms (based) here.", "That means higher costs for those firms -- costs which foreign-based competitors like BP don't have to shoulder.Still, handout is a pretty strong word to describe what's being proposed.", "In Webster's New World Dictionary, the relevant definition of handout is a gift of food, clothing, etc., as to a beggar.", "Allowing for some artistic license to exchange BP for beggar, we think the accuracy of handout depends on whether the government is affirmatively providing a direct benefit to BP.", "And it's not clear that the government would be doing this if it made these changes.If the government were to pass these two policy proposals, it would certainly be taking away a benefit granted to U.S.-based oil and gas companies.", "But would taking away the two benefits from U.S. companies be equivalent to giving a handout to BP?", "We're not so sure.Mitchell Kane, a professor at New York University Law School who specializes in international corporate taxation, said the use of the term handout in this context is highly misleading, noting that there would be no change at all to BP's tax liability.", "There could be competitive effects, but this is a highly speculative claim, and in any event is not what most people think of as a handout, Kane said.", "If your co-worker loses her job, and there is therefore less competition in the company for promotions and future raises, does this mean you have received a 'handout?", "'There's another reason to question whether BP's British owners are the only ones who would benefit if these provisions were to pass.", "In a globalized economy, some Americans would actually benefit, since foreign companies employ, do business with and pay quarterly dividends to lots of U.S. taxpayers.", "According to BP's website, it is the largest oil and gas producer and one of the largest gasoline retailers in the United States, as well as the largest non-U.S. company traded on the New York Stock Exchange.", "And U.S.-based subsidiaries of foreign companies, including BP's U.S. subsidiaries, qualify for Section 199 credits, which weakens the argument that BP would be a clear winner if these changes were made.It's certainly understandable that U.S. oil companies doing business overseas would be opposed to these proposals -- and perhaps feel picked on, since both changes specifically target their industry.", "Still, we think the term handout in this context is questionable -- even hypocritical, since the tax policy the oil companies want to keep in place could easily be described as involving longstanding handouts for them.", "On balance, we rate the statement Half True."], "issues": ["Environment", "National", "Cap and Trade",

The reports cited by CBO are full employment models designed to assess the long-term impact (30 to 50 years), Houser said.Whitney Smith, press secretary for Kerry, also stressed that the three studies cited in the CBO report were not about Kerry's American Power Act specifically. And Smith cited a Peterson Institute response to the CBO study, which argues that the methodological approach of the studies included in the CBO report arguably overstates potential job losses.So what other reports was Kerry referring to when he said every major study that has been done by a legitimate group, most recently the Peterson Institute of Economics...?According to Smith, Kerry was also referencing a report from Third Way, which describes itself as a moderate think-tank of the progressive movement. The report concluded that job losses in old industries will be more than offset by an increase in clean energy jobs so that that carbon pricing will result in net job growth of somewhere between 118,000 to 1.1 million jobs.But theThird Way reportisn't a study of the American Power Act either. It's a review of two dozen studies over the last three years of various plans to put a price on carbon. Third Way rejected reports from the ideological left and right and considered just those in the middle.While the Third Way review did not specifically address the American Power Act, there is nothing in this latest cap-and-trade bill that would make it differ much with regard to the projections about the broad impact on the economy and the number of jobs gained, said Josh Freed, director of the Third Way Clean Energy Program.If Kerry is going to hang his hat on the fact that none of the other studies (such as those cited in the CBO report) looked at the American Power Act specifically, then we are really only talking about one study, the Peterson Institute study. We aren't aware of any others. Neither are the folks at the Peterson Institute. And the Third Way study cited by the Kerry spokesman isn't an analysis of the American Power Act either.So the question then is whether the American Power Act is so different from past versions of the cap-and-trade bill, or the generic versions modeled by various economists, that it would render their conclusions irrelevant in analyzing the American Power Act. And many economists we spoke to said that's not the case, that the earlier versions are substantially similar to Kerry's, especially for the purpose of analyzing the bills' jobs impact. And the fact that Kerry's spokesman included the Third Way study suggests they think it's fair game to consider older versions of cap-and-trade legislation for comparative purposes as well.Economists at the Peterson Institute, the Brookings Institution -- or for that matter at, say, the conservative Heritage Foundation, which projected a cap-and-trade bill could cost millions of jobs -- certainly disagree about each others' methodology. Various economic models employ different assumptions about everything from the viability of doubling the number of nuclear power plants to the prospects for the economy. They all look at different timelines. You may agree or disagree with the findings and methodology of the Peterson Institute study, but the fact is that other legitimate groups have performed studies and reached different conclusions.Kerry's statement suggests there is some unanimity of opinion among legitimate organizations about cap-and-trade's effect on jobs. And that's just not so. There is quite a bit of disagreement. So we rate Kerry's claim False.", "hrefs": "http://content.thirdway.org/publications/291/Third_Way_Report_-_Putting_a_Price_on_Success-The_Case_for_Pricing_Carbon.pdf"}], "label": "false"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2010/jun/08/rick-perry/gov-perry-says-democrat-bill-white-sent-president-/", "title": "My opponent in November of 2008 sent a missive to the White House, to President Obama-elect, and said, 'Here's how you need to sell cap-and-trade to the American people.'

with nasty images from the oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico.Then we are introduced to Evan Wolf, a Louisiana National Guardsman who was assigned to Gulf Coast clean up.When I signed on to the National Guard, I did it to help protect Americans from our enemies, like in the Persian Gulf, not to clean up an oil company's mess here in the Gulf of Mexico, Wolf says.He holds up a freezer bag filled with a murky goop.We'll do whatever mission we're given and do it well, Wolf says.", "But America needs a new mission.", "Because whether it's deep drilling oil out here, or spending a billion dollars a day on oil from our enemies overseas, our dependence on oil is threatening our national security.Thing is, a clean American energy plan would cut our dependence on oil in half.", "It's more power for America, made here in America.", "Putting our people to work using all the resources we have.We then get images of solar and wind farms.Some folks in Washington say now is not the time to clean American power, Wolf says, and then dabs at oil staining a Louisiana beach.", "I've gotta ask -- if not now  when?", "By way of background, Wolf was a Democratic candidate for the Louisiana House in 2007.", "He lost, but a Democratic National Committee web page suggests he's at least mulling another run.VoteVets explained that the ad is advocating for the American Power Act, and that it is that bill that would cut our dependence on oil in half.", "That's the claim we are checking here.The American Power Act is the latest version of the cap and trade bill that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "Obama put in a plug for the bill in a speech on June 2, 2010, in Pittsburgh.", "The time has come, once and for all, for this nation to fully embrace a clean energy future, Obama said, and vowed it would become an administration priority.", "The votes may not be there right now, but I intend to find them in the coming months, Obama said.VoteVets backs up the ad's claim that the American Power Act would cut our dependence on oil in half by citing a 2009 analysis from the National Resources Defense Council of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, which was passed by the House on June 26, 2009.", "The bill sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a variety of market-based (cap-and-trade) mechanisms, incentives for energy efficiency and the development of clean energy.The Council's report on the House bill last year concluded that if the bill passed, America's dependence on foreign oil would be cut in half by 2050.", "But the same report projected that while oil imports would be halved, overall oil consumption would drop by about 12 percent between 2010 and 2050 (from 17.1 million barrels per day to 15 million barrels per day in 2050).We note that in the ad, Wolf doesn't say the bill would cut consumption of foreign oil in half, it says the bill would cut our dependence on oil in half.", "There's a difference.", "VoteVets, which is backing the video with a $1.5 million ad buy, contends the context of the ad makes clear that they are talking about oil imports, but we don't agree.", "The ad is set against the backdrop of an oil drilling catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico.", "In his setup, Wolf frames the discussion as whether it's deep drilling oil out here, or spending a billion dollars a day on oil from our enemies overseas.", "That seems to us like he's talking about oil consumption in general and the need for the United States to ween off it.", "Reducing dependence on foreign oil would not reduce drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.It's also worth noting that the government did an analysis of the 2009 House version of the bill and didn't paint quite as rosy a picture as the Council.", "The U.S. Energy Information Administration would only project to 2030 (not 2050).", "But the EIA's report projected relatively little change in overall liquid fuel consumption.", "The report did forecast that U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports would decline, from 8.26 million barrels per day in 2010 to 6.3 million barrels per day in 2030.", "That's a roughly 24 percent decrease.But the report also projected a decline in foreign oil imports even without the bill.", "There are a numbers of reasons for that, said Jonathan Cogan, spokesman for U.S. Energy Information Administration: a slight increase in domestic oil production; increased use of bio-fuels; tighter fuel efficiency standards; and an expected rise in oil prices.The EIA has not yet finished its analysis of the American Power Act, Cogan noted, though it should be completed in mid to late June.", "The goals of the Senate bill and last year's House bill may be the same, but the mechanisms are a little different, so using the EIA report on the 2009 House bill to judge the 2010 Senate bill is an imperfect comparison, Cogan said.However, Daniel Lashof, director of the Council's Climate Center, said the basic provisions are similar enough that the 2009 analyses are legitimate.", "Therefore, he said, the Council is comfortable with the projection that the American Power Act has the potential to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil by 50 percent by 2050.Lashof said part of the reason the Council's projections differed from the EIA's is that EIA did not account for the potential boost to domestic oil production by capturing carbon dioxide from power plants.", "Recovered carbon dioxide -- encouraged by the bill -- can be injected into depleted oil fields to enhance oil production, Lashof said.", "As a result, he said, the NRDC projects a slight increase in domestic oil production between now and 2050 under the bill, but in a safer way not subject to the kinds of risks of going into deeper and deeper water offshore.In summary, the ad claims that if the American Power Act is passed, it would cut our dependence on oil in half.", "VoteVets says they were talking about cutting dependence on foreign oil in half.", "And they point to a credible report from the Council that projects a similar bill would cut foreign oil imports in half by 2050.", "A spokesman for the EIA says basing a projection of the effect of the 2010 Senate bill on an analysis of a similar, but different, 2010 Senate bill is an imperfect comparison.We also note that the EIA's analysis of the 2009 House version of the bill is less optimistic than the NRDC.", "But most significantly, we think the context of the ad suggests Wolf is talking about cutting overall oil consumption -- not just foreign oil imports -- in half.", "If they were only talking about oil imports, why would Wolf be standing on an oil-stained beach in Louisiana?", "Perhaps newer reports will ultimately back up the VoteVets claim, but they based their claim on a 2009

Agriculture and rural America will see a boom in investments in biofuels and alternative energy sources.Both bills include funding for worker training and expanded unemployment benefits; for example, the House bill would provide 156 weeks of benefits, helping to pay for health insurance, job training and employment search assistanceto those who lose their jobsas the result of cap-and-trade.But neither House nor Senate lawmakers working on the legislation have pinned down exactly how many jobs their bills would eliminate and create, so we decided to look at other estimates.The Center for American Progress, another liberal group, says the bill could create a net increase of about 1.7 million jobs so long as $150 billion is dedicated to the clean-energy industry every year.These job gains would be enough  on their own  to reduce the unemployment rate in todays economy by about one full percentage point, to 8.4 percent from current 9.4 percent levels  even after taking into full account the inevitable job losses in conventional fossil fuel sectors of the U.S. economy as they contract, according to the June 2009 report.And a second analysis done by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a group that is supporting the bill, estimates that the cap-and-trade bill could create anywhere between 600,000 and 1 million new jobs by 2030.Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report in September 2009 that the cap-and-trade plan would have a minor effect on employment in the long-run.The small effect on overall employment would mask a significant shift in the composition of employment over time, according to the report. A cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions would reduce the number of jobs in industries that produce carbon-based energy, use energy intensively in their production processes, or produce products whose use involves energy consumption, because those industries would experience the greatest increases in costs and declines in sales. But the shifts in demand caused by the policy would also create new employment opportunities in some industries.Stephen Seidel, vice president for policy analysis and general counsel at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said, Estimating jobs is a very difficult task for the limited modeling tools that we have. Jobs will almost certainly be lost and created under a cap-and-trade program, it's just a matter to what degree, he said. The CRA International report used in the EnergyCitizens.org ad falls on the high end.So, back to EnergyCitizens.org's claim that 2 million jobs will be lost under cap-and-trade. As we've shown, the job predictions are all over the map. Supporters of cap-and-trade predict an increase. CRA, which was hired by an opponent of the proposal, says jobs will be lost. The independent CBO characterizes it as a wash.Of all these groups, we're inclined to believe the CBO, since it is independent. But we can't rule out the possibility that there could be gains or losses on either end, as the predictions aligned with supporters and opponents suggest. So we find the ad's claim to be Barely True.", "hrefs": "https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/16/sarah-palin/palin-claims-cap-and-trade-bill-includes-42-billio/"}], "label":

would translate to lower costs to consumers.", "Heritage takes an austere approach, assuming that traditional energy sources would be scaled back to meet new emissions standards, but would not be

No matter how many suave European continentals you send here, it won't change voters' minds.To support their claim, the board included a June 28-29 Rasmussen poll that shows that 56 percent of Americans said they wouldn't pay more taxes to cut greenhouse gases. The question  and the op-ed  leave out the important fact that the bill doesn't impose new taxes (though it's likely people would see higher utility bills as the result of cap-and-trade, which would raise the cost of energy at least slightly).But the claim piqued our interest nevertheless, so we decided to check other polls to see how the plan is playing among voters.The background: Cap-and-trade is a way to slow climate change by reducing carbon emissions. The idea is to cap emissions and require firms to either buy polluting permits or upgrade to cleaner technologies. House lawmakers included such a plan in a bill passed on June 26 that will lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050.So let's look at how much support it has. AWashington Post/ABC News survey published on June 25, a day before the bill was passed, showed that 75 percent of Americans think the government should regulate greenhouse gas emissions to reduce global warming. About 52 percent support a cap-and-trade program to accomplish that. Opposition has grown to 42 percent, up from 34 percent in the summer of 2008.The same pollsters did a follow-up survey Aug. 13-17 and found that support for cap-and-trade was unchanged. This time, however, the poll provided more detail. About 58 percent said they would support the idea if it raised monthly electric bills by 10 dollars. But when that cost went up to 25 dollars, support dropped to 39 percent.(We've already explored different opinions on how much the legislation might cost, and you can read about themhere.)Meanwhile, a Zogby poll published on Aug. 11 found that 71 percent of Americans support the legislation that was passed in the House.It's worth noting that all those numbers are up from polls that were taken earlier in the year, before the bill was debated and passed in the House. For example, in April, a Zogby poll found that 30 percent of respondents supported cap-and-trade. And a CNN poll done one month later found that 44 percent favor a cap-and-trade plan.So, given the most recent polling, it would be fair to say that a slight majority of Americans support cap-and-trade but that those numbers may decrease depending on how much it would cost in higher utility bills. Even so, at its lowest, nearly 40 percent of Americans would still support cap-and-trade even if it meant heftier energy bills. In no case do polling numbers show that cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular, as the editors ofIBDclaim, so we give this one a False.", "hrefs": "https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2009/jun/25/your-guide-cap-and-trade/"}], "label": "false"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2009/jul/22/house-republicans/house-republicans-say-government-will-take-old-woo/", "title": "The government is going to tell Americans they need to replace functioning stoves in their homes with 'government-certified' stoves and use taxpayer dollars to do so.", "author": "Catharine Richert", "posted": "07/22/2009", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["House Republicans are playing truth-squad with the cap-and-trade bill.Every day they post one claim about the bill on theirWeb sitein an effort to demonstrate why cap-and-trade, which is intended to slow climate change by limiting carbon dioxide emissions, is bad for consumers.", "Most Republicans oppose the bill.Daily Truth No.", "14, which deals with a government program on wood stoves, caught our eye: The government is going to tell Americans they need to replace functioning stoves in their homes with 'government-certified' stoves and use taxpayer dollars to do so.", "The Democrats national energy tax is just more government intrusion and more taxpayer dollars used for government-imposed mandates.From the sound of this claim, it seems like the government would demand all wood stoves be replaced (we imagine packs of bureaucrats knocking down doors and tearing wood stoves out of walls).", "We wondered whether the cap-and-trade bill really contains such a requirement.Indeed, the bill does set aside about $20 million to replace old wood or pellet stoves  specifically, stoves manufactured before July 1, 1990  with newer, more efficient models.", "The money would help consumers pay for the upgrade.", "They would receive a 30 percent tax credit for costs incurred, up to $1,500.As it does with most appliances, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets efficiency standards for wood stoves, and to get the tax credit, consumers would have to buy one that bears the EPA certified label.", "Supporters of the stove swap initiative say it could help reduce air pollution.", "According to the EPA, certified stoves emit about three-fourths less pollution than do older models.", "In some parts of the United States, consumers have already taken advantage of a pilot program encouraging people to buy new stoves, and the bill simply expands that to stove owners throughout the country.Republicans have it partly right about how the program would work.", "It would use taxpayer money to help consumers upgrade their older, dirtier stoves.", "And to get the rebate, consumers would have to buy an EPA-approved stove.", "However, the government is not forcing them to replace the stoves.This is not a mandatory program, said Paul Heintz, communications director for Rep.
