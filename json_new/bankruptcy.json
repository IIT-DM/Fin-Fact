U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse is being accused ina recent television commercialof using insider information to avoid financial losses.In the ad, Whitehouse pops up three times to utter the phrase fighting for the people as a female narrator says: September 08. An economic storm brews. Within months, millions of Americans will lose jobs, homes and life savings.In Washington, the commercial continues, Sheldon Whitehouse gets a secret closed-door briefing warning of the crash. After that secret briefing, certain stocks he owned got sold just in time. Some people go to prison for that. That's not fighting for us.To emphasize the insider trading allegation, the ad shows an image of Martha Stewart, who servedtime in prisonforobstructing justice and lying to the governmentin an insider trading case. The YouTube version of the ad, posted Oct. 25, 2012, is titled Insider Trading.Did Whitehouse really get a secret briefing warning of the crash?First, some background.Questions about insider trading by Whitehouse and other members of Congress surfaced in November 2011 in Throw Them All Out, a book whose author, Peter Schweizer, was featured on the CBS news program 60 Minutes on Nov. 13, 2011.On Sept. 16, 2008,Schweizer reported, top congressional leaders were briefed by top Bush administration officials -- then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke -- about the unfolding financial crisis.In his book, Schweizer says Whitehouse was one of many members of Congress who sold holdings after the briefing.Over the next week, Whitehousesold stockin eight companies involving a dozen trades valued between $425,000 and $950,000 (the total is uncertain because his disclosure form only gives price ranges), according to his disclosure form.The timing of the trades raised questions of insider trading. Under the law in effect at the time, members of Congress couldn't be prosecuted for engaging in such activity, which is illegal for the general public. (The insider trading law has since been amended, with Whitehouse's support, to include members of Congress.)But theres a key problem with the ads central allegation that Whitehouse benefited from information he received at the briefing.Whitehouse says he wasn't at the meeting, which was only for top Congressional leaders, and he was not in the leadership in 2008. The Schweizer book offers no evidence that he was there.The ad comes fromPeople's Majority, a super PAC whose address is a post office box in Alexandria, Va. Filings with the Federal Election Commission say it was formed to oppose Whitehouse.Its websitedoesn't give a location or a phone number, but it does say it was formed with the hope of restoring a Republican majority in the United States Congress.Whitehouse is the only candidate mentioned.Federal documents have listed the treasurer as Ken McKay, a former GOP chairman in Rhode Island, chief of staff for former Gov. Donald L. Carcieri and later the chief of staff for former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael S. Steele. Newer documents identify the current treasurer as Cabell Hobbs.We sent an e-mail to the only recent address we could find on the FEC documents and asked for backup. We then got a call from Dave Owen, of Owen Communications, in Salt Lake City, a consultant acting as a spokesman for People's Majority.So what evidence did People's Majority have that Whitehouse attended a secret closed-door briefing?We don't say he attended the briefing, said Owen. We say he gets a briefing, he gets the information from the briefing.We were unclear on whether he denied being in the briefing, Owen said. Frankly, if you're going to do one of these things you push the envelope and walk a line.For the record, the Sept. 16 briefing came at a time when President George W. Bush had already signed the government rescue of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Fannie and Freddie had been placed under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, their CEOs and board of directors had been dismissed, Lehman Brothers had declared bankruptcy and the Dow Jones Industrial average had lost more than 12 percent of its value since May.On the day of the briefing, the government moved to bail out the insurance giant AIG. That week wasthe biggest trading weekin the history of the New York Stock Exchange.In short, the financial meltdown was already underway. The ripple effects were just beginning to unfold.Whitehouse has said that the trades done from Sept. 16-22 were executed by a financial adviser who had the power to buy and sell stock without consulting him.I virtually never have a conversation with the adviser, he told The Providence Journal in November 2011. With all the turmoil on Wall Street at the time, It's presumably pretty obvious that they were trying to be defensive with my account, but I can't go back and read their minds, he said.Our rulingThe super PAC People's Majority said Sheldon Whitehouse got a secret closed-door briefing warning of the crash and used the information to sell stocks before the crash.But the organization couldn't provide evidence that Whitehouse was atanybriefing where he got inside information warning that the financial meltdown, already underway, was going to get worse.A People's Majority spokesman told us, We don't say [Whitehouse] attended the briefing and the ad was an attempt to push the envelope.In fact, the addoessay Whitehouse attended the briefing, not only pushing the envelope but shredding it.With no evidence to back up its inflammatory claim, the People's Majority ad is worthy of a little inflammation of its own.

For example, Atlantic City has lost business to newer casinos in Pennsylvania, whose residents can now gamble closer to home instead of making the trip to New Jersey.Its in that sort of competitive market when management can be particularly important. Rose referred to Colorados experience in the early 1990s when 68 casinos opened in two or three years. A third of them eventually went bankrupt, and, said Rose, it turned out that the operators of those failed casinos had no previous experience in the industry.Our rulingGambling is a boom or bust industry. Even when times are good, casinos fail. And when times are bad, even more fail.As Schwartz told us, casinos definitely are not a sure thing. Good management matters  -- a point Jacquard made as well.We rate Jacquards statement True.(Get updates fromPolitiFactRI on Twitter.

inauguration, though today's level is still lower than it was in 2007.The stock market.", "The stock market is one step removed from basic economic indicators, but it does show what investors think about the prospects for the broader economy.", "And since Obama was inaugurated, it's been going like gangbusters.", "The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by a whopping 44 percent between Jan.

And if it doesn't, taxpayers could be on the hook for higher costs.In fact, if Obama had made the comparison much earlier in the crisis, the federal government would have been on the hook for a potentially enormous bill, said Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a law professor at George Washington University who specializes in business and finance. It is fortunate that the ultimate bill will probably turn out to be much lower than the worst-case-scenario. By the same token, he said, troubles in the housing market could increase the cost of recovery efforts within another year or two. In my opinion, it is far too early to conclude that we have successfully contained and resolved the financial crisis.So where does this leave us? Obama has repeated a defensible estimate of the cost of the two financial crises. But there are lots of other estimates that would be equally if not more valid, and those wouldn't be as favorable to the White House's case. The figures Obama cited don't include many of the ancillary (and often intangible) costs of the recovery, and there's no way of knowing for sure that current cost estimates won't go up in future years.

This became a special focus of attention after Republican pollster Frank Luntz advised opponents of regulation that the single best way to kill any legislation is to link it to the Big Bank Bailout.In an April 19, 2010, floor speech, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said that the bill will end taxpayer bailouts. That came a few days after Reid's Republican counterpart, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at an April 14 press conference, In fact, if you look at it carefully, it will lead to endless taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street banks. McConnell added that the bill actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks and that it sets up in perpetuity the potential for additional taxpayer bailouts of large institutions.In a separate item, weruled McConnell's statement False. Here, we'll tackle Reid's claim.First, some background on the financial regulations now under consideration in the Senate, with the caveat that the bill is something of a moving target. There are separate House and Senate versions, and once a unified version becomes law, there may be specific regulatory aspects delegated to federal agencies.That said, the Senate bill would grant the government additional authority to regulate over-the-counter derivatives and hedge funds. It would establish a new consumer protection agency within the Federal Reserve to regulate financial products, and it would create a process for federal authorities to dissolve financial institutions that are teetering on collapse.On this last point, the bill would set up a panel of three bankruptcy judges to convene and agree within 24 hours whether a large financial company is insolvent. If a systematically significant firm is teetering on collapse, the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve would have to agree to liquidate the firm, using a special fund created with payments from the largest financial firms. The FDIC shall impose assessments on a graduated basis, with financial companies having greater assets being assessed at a higher rate, according to the legislation.We should clarify that there will be no change for small, mid-sized and even fairly large banks; when they're in trouble, there's already a well-established mechanism, under FDIC authority, that is not considered a bailout.Instead, the bailouts at issue are those for the small number of very large, highly interconnected institutions -- those sometimes called too big to fail because their collapse would severely impact the rest of the economy.The legislative language is very specific about the money being used to dissolve -- meaning completely shut down -- failing firms. Here's what Sec. 206 of the bill says:In taking action under this title, the (FDIC) shall determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company; ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Fund are fully paid; ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions in section 210; ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the FDIC is appointed receiver); and not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary.There is some speculation that the industry-financed fund, envisioned to be $50 billion, could be dropped from the bill, since it wasn't in the White House's original proposal. But the provision was still in the bill when Reid spoke, so we'll factor it into our analysis.A big challenge in analyzing Reid's statement, or any like it, is figuring out what exactly the word bailout means.It is almost impossible to pin politicians down on this one because 'bailout' has no clear meaning, said Douglas Elliott, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a public policy think tank.
