financial reports that Block cited as his source for firefighting costs in other places and Block appeared to be in the ballpark.", "But Block did not provide the same type of source material that he gave for the 10 communities outside of Rhode Island to back up his claim about the costs of firefighting in Rhode Island.", "Watchdog RIs report posted on its website has no appendix or footnotes.",

amounts in other areas that Watchdog RI selected for comparison.", "Before you put too much stock in these comparisons, consider this: Block says he suspected the Rhode Island numbers did not  include pension costs, which are a major line item.", "Therefore, we removed pension costs for the five Rhode Island cities we looked at.", "But for the comparison communities, we discovered that spending that he cited for Orange County and Miami did include pension costs; $12.6 million in Orange County and $23.7 million in Miami, but the Los Angeles number did not.", "Its a muddle.", "Put simply, were

The Marlins pays the city about $10 per parking space.If all this werent complicated enough, in 2011, theMiami Heraldreported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission -- which was already reviewing the city of Miamis finances -- had launched a separate probe of the stadium deal, to see if the city misled investors about the parking complex bonds.Experts say that Loria is omitting some key pointsWe interviewed a few stadium financing experts who said that while Loria was correct that hotel bed taxes paid for a huge chunk of the cost, his claim obscured the fact that it was still public money, and it could have been spent on other projects to benefit local taxpayers.Simply put, Miami is going to get bed tax revenue regardless of whether Marlins park was built. So the implication that the citys budget wasnt affected by their decision to allocate their limited tax revenue to stadium construction is disingenuous, said Chris Lafakis, Moodys senior economist who analyzes Florida, in an email to PolitiFact.We also interviewed Adie Tomer and Siddharth Kulkarni, researchers for the Brookings Institutions Metropolitan Policy Program. They havearguedthat the stadium will cost the county $2 billion over 40 years, when all the interest on the borrowing is included.Focusing on tourist taxes obscures the real essence of debate, which is what can Miami do with this revenue? Tomer said. $2 billion is an enormous long-term cost. Those revenues are lost now.Roger Noll, a Stanford economics professor, said that higher taxes on tourists take away money they would have spent in local businesses. Politically, taxing tourist-related activities (hotels, rental cars) is attractive, because some voters do not understand that a targeted tax hurts the business that is being taxed as well as its customers, he said.Jonah Keri, a baseball writer for ESPNsGrantland, said Lorias letter is right on one point: The county should get some of the blame on the stadium deal.Loria is saying the real idiots here are the government who didnt protect you from me, Keri said. Thats true. The thing about Loria is, I dont think he is that much worse than any other owner. It really is the case that local officials are the ones who bungled this. Any capitalist is going to do this.In an interview with PolitiFact, Marlins president David Samson defended Lorias claim, noting that bed taxes cant fund general government functions.It cant go to police officers, firefighters, nurses, doctors, ambulance drivers. ... It cannot be used to build park shelters for the homeless, as an example.Our rulingIn response to renewed criticism about the 2009 Marlins stadium financing deal, Loria said The majority of public funding came from hotel taxes, the burden of which is incurred by tourists who are visiting our city, NOT the resident taxpayers.Loria is borrowing from politicians playbooks here: He cherry-picked a fact that puts the situation in the best light while omitting a thorough explanation. On the surface, he is correct: Much of the public funding for the stadium came from hotel bed taxes largely (though not entirely) paid for by tourists.But these are still tax revenues that belong to the taxpayer, and if it didnt go to the Marlins, it would have gone to some other public purpose to benefit those taxpayers. He also ignores that the county will be paying off that debt for decades. His implication that locals can shrug their shoulders at that public cost, and dismiss it as coming from the wallets of out of town tourists, is disingenuous.We rate this claim Half True.", "hrefs": "http://www.miamidade.gov/internalservices/library/managers_memo.pdf"}], "label": "half-true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/jan/31/david-clarke-jr/calling-citizens-get-gun-training-milwaukee-county/", "title": "I had to lay off 48 people last year, which has exacerbated the lack of law enforcement officers in the county that respond quickly to crime calls.", "author": "Tom Kertscher", "posted": "01/31/2013", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["When Milwaukee County SheriffDavid A.

And I think thats a small price to pay for enhanced public safety.With property tax bills landing in mailboxes, time for a refresher course on how this all works.County Board fiscal and budget analyst Steve Cady said the claim was based on City of Milwaukee property revaluations, which were set in spring 2012. These are done annually to keep up with changes in the housing market.The average Milwaukee house had an assessed value of about $106,000. The tax rate set in the county budget is about $5.25 per $1,000 of assessed value. Thats up 54 cents. (On the tax bill, the county tax rate is lumped together with the rate to support the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission, but that groups portion of the bill is tiny.)How much you owe is determined by the value of your house.In the 2012 reassessment, the average home in the city fell from $122,793 to $106,000. That means even though the tax rate went up, the bill for the county share of taxes went  down on that home by about $19.So in dollars and cents terms, Dimitrijevic is correct.But theres a lot more to the story.Across the country the value of residential property got hammered in the real estate bust, and Milwaukee was no exception. Between the beginning of 2008 and 2012, total assessed residential property value in Milwaukee fell by about 30 percent, said assessment commissioner Mary Reavey. Of course, it depends on your neighborhood and condition of your home -- some losses could be much higher (or lower) than others.Most people dont cheer when their major asset goes down in value, noted Paula Hogan, a certified financial planner who operates her own firm in Glendale.But, in effect, that is what Dimitrijevic is suggesting Milwaukee property owners do.What about the reverse? Should homeowners want their house values and tax bill to increase?Not necessarily, said Michael Arnow, a certified financial planner with Menomonee Falls-based Sattell, Johnson, Appel Financial Advisory LLC.A higher assessment is a double-edged sword, he said. If your tax bill goes up, you pay more taxes. Who wants to pay more taxes? If the value of your home goes up and you are a retiree on a fixed income you can be priced out of your neighborhood.In the case of this years bills, property owners may be paying somewhat less in taxes but the long-term loss is more serious, experts said.For that average City of Milwaukee homeowner, the total tax bill for all taxing units this year would be $3,175, down about $107 from a year ago.

Government", "Education", "Taxes"], "image_data": [], "data": [{"sentence": "As the brouhaha over schools continues in the states largest county, funding issues have stayed secondary to the crucial legal questions involving whether Memphis can successfully force real countywide schools consolidation with its suburban Shelby County neighbors.But Martavius Jones, the former Memphis City Schools board president who helped lead the surrender of the systems charter last year, gave a preview of funding rhetoric likely to grow louder as the July 1, 2013, deadline for completing merger grows near. Given that more than 16 percent of thestates education moneygoes to schools in Memphis and Shelby County, how the issue plays out could have a ripple effect on systems across the state.A private financial planner and executive committee member of the countys schools merger Transition Planning Commission (TPC), Jones appeared on a Fox 13 News morning show to discuss the legal fight between the city and suburbs.After giving his view that the suburbs were following an unconstitutional path toward splitting the county into essentially seven school districts, Jones said the planning commissions had created a blueprint for a world class unified school district. However, he added, the funding issue is quite an obstacle.From a standpoint of the county government, Jones said, neither school system has received an increase in funding over the past six years.Jones backed up his assertion in an email to us: By the time the districts are merged in 2013, it would have been six years since there was an increase in funding from the county.In terms of their overall budgets, we knew thatMCS, still in existence for one final school year, and the for now still suburban-onlyShelby County Schoolshad seen slight increases in overall expenditures.In Tennessee, although a large chunk of the most counties operating budgets goes toward school operations, the majority of funding for schools comes from the state. So its possible that school budgets grew even while local contributions remained flat. And a look atbudgets for the countyconfirms that, every year since the 2008 fiscal year, the county has allocated the same number of property-tax dollars to the countys schools -- $361,288,000.That big number has been apportioned to the countys two school districts (MCS and SCS) according to enrollment, or what is known as Average Daily Attendance, with the current split about 68 percent for the city and 32 percent for the suburbs. Enrollment numbers fluctuate somewhat each year, so that a marginal fraction of funds seesaw back and forth between MCS and SCS.Mike Ritz, budget chairman for the county commission and its chairman beginning next month, has some real quarrels with how Jones and other school officials frame the funding argument, but he says: Hes absolutely right -- since I was elected weve stopped paying extra money.What irks Ritz is what he calls complaining by schools officials that the county is not providing more money, because he believes it distracts from the fact that MCS and SCS have seen big increases in money from the state. Some recent changes in the states funding formula have increased state funding for larger school districts like those in Shelby, Davidson, Hamilton and Knox County.Quite frankly, theyve had a humongous increase in funds available, Ritz said. Thats why I keep telling the commissioners that we dont need to worry about (increasing funding) when the state continues to do it for them.Well leave that statement aside for a potential future PolitiFact, although public-school advocates have a ready rejoinder. They point out that even while the county has stopped increasing school funding, revenues for county government have been steadily increased. Property tax revenue in 2008 was $675.1 million but is projected at $714.0 million for 2013 -- a 5.6 percent increase. So education funding as a percentage of the county budget has actually dropped.Another point Ritz could have made (but didn't) -- enrollment has been dropping slightly in both systems.

Want an example? Measure 3-401 is the only issue on the Sept. 18  ballot. Steve Kindred,county elections manager, estimates the election could cost around $125,000. Thats real money.But the claim is that the ballot measure will increase our taxes with excessive special elections. Will it?The answer is no. There is no special tax for elections. County residents pay property taxes, which grow at a predetermined rate, and the money pays for various county agencies, including elections. Kindred checked with staff and said nobody there can recall a time when the tax base was raised to cover the cost of additional elections.Just to be on the super safe side, we checked with the county assessor, Bob Vroman. He, too, said that more elections do not translate into higher taxes.Before we rule, we should include what the spokesman for the Clackamas County Democrats said when we put the tax-raising question to him. Remember, this is a statement that went to media outlets and elected officials. It was published in the Clackamas Review.Special elections cost money, thats all it means, said Peter Toll. He added, The county is compelled to run an election at our expense. Its going to cost tax money.Well, then. So much for precision in language, or even giving voters accurate information.Approving Measure 3-401 will not increase taxes. Elections cost taxpayer money, but the election may have been held anyway. Taxes in Clackamas County will go up, but for reasons outside the frequency of elections.We rule the statement False.", "hrefs": "http://www.clackamas.us/elections/special20120918.html"}], "label":

Council Member Victor Gonzales and former City of Austin employee Arthur Sampson.", "For this article, we fact-checked whether Davis was right about the amount of bond money headed to his precinct  and whether the money was spent on his projects because he was quick to point them out.", "On the first front, Davis number stands up.", "The second aspect proved impossible to confirm.", "The Travis County Commissioners Court consists of four commissioners and the county judge, who is elected countywide.", "Each commissioner represents a single precinct, and each precinct is drawn by the commissioners to represent about the same number of residents.", "That means that if bond money were to be distributed evenly among the population, each precinct would get about 25 percent of the funds.", "So, Davis statement that more than 40 percent of the spending authorized in the recent bond vote will happen in a single precinct (his)  for whatever reason  drew our attention.", "Lets look first at the bonds approved by voters.", "Travis County residents voted in November 2011 to give the county permission to borrow about $215 million over seven years for road, drainage and park improvements, as well as land purchases to preserve open space, according to a Nov. 8, 2011,Austin American-Statesmannews article.", "Proposition 1, with $132.8 million in spending, authorized more than two dozen transportation projects to be built, including more than 20 miles of new or expanded roads, the article says.", "Proposition 2 allowed $82.1 million to be spent on eight park projects or land purchases.", "An Oct. 23, 2011, pre-referendumStatesmannews article about Proposition 1 notes that the proposed transportation projects were not evenly spread among the countys precincts.", "The bulk of the sought spending, the article says, would take place in the rapidly developing northeastern part of the county near the 5-year-old Texas 130 tollway.", "But the story did not speak to how much of the overall proposed bonds would support projects in Precinct 1.", "On that front, Davis campaign sent us a spreadsheet detailing the bond proceeds that will be spent in Precinct 1: $90.4 million, which the spreadsheet accurately says is 42 percent of the bond money approved by voters in 2011.", "Specifically, Davis spreadsheet has 19 entries.", "The first 13 are separate Precinct 1 road projects, including more than $12 million to widen part of Blake-Manor Road from two to four lanes and add bike lanes and sidewalks, as well as about $300,000 to add sidewalks to part of Hunters Bend Road.", "The 13 road projects account for more than $70 million of Davis cited $90.4 million.", "The next two entries in the Davis campaigns spreadsheet are estimates  done by Steven Manilla, head of the countys Transportation and Natural Resources Department  of how much Precinct 1 will get from about $5 million in bond money that was approved for road repairs and bike safety projects countywide.", "Manilla estimated that Precinct 1 will get about $3.4 million of that money.", "The final four spreadsheet entries are estimates, also from Manilla, of Precinct 1s share of Proposition 2 bond money, including $10 million to buy land for parks along creeks and rivers and $1.3 million for improvements at East Metro and Webberville parks.", "We spotted a couple of wrinkles in the campaigns breakdown.", "First, we noticed that the Davis campaign lowballed the cost of each of the 13 road projects by using figures not taking into account money included in the bond propositions to cover inflation costs and expenses associated with issuing bonds  meaning Davis analysis undercounts the share of the total bond money going to Precinct 1.", "So, we adjusted the figures in the spreadsheet, which lifted the Precinct 1 share to about 45 percent.", "However, the biggest single expenditure on Davis breakdown, more than $15 million to widen a section of Cameron Road and add bike lanes and sidewalks, reflects spending in neighboring Precinct 2 as well as Precinct 1.", "Manilla told us in an interview thats because that part of Cameron Road, on the western side of Texas 130, is the boundary between the two precincts.", "Removing half of the funding for the Cameron Road project drops the Precinct 1 share a little, to 41 percent  still in line with the over 40 percent that Davis cites.", "Precinct 1s share of the bond money is larger than that of the other precincts, Manilla told us.", "He said Precinct 3, which covers most of the western portion of the county, came in second, with 25 percent of the bond money.", "So, Davis cited percentage holds.", "However, we did not find independent indicators to support, or disprove, his contention that the share of bond money flowing to Precinct 1 reflects his quickness to identify desires.", "In a telephone interview, Davis described himself as a strong advocate who begins thinking well in advance about what projects should be in an upcoming bond package and communicating with county staff members about problems such as traffic congestion and how they can be addressed.", "He identifies what his precinct needs, he said, by listening to residents and assessing what infrastructure projects are necessary to accommodate the development happening in that part of the county.", "Davis also said his quick work to ready projects for the bond package means that when a project in another part of the county falls through, he has something ready to go to fill the opening.", "If you snooze, you lose, he said.", "We asked Davis whether there was a way to document his quick identification of projects for his district and how it has influenced which projects ended up in the 2011 bond package.", "He said the results of his work are reflected in whats on the ballot.", "He also said much of his cited work to ready projects came in responding to and meeting with constituents, which he said he didnt document.", "Manilla, who similarly said Davis reacts quickly to constituent complaints, told us by phone that he did not have a way to document the commissioners quickness to identify potential bond-election items.", "According to Manilla and county documents, items made it onto the 2011 bond election ballot through a process involving more than the commissioners and county judge.", "After the Commissioners Court signed off in December 2010 on preparing for the 2011 bond vote, county staff put together a list of 120 possible bond projects with a total price tag of $638 million.", "A citizens bond advisory committee then shortened the list, which commissioners tweaked before unanimously voting to put the propositions before voters.", "Manilla noted a couple of ways that commissioners can influence the makeup of a bond package, pointing out that commissioners communicate with county staff members about what projects are needed in their precincts.", "He also said commissioners can influence the work of the citizens bond committee through their appointees; each commissioner and the county judge, who leads the Commissioners Court and is elected countywide, selects three people to serve on the committee.", "And, of course, commissioners ultimately vote to put the projects before voters and can make changes to the final list.", "At theirAug.", "9, 2011,

He faces Clackamas County Commission chairwoman Charlotte Lehan, county commissioner Paul Savas and state Rep. Dave Hunt in Tuesdays election.Snubbing PERS is a nice symbolic pledge for someone running on a platform of limited government. It also wont hurt Ludlow, who is 63 years old, as much as it would someone who is further away from retirement.But the next part of Ludlows claim really caught our attention. Ina Facebook postdated March 30, he wrote, I am happy to decline PERS so that the County can save over $30,000 per year that would have been paid on my behalf. (The post was changed Tuesday; well explain below.)That sounded like a lot of money saved, given that a county commissioners annual salary is $81,000. We checked it out. In doing so, Ludlow clarified to PolitiFact Oregon andon Facebookthat by declining PERS, the County can save over $68,000 over a four year term that would have been paid on my behalf.We asked Ludlow why he had claimed $30,000 in savings a year, and now $68,000 over four years. He said its hard getting solid numbers from the Public Employees Retirement System. I am now satisfied that the last numbers quoted by me are the correct numbers, he wrote us.Hmmm. We dont think politicians, aspiring or otherwise, should claim savings without evidence. Thats careless.But lets get back to how much county taxpayers will save should Ludlow decline retirement benefits. The county position pays $80,868 a yearThis is how public retirement payments work: Every employer pays a contribution rate, depending on the type of employer and type of employee. The rates are set in advance. In the case of Clackamas County, theemployer contribution rate is 11.99 percent for general service workers for the 2011-13 budget period.The 11.99 percent includes 6.13 percent that the employer puts in for a members retirement, plus 5.86 percent to cover the systems unfunded actuarial liability, or the money needed to pay for current and future retirees. In addition, the county pays -- or picks up -- the 6 percent the employee is required to contribute on his or her behalf.That adds up to $14,500 a year. But David Crosley, a spokesman for PERS, said the actual amount of money saved -- or avoided -- should Ludlow decline is closer to $9,800 a year, or a little more than $39,000 over four years.Thats because the county needs to kick in for unfunded actuarial liability anyway, regardless of whether Ludlow declines PERS for himself. That amount gets spread over fewer people, Crosley said. Theyre not saving that in the long term.But lets look at this from the countys perspective, which is what Ludlow relies on. Marc Gonzales, the countys finance director, confirmed the county budgets about $17,247 a year per commissioner for retirement-related costs.Why is it higher? In part, because the county calculates the figure with longer-term employees in mind, and they have higher retirement costs. Tim Heider, a spokesman for Clackamas County, wrote in an email that the county would not incur any PERS cost for an employee who declines enrollment.So weve gone from $30,000 a year to roughly $17,000 a year to $9,800 a year. Its undeniable that Ludlow will save taxpayers money by declining to join PERS, should he win. But hes off on how much, and whether it would have been paid on his behalf.Its certainly not the $30,000 a year he originally claimed. It may be $17,000 as he now claims, but thats because the county has budgeted generously. (Ludlow as a new member will not cost taxpayers as much as employees who have been in the system for a long time.)

The deals create the possibility that the county will have higher payouts for pensions and vacations in future years, but that is not certain.

So, buses were less safe this year than in 2009, but more safe this year than in 2010.But if you look at the last two years mentioned by Abele, and compare the responses from the previous two years, they are up slightly, about 4 percent.All responses:Counting all instances when police and/or private security was needed, incidents went up the last two years. This year, compared to 2009, they are up more than 13 percent.Those are the broad numbers for police and private security responses. But there are hundreds of non-criminal episodes such as fare disputes included, though, so lets take a closer look at the violent incidents.Assaults and verbal altercations against passengers:Security was called-- and law enforcement sometimes dispatched --  in 150 such cases in 2011, up from 139 in 2010 and 106 in 2009. Thats two years in a row of increases, though it moderated in 2011, according to areport MCTSranfor us.Assaults against drivers:This counts drivers struck by a person, but mainly by objects or fluids (such as spittle). There were 29 such incidents in 2009, 24 in 2010 and 25 this year. Its fallen off more compared to 35 in 2008. There were six drivers struck by individuals in 2011, though not all of these cases were serious enough to warrant medical attention.Non-violent lawbreaking:We only have two years of data here. It was virtually unchanged at nearly 900 incidents per year, this category includes threats, weapons incidents, off-bus fights and disorderly conduct, vandalism and profane/drunken behavior. The number represents how many time private security -- and police in some cases -- were called in.Those are the numbers.A transit spokeswoman sees no red flags in the fluctuations and mixed trends.Theres not an increase in crime, theres an increase in attention, said Jacqueline Janz of MCTS.The numbers are a bit of a mixed bag, but show lawbreaking and violence is a consistent, if relatively uncommon, phenomenon on county buses that -- MCTS officials are quick to point out -- provide 44 million passenger trips a year on 411 buses, most without incident.Broadly speaking, its happening less now than five years ago, but more than it was two years ago, based on total responses by police and security. The Abele statement we are checking referred to the last two years.Assaults on drivers are notably down over two to three years.But looking at the broadest measure of serious problems (altercations among passengers), the history shows a significant increase two years in a row. Thats the time frame Abele referred to, and we think Clarkes critique focuses mainly on these kind of serious incidents.To be sure, theres no dramatic swing up, as Clarkes rhetoric implied. And the picture improves when the longer view is taken, though as we noted thats selectively taking a high point as the starting point.But Abeles claim about buses being no less safe than a year or two ago flies in the face of the passenger altercation stats. Plus, Abele makes use of overly broad incident numbers that are highly misleading as a measure of crime.Theres enough counter evidence -- the declining number of bus drivers struck -- to give Abeles claim an element of truth. But it also gives a wrong impression.That is our definition of Mostly False.", "hrefs": "http://www.cbs58.com/news/local-news/More-Bus-Violence-135710028.html?skipthumb=Y"}], "label": "half-flip"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/aug/05/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/wisconsin-manufacturers-commerce-says-brown-county/", "title": "When Nancy Nusbaum was Brown County executive, spending went up nearly 50 percent.", "author": "Dave Umhoefer", "posted": "08/05/2011", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["As she campaigns to upend GOP state Sen.

Well, it depends on how you think of cuts.People understand the concept of a pay cut: You have less money to spend or save. The county, though, has more money to spend so it hasnt faced 11 straight years of that sort of cut.But the county considers reducing services a cut. It rolls back services if there is a gap between projected ongoing revenue and projected ongoing expenses. Projected expenses means the money needed to maintain current service levels.So even though the actual dollar amount available for FY 2012 is more than for FY 2011, the county budget people say they are facing cuts, either to direct services or to staff.The March revenue forecast shows a projected $4.4 million gap between revenues and expenditures-- or a difference of a little more than 1 percent -- in the operating budget for fiscal year 2012, which starts July 1.No doubt the county has had to make cuts over the years, maybe in some department every single year, but Multnomah County also has added programs, has expanded programs and has paid more for raises, health insurance and cost-of-living increases for much of the past decade.Cogen strenuously disagrees with our definition. He said most people see cuts not in terms of fewer dollars, but fewer services.

Multnomah County has consistently received more money in the general fund with few exceptions. We dont think of that as more than a decade of cuts.We believe Cogen when he says he takes his integrity seriously. And we recognize that the county is restricted by the cap on property taxes.

Like Walker, Stone has long been an active supporter of a photo ID requirement for voting.The most notable difference: public transit.Walker has been cool to expanding public transit for years, while Stone has made a regional transportation approach his signature issue.Hes been a great transit advocate for a decade, Kerry Thomas, interim executive director of Transit Now, a southeastern Wisconsin advocacy group, said of Stone.There are limits to Stones support of new transportation options; he has spurned light rail, and he agreed with Walkers stance against federal help for a high-speed train.But Stone was a leading force behind creation of the Regional Transit Authority focused on commuter rail, and he has backed buses, and some -- but by no means all -- proposals for new funding options for public transit. Walker has taken a much tougher line against transit and new taxes or fees to pay for it. Stone is pledging an end to bus cuts seen under Walker and Ament.Stone, like Walker, has backed freeway expansion.Experience:Stone emphatically says he is his own person and is going to do it my way.We asked him for examples of where he has broken with Walker -- and how his voting record compares.He offered no criticism of Walker and pointed to no particular votes where they parted. But he notes correctly that hes made a priority of regional transit, in contrast to Walker.Their biggest difference, Stone said, is vastly different life experiences and what weve done in our career. Stone has run a small printing company, while Walker worked briefly in the private sector before winning election.He suggests that he will be more pragmatic and collegial than Walker.I have a very different way of managing and doing business that Scott Walker, he said ata candidate forum.Stone has made a point of saying he will try to get along with the County Board and work with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.Lets review.Abeles strongest evidence comes from Stone himself, who has aligned himself closely with Walkers agenda and politics. Their voting histories are very similar, and they win very similar ratings from interest groups.They are not indistinguishable, though: The transit issue illustrates Stones willingness to step out from Republican orthodoxy and work behind the scenes in a bipartisan fashion -- neither of which are Walker trademarks. Stones business experience is a notable biographical difference.In the end, Abeles equation (Stone = Walker) scores out as Mostly True.", "hrefs": "http://www.jsonline.mobi/more/news/117435803.htm"}], "label": "barely-true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/feb/11/jeff-stone/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-jeff-stone-sa/", "title": "Im the only candidate for Milwaukee County executive that has voted against increasing government pensions.", "author": "Dave Umhoefer", "posted": "02/11/2011", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["For a scandal that destroyed the political careers of several top Milwaukee County politicians, the 2002 pension deal seems a surprising afterthought in the 2011 county executive campaign.Have voters forgotten about the whole mess overseen by F.

company -- received $350,000 from FIRST fund and $1.5 million from other state and local incentive programs. Gartner plans to hire 200 people, starting in 2011 and continuing through 2015. The jobs are expected to have an average annual wage of $60,000. June 2009: Paramount Transportation Logistics Services Inc. was given $300,000 from the FIRST fund and $300,000 from other local and state programs to create 100 jobs with an average wage of $48,500 by 2012. About 36 people had been hired by the end of June, the most recent data available. July 2009: Source Interlink Cos. -- a magazine publisher and distributor -- receives $1 million from the FIRST  fund as part of plan to add 350 jobs by 2011, but the hiring schedule has been revised. The company now expects to begin hiring this year, adding about 50 jobs. The added jobs will have an average annual wage of $65,000. February 2010: Algenol Inc. was awarded $10 million in FIRST funds to build a biofuel research facility off Alico Road in south Lee County. Unlike the other incentive agreements, the deal with Algenol is not tied directly to job targets, but the company now employs 67 people. About 30 of those employees have transferred from Baltimore. The center expects to eventually employ more than 100, with an average annual wage of $85,000.Those numbers add up to about 750 jobs to be created through 2015, but just more than 100 people have been hired so far, according to the latest information from Lees Economic Development Office.So where did Hall get the 1,200 number?If you look at the countys information, those are the jobs being created, Hall said.But not just by the FIRST funds.Hall said she asked the Economic Development Office for information on the projects funded through FIRST. She said the numbers she got back apparently reflect all job incentive programs.I guess they put everything together, Hall said. Its misspoken to say it is all from FIRST, but the numbers are correct.Lee County constructs incentive agreements using a variety of programs, including the Lee County Job Opportunity Program, which can pay up to $6,000 per full-time job and a similar Florida program, the Qualified Targeted Industry Refund Program, which pays tax refunds of up to $3,000 for each full-time job.If you include incentive agreements using those programs, the county has announced agreements  that total 1,048 jobs through 2015.About 189 people have been hired so far.Is a job pledged the same as a job created?We are creating those jobs under contract, Hall said. We are very proud of the progress we have started to achieve.I think the message is that we are out there, doing our part as government to allow those jobs to accumulate, she said.Does FIRST INITIATIVE -- Economic incentive program created over 1,200 high wage jobs since 2009 accurately convey that message and the facts? The number of jobs created is overstated by about 38 percent and most remain unfilled now. Also, the FIRST INITIATIVE program isnt the only source of incentive money being used.
