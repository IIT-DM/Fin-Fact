to buy out  a voluntary program  to buy out retirees when theyre retiring at 60% of what their pensions would be,Pritzker said.", "People are choosing to take the money up front.", "Its saving the

"He didnt provide a timeframe for those savings, nor was it clear from his remarks which program he was describing or what study determined it could save the state billions.", "So we decided to find out.", "In response to our inquiry, Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said the governor was referencing two programs that allow some participants in the states three largest retirement systems to forego certain benefits in exchange for an upfront payment.", "Both buyout programs were created as part ofthe 2018 state budgetand were extended inthe budget Pritzker signed this yearto June 30, 2024 from their original sunset date in mid-2021.", "But each program is more limited than what the governor described.", "One program allows people who formerly worked for the state  including its public schools and universities  long enough to qualify for a state pension and who have not yet begun to draw from it to trade all rights to a future retirement benefit in exchange for a lump sum equal to 60% of the total lifetime pension they would have received.", "Despite being a total buyout worth the same percentage Pritzker referenced, this program applies to a much smaller subset of state retirement system members than his comment suggests.", "The other program permits retiring members who were hired before 2011 to trade the 3% compounded automatic annual increase to which they are entitled under the states two-tiered pension structure for an annual increase of 1.5% on the original value of their pension, which would not be compounded.", "In exchange, they receive a lump sum equal to 70% of the difference between the value of the higher and lower annual increases.", "In short, it is not a total pension buyout.", "So far, participation and cost savings associated with both programs has been limited.", "Out of 3,600 qualified inactive members of the State Employees Retirement System (SERS), which covers state employees who do not work in public education or for the judicial and legislative branches, 22 have elected to take a total buyout since it became an option for those members in 2018, according to a spokesman.", "At the Teachers Retirement System of

schools outside Chicago, 596  or 16%  of the systems 3,715 eligible retiring members opted for it this year.", "For context, however, there are roughly 61,000 retired SERS members and 64,000 current employees.", "TRS, the states largest system, has about 112,000 retirees currently drawing benefits and 163,000 current employees.", "The statement makes it sound like a large portion of people are taking these options and its important to realize that its a limited pool whos even eligible for these buyout programs, said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago and an expert on state and local pensions.", "We did not receive a response from the third major state pension fund, the State Universities Retirement System, by publication time.", "As for Pritzkers contention that the buyouts would save the state billions, his spokeswoman said the governor was presented with an independent analysis that came to that conclusion.", "However, she declined to provide the study itself or offer any further details about where it came from and what it was based on.", "The governor was referencing a proprietary study conducted by and for an outside organization that he was presented, Abudayyeh wrote in an email.", "It determined that pension buyouts, depending on the structure of the options, have the potential to save billions, including as much as roughly $25 billion.", "The administration has not yet determined its estimate, nor did the governor say that this was the administrations estimate for how much money buyouts are currently saving or will save.", "Without access to the study, we cannot confirm Pritzkers comments square with its findings.", "This July, however, a budget watchdog grouppublished an analysisfinding the programs had generated relatively minor savings in the last fiscal year.", "While the programs were expected to save the state more than $400 million that year, they generated

director with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said they questioned whether the Kiplinger rankings took into account that local governments in Georgia can levy up to a 4 percent sales tax, including on groceries.", "Davis said those taxes on groceries could be more significant to seniors than the state's estate tax exemption.", "He also expressed concern that the most-to-least

pension or a very high-income person living off their investments, Davis said.", "Kiplinger, he said, appeared to have used a subjective process to evaluate the states, something Sandra Block, senior associate editor at Kiplingers Personal Finance acknowledged.", "The fact that they did not assign formal weights to different tax parameters is problematic and makes a full review of their rankings impossible, Davis said.", "Block said its precisely because retirees are a very diverse group that were reluctant to assign weights to different types of taxes.", "Instead, we try to provide as much information as we can on the taxes most seniors pay so that individuals can draw their own conclusions, Block said.", "Francis and Davis said state tax policies arent likely to be a retirees primary consideration in deciding where to live.", "Other things are going to matter more -- chiefly housing and energy costs, Davis said, adding that those are likely a retirees two biggest expenses.",

for the Rhode Island plans were always within 1 percentage point of the median.", "Magaziner's campaign also offered as evidence an analysis comparing Rhode Island's rates of return (based on reports

fiscal years of Caprios tenure.", "By that measure, it's Magaziner's criticism that underperforms.", "In response, Caprio noted that the overall rate of return for the three fiscal years he served as treasurer was -4.63 percent, compared to the State Street's benchmark of -5.28 percent, which means that the state lost less money than the benchmark during the recession.", "Magaziner's campaign

payments and the amounts the workers would have gotten if their pension fund were in fine health.", "This was not just benevolence.", "By agreeing to the top-up, GM was able to hand off Delphi

America.", "But GM and Treasurys auto team left the salaried retiree pensions alone.", "The non-union retirees would get no top-up.", "As a result, those retirees would only collect 30 percent to 70 percent of their expected pensions, which would be paid by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., or PBGC, the federal agency that takes over failing pension plans.", "Was this fair?", "Turner and other lawmakers from auto states said no, as did Delphi retirees.", "They said that despite the pre-existing top-up agreements, GMs bankruptcy gave the automaker the right to rewrite the top-up contracts, just as it rewrote a number of unrelated terms with the unions consent.", "Even better, they said, GM and Treasury could have worked out a way to make all Delphi retirees whole.", "But that didnt happen.", "There were winners (the union) and losers (the non-union retirees), and that looked like political favoritism and backroom dealing to Turner and other critics.", "But in 2012, congressional testimony and GAO reports led PolitiFact Ohio to conclude that Treasury and GM made the decision because: (a) the union had long-standing top-up agreements and salaried retirees did not, and (b) any attempt to end those agreements would have caused the UAW to balk or even strike.", "Treasury maintained that it was vital to get GM stabilized quickly, and an interruption to its ability to get parts for its cars -- due to labor unrest -- could be fatal.", "There was nothing to back up Turners claim that the top-up decision was made because of political favoritism and backroom dealing.", "The GAO said that court filings and statements from GM and Treasury officials support that Treasury deferred to GMs business judgment.", "Based on this, PolitiFact Ohio gave Turners claim a Mostly False

Scott Walker is used to hearing cheers from conservative audiences when highlighting fiscal constraints he put on Wisconsins budget in 2011.He seemed a bit surprised, though, during his November 2012address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Librarywhen scattered applause broke out after he mentioned the states pension fund.Walker was comparing Wisconsins fiscal condition to that of California and of his standard punching bag, Illinois, which raised taxes to close a budget gap.They have a pension system thats not even halfway funded, Walkersaidof the Land of Lincoln. Now, in contrast, in our state, our pension system is the only one in the country (thats) 100 percent funded.Hearing some applause, Walker added: You can clap for that, sure.In 2011, much attention centered on the mandate by Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature that most public employees pay a larger share of their pension costs. It was part of Walkers controversial drive to sharply curtail collective bargaining by public-sector unions.The health of the state-run Wisconsin Retirement System -- which serves some 166,000 retirees and 260,000 active workers, including teachers, state and municipal employees -- has received less attention.And though Walker made the statement awhile back, its worth a look as we enter into the new budget season.Is Wisconsins pension system the only one in the nation thats fully funded?To evaluate the claim, well examine the two most recent years with complete data, 2010 and 2011.The number were looking at is the funded ratio -- the ratio of a pension plans assets to its liabilities. Its one key measure of whether a fund can meet all its future obligations. It varies with investment gains and losses, changes in benefits and other factors.A ratio of 100 percent means the fund -- at least as of that moment -- is in position to pay future retirees all their expected benefits.At the end of fiscal year 2010, which began before Walker took office, only Wisconsin had a fully funded pension plan (100 percent), the Pew Center on the States concluded in a widely citedJune 2012 report.Walker spoke of the report at that time, and while its a bit dated, the report is of recent vintage.The Pew study noted that 34 state-run plans were below the 80 percent threshold that experts say is the minimum for a healthy system.There was a tiny bit of rounding in the determination that Wisconsin was 100 percent funded. The actual percentage at the end of 2010, Pew found, was 99.84 percent.The Pew Center considers that so close to 100 percent that it constitutes full funding, said Pew senior researcher David Draine.All told, the Pew report cited a $757 billion pension funding gap among the states on liabilities of $3 trillion, noting serious concerns about funding levels in 32 states.Illinois was lowest among the states at 45 percent in 2010.We found other evidence that backed up the ranking of Wisconsin as best-funded among state plans.That included a 2012 report byMorningstar, and a survey by theNational Association of State Retirement Administratorsusing 2011 data that had Wisconsin as the highest-ranking state-run plan for general employees.

Senate floor.That mixture of underfunding and high benefit is a sure recipe for disaster, both for the jurists promised the pension and also our hard-working taxpayers who would be on the hook if this system fails.As PolitiFact New Jersey learned, Turners recipe isnt missing any ingredients.Of the five major pension funds, the Judicial Retirement System has the lowest percentage of funds necessary to meet future pension obligations, according to the latest data from the state Department of the Treasury.At the same time, judges, on average, are receiving the largest annual pensions of all public employees in those systems, according to Treasury data.First, lets address how the Judicial Retirement System is underfunded.As of July 1, 2011, the system had about $305 million in assets, but had accrued nearly $586 million in long-term liabilities.", "In other words, the state only had roughly 52 percent of the money needed to fulfill its obligations.That percentage represents the lowest amount of the five major pension funds.Now, well talk about the pension amounts paid to judges.The average annual benefit among all retirees in the Judicial Retirement System was $90,837 as of July 1, 2011, and more than $100,000 for those who retired in the preceding year.", "Those pensions represent the highest benefits among public employees in the five major systems.By comparison, the Public Employees Retirement System, which includes both state and local government employees, provided an average annual benefit of $22,486 among all state retirees and $32,495 for new state retirees.Our rulingIn a speech Monday on the Senate floor, Turner said: The judicial system is the most underfunded in this state, able to only pay 52 percent of its obligations.", "Meanwhile, judges get some of the richest pensions of all public employees.The senators claim is on target.", "The Judicial Retirement System has about 52 percent of the funds needed to meet future pension obligations, marking the

Coburn, R-Oklahoma.We checked Wastebook 2011, which indeed mentions over $601 million paid out to deceased federal workers in the last five years, with footnotes citing the source: a report issued by the U.S. Office of Personnel Managements Office of the Inspector General, titled, appropriately enough, Stopping Improper Payments to Deceased Annuitants.According to the Office of Personnel Managements report, the amount of post-death improper payments is consistently $100-$150 million annually.Some of what the federal government calls improper payments is outright fraud -- people with electronic access to the deceaseds bank accounts taking the money. And some of it is because the money was electronically transferred into what are now inactive bank accounts. The money can sit there piling up for years before anyone notices.Special efforts have been under way since at least 2005 to reduce payments going to dead retirees and their survivors, the report says. Those efforts have included matching the rolls of eligible recipients with the Social Security Administrations death records on a weekly and annual basis, doing similar checks with the IRS to see whos still filing returns, and random phone calls to retirees over 90 years old just to make sure theyre still around.Those steps have helped identify the scope of the problem, Susan L. Ruge, a spokeswoman in the Office of Personnel Managements inspector generals office, said in an e-mail. In fiscal year 2010, for instance, the office identified $116.8 million in improper payments going to dead retirees or survivors.But solving the problem is another matter.According to the Personnel Managements report: There remains a high probability that egregious loss of monies from the [civil service] fund will continue and require strategic corrective actions.  It notes one case of a man illegally pocketing more than $515,000 by cashing in his dead fathers monthly retirement checks -- for 37 years.Ruge said 94 percent of annuity payments are transferred electronically into bank accounts as opposed to the older method of mailing checks. The office of inspector general, she said, has no breakdown as to payments stolen by others with access to those accounts and money lost by languishing into those unattended accounts.In overpayment cases where no theft has occurred, there is greater potential for EFT (electronic fund transfer) overpayments to continue undetected, simply because no one is monitoring the deceased annuitants bank account, said Ruge.If there is good news in any of this it is this: while $601 million going to dead people in the last five years sounds like a lot of money, it represents less than 2.5 percent of all civil service retirement disbursements, the report claims.Our RulingDohertys website says Over the past five years the federal government has paid out $601 million in retirement and disability benefits to deceased former federal employees.The campaign accurately quoted a figure whose source is a report issued by the U.S. Office of Personnel Managements Office of the Inspector General.We rate his statement True.Rhode Islands former top cop is setting his bar of expectation pretty high if hes promising to curb this kind of  rampant fraud and waste.

instruction to pay their $1 billion bill for teacher pensions over the next two budget years.Localities are paying a collective $472 million for teacher pensions during the current budget biennium,

$530 million more on teacher pensions during the next two years then they did in the past biennium.", "To comply, McEachin says localities would be forced to cut their education budgets.McEachin is mistaken.", "Teacher pensions are already part of local school budgets.", "Increased retirement payments would not cause the bottom lines of local education budgets to fall.", "To the contrary, each locality would have to decide how to pay for a rising expense.Democrats, speaking for McEachin, say the only realistic option for cities and counties would be to cut other education programs and many may go in that direction.", "But there are options: some municipalities could decide to raise taxes; others might opt to increase their school budgets by reducing spending for non-education services.No doubt, McDonnells budget would force most localities to adjust priorities.", "But it does not cut the overall state appropriation to public education nor the revenues localities use to pay

(She would use the lower, more conservative, number in her calculation.)Baldelli-Hunt said a financial consultant who was with her at the meeting also recalls a number of over 400,000 and we nearly fell off our seats when we heard that, and that put in perspective how Rhode Islanders are struggling.On Nov. 17, when the pension proposal was being debated, Baldelli-Hunt took that number and divided it by 554,870, a number her financial consultant pulled off the Internet that was supposed to represent the number of 2010 tax returns filed with the state.The calculation gives you 84.3 percent.Thats how she arrived at her 85-percent figure.First of all, 554,870 is not the number of 2010 tax returns. Its actually the number of 2009 returns filed by early June of 2010. Also, it includes the returns of people who dont live in Rhode Island.When we called Raimondo's office and also Paul Dion, chief of the state's Office of Revenue Analysis, they referred us to the final report onresident income tax returnsfor the tax year 2009. Both said it was the most recent data that breaks down the returns by income category.That report paints a very different picture.It says the state received 483,392 returns from Rhode Island residents that year, with 230,289 reporting incomes of less than $30,000.That's 48 percent, not 85 percent.We were curious whether it made a difference to include thetax returns of non-residents, including people who live out of the state but who file here because they work here. Of the 91,231 non-residents who filed in 2009, 27,818 earned under $30,000. Folding those number into the mix brought the percentage down to 45 percent.Baldelli-Hunt said she is sure of what she heard from the treasurer. Perhaps, she speculated, when Raimondo was looking at the number of returns reporting income of less than $30,000, her eye mistakenly jumped one column to the left, to the 483,392 number, which is the total number of returns.The correct percentage -- 48 percent -- still means that half of working people in the state make $30,000 or less, she said. It's almost shocking.Raimondo spokesman Joy Fox, who was not at the meeting, said the treasurer always uses the 2009 statistics and no one can recall giving Baldelli-Hunt different information.Our rulingWe can't say whether Baldelli-Hunt is accurately recalling something she heard from Raimondo. There is no audio recording of the meeting.We can only rule on the accuracy of Baldelli-Hunt's statement when she said that 85 percent of Rhode Island tax returns, filed for the 2010 tax year, reported income of $30,000 or less.The most-recent income data, from 2009, show that the ratio is 48 percent, far less than what she stated. (The state isn't scheduled to release an income breakdown of its 2010 returns until sometime around March 2012.)That 48 percent turns out to be fairly typical.State reports from 2005-2008show that the percentage doesn't change much year to year, so it seems extraordinarily unlikely that even when the 2010 tax return numbers come out, the percentage will jump to anything close to 85 percent.Carl Sagan, the late astronomer, liked to say that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. We agree.Baldelli-Hunt described the statistic was pretty astonishing. It would have served her well to double-check it before using it during debate on the biggest issue to come before the General Assembly this year.Her assertion that 85 percent of tax returns report income of $30,000 or less -- based on a hasty calculation --  is not only false but ridiculous, we rule her statementPants on Fire.(Get updates fromPolitiFactRI on Twitter.

It requires the Postal Service to do whats called prefund 100 percent of the health benefits for its future retirees.  The cost: About $5 billion a year until 2017.This is how it works.

The USPS could go out of business, sticking the federal government with a bill it cannot pay. This could force the entire federal retiree health program to go broke, the OPM report argued.Now, lets look at Bishops claim.Federal employers:Under the current retirement system, all federal employers, including the Postal Service, must prefund their pension benefits. And as we explained earlier, the USPS does have unique health benefit funding rules.Its therefore accurate that under the current retirement system, no federal employer aside from the Postal Service must prefund 100 percent of both its retiree health and pension benefits.State and local governments:No federal or state rules require state or local governments to fully fund pension or health benefits, said Keith Brainard, director of research for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.None of the experts we interviewed had heard of cities, towns or counties with health prefunding requirements.Private industry:By federal law, private companies must fund their pensions fully, and catch up over time if they fall behind. They dont have to prefund retiree health benefits.This means theres no reason to go postal over the claim by Bishop and others that no other public or private business in America except for the USPS must fund 100 percent of employee pension and retirement health costs in advance.By and large, this statement fits the evidence.We do take some issue with the claims broader point, which is that the retirement funding requirement unfairly singles out the post office.

One of the sources she supplied to us was a story on WPRI.com with this headline:RI pension fund in worst shape of all, Pew suggests.But the story compared the 2010 funding level for Rhode Island with Pew data from other states from 2009, when Rhode Island wasn't the worst at all -- five states had less cash in 2009 to cover their pension obligations than Rhode Island (which was at 59 percent). Illinois ranked the worst, funded at 51 percent.The WPRI story noted what the headline didn't: that it was using data from different years. Yet whenother websitespicked up the WPRI headline, the storys caveats were dropped.Glover's sources included one such item,a five-paragraph storyfrom BusinessInsider.com headlined, Rhode Island's Pension Liabilities Are Now The Worst In the Country that combined the WPRI story withan error-filled chartthat, it said, came from Boston College's Center for Retirement Research.When we went directly tothe Boston College databaseand ran our own calculations, we found that it put Rhode Island pensions as being funded at 62 percent in 2009, not 48 percent as Business Insider reported. (And instead of being the worst in the country,Rhode Island was ranked ninth from the bottom, a better ranking than the Pew report.)So what do the latest numbers show?At Pew, research director Kil Huh said the organization is still gathering 2010 data. The latest tallies from 4 of the 10-worst states haven't been released.But Illinois' numbers, published in July, show that state has dropped to a funding level of 45 percent, keeping it at the bottom of the list -- so far. Two states that had worse numbers than Rhode Island in Pew's report on the 2009 numbers -- West Virginia and Oklahoma -- have not released their latest statistics.So why did the funding percentages fall in 2010?Huh said it probably comes from the lingering impact of the recession, which keeps pulling down the amount of money pension funds have been earning over the last five years. The states are still accounting for the significant losses they experienced in the fall of 2008.And in Rhode Island, the state retirement board voted in April to scale back its predicted rate of return for its pension investment portfolio. The assumed rate of return had been 8.25 percent per year; the board adjusted that to 7.5 percent. (The actual market return over the last 10 years has been 5.74 percent; 1.52 percent in the past 5 years.)Glover also referred us to a recent Washington Post story that paraphrased Raimondo as saying that Rhode Island has the nations worst-funded pension system. (We also found a New York Times story that did the same thing.) But neither quoted her directly, and the Post story cited a per-capita comparison, not a funding level comparison.Raimondo did make such a statement in theFeb. 24, 2011 edition of PBS NewsHour, saying the state had the highest unfunded liability per capita of any state in the country.But more recently, says Raimondos office, the treasurer has consistently characterized the funding level as one of the worst in the nation or one of the worst per capita. A search of Providence Journal stories supports that.", "hrefs": "http://www.920whjj.com/cc-common/podcast/single_page.html?more_page=1&podcast=helenglover&selected_podcast=katzpodcast_1319457915_28483.mp3"}, {"sentence": "(However, after this report was published,Bob Plain of WPROproduceda tapefrom Sept. 8, 2011, in which the treasurer clearly and repeatedly characterized the funding of the state's pension system as the worst, with the highest unfunded liability per capita.)", "hrefs": "http://www.630wpro.com/Article.asp?id=2322761&spid=41143"}, {"sentence": "Our rulingHelen Glover said Rhode Island's pension system is the mostly poorly funded in the U.S.Her statement was based on sources that either misread the numbers or mixed old data with new.Using the latest 2010 numbers from Pew, Rhode Island ranks no lower than second from the bottom, and the state's standing may improve as other states report their figures.And when we sought out other sources, such as Moody's and Boston College, we couldn't find any ranking that put Rhode Island at the bottom of the barrel when it came to pension funding.That doesn't detract from Rhode Island's profoundly perilous pension problem.But being in last place is a very specific distinction, and we're not there -- yet.Because Glover was so definitive, we rule that her statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- PolitiFact's definition ofMostly False.(Get updates fromPolitiFactRI on Twitter.
