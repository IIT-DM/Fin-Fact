which is short of the $8 trillion Bush mentioned.", "But remember that Bush said Obamawill addthat much on his watch, which can be reasonably interpreted to mean the amount by the end of Obamas second term.", "If the debt continues to rise at the same pace it has increased over the past seven-plus years, it will end up at nearly $8.4 trillion when Obama leaves office.", "Using this measurement, then, Bush is right that Obama will see the debt increase by north of $8 trillion on his watch, and that this amount will exceed the amount accumulated by the previous 43 presidents ($6.31 trillion).", "Bush isnt correct, however, using gross federal debt.", "Using the same method of estimating, Obama should see an increase of $9.51 trillion in gross federal debt by the end of his second term.", "Thats less than the $10.63 trillion he inherited from his 43 predecessors.", "Experts say that either publicly held debt or gross federal debt could be used to define the term national debt that Bush uses.", "Still, economists told us that publicly held debt is often the most popular measurement among specialists, so we wont quibble with Bushs decision to focus on publicly held debt.", "The size of debt production under Obama is reinforced by looking at debt as a percentage of gross domestic product.", "At the end of fiscal year 2008, publicly held debt accounted for 39 percent of gross domestic product.", "By the end of fiscal year 2016, its expected to be almost 77 percent.", "Even if bad timing has exaggerated this increase  -- fiscal 2008 ended four months before Obama took office, right as the economy was collapsing -- its certainly a big percentage jump over eight years.", "All this said, well note a few things that are important to keep in mind.", "How much blame does Obama deserve?Bush makes it sound as if Obama simply flipped a switch and debt started pouring out.", "Obviously, its a lot more complicated than that.", "It isnt as if we were projecting balanced budgets and Barack Obama came into office and signed legislation increasing spending and cutting taxes, said Marc Goldwein, a budget analyst at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.", "In fact, Goldwein said, the January 2009 estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the debt would be around $9 trillion today.", "So Obama could -- at most -- be assigned the blame for adding an additional $4.5 trillion to the debt, and thats only if you absolve Congress (which has been controlled by Republicans for most of his tenure) of any responsibility, and if you blame Obama for all of the long-lasting effects of the recession that he inherited.", "Also, a lot of the debt comes from entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, which are increasing largely on autopilot due to demographic trends that are out of any presidents control.", "So while Obama does bear some responsibility for the debt accumulation on his watch, he certainly doesnt deserve sole responsibility.", "Bushs own party played a role, too, as did the inevitable grind of demographic trends.", "Any president today would be in much the same situation.Another type of inevitable grind -- inflation -- is worth factoring in as well.", "Every year, inflation puts an upward pressure on the scale of the debt.", "Inflation erodes the numbers and makes them a bit meaningless, Goldwein said.", "For a comparison, lets take a look at Obamas predecessor in the White House, George W. Bush -- a Republican, and Jeb Bushs brother.", "The Debt to the Penny calculator doesnt offer daily tallies for publicly held debt around the time of Bushs inauguration, but it does offer daily data for gross federal debt, so well use that.", "When Bush came into office on Jan. 20, 2001, the gross federal debt stood at $5.73 trillion.", "At the end of Bushs term eight years later, the debt had risen to $10.63 trillion -- an increase on Bushs watch of $4.9 trillion.", "Thats not quite equal to what his 42 presidential predecessors accumulated, but its 86 percent of the way there.", "That increase under Bush is a little smaller than the expected increase during Obamas full tenure -- 89 percent -- but its not off by much.", "Our ruling Bush said that Obama will somehow manage to add more than $8 trillion to the national debt, which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together.", "On the numbers, Bush is right, as long as you measure the nations publicly held debt, the most commonly cited statistic, and as long as you project forward to the end of Obamas tenure.", "But Bush leaves out some important context when he focuses the blame solely on Obama, and when he ignores that the percentage increase in the debt under George W.

According to the analysis, U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., had asked the service what would happen to the health care laws implementation in the event of a lapse in appropriation funding, resulting in a government shutdown. The service replied that substantial implementation might continue because the government could draw on other funding sources and agencies are permitted to continue to perform certain activities even if appropriations are stalled. Also, the service, said, after the government asked Congress for more than $1 billion to implement Obamacare provisions in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2013, no such money was appropriated; the government found the dollars from other federal kitties. If Congress similarly resisted an administration request for $1.4 billion in implementation money in fiscal 2014, the service said, it seems likely that the administration will continue to rely on alternative sources of funding to support Obamacare activities.", "hrefs": "http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?a=Files.Serve&File_id=0af8b42a-b2b9-484b-b0d4-9d27e2b690ac"}, {"sentence": "Click here formoreon the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "hrefs": "https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/"}], "label": "half-true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/dec/06/debra-medina/texas-near-top-local-debt-capita/", "title": "At present spending levels, only citizens of New York have a greater local debt burden than Texans.", "author": "Sue Owen", "posted": "12/06/2013", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["In a Nov. 13, 2013, campaignpress release, Debra Medina pledged that as Texas state comptroller she would resist growth in government spending, saying, At present spending levels, only citizens of New York have a greater local debt burden than Texans.", "An earlier version of the claim sent out viaemailsaid simply greater debt burden, not local; the campaign posted an updated release online.", "We looked at state debt in a July 24, 2011, fact-check on Gov.", "Rick Perry, rating asMostly Truehis claim that Texas had the fourth-lowest debt per capita of any state in the nation, and we are the lowest of any of the big states.", "How does debt shake out at the local level?", "Medina, a tea-party favorite from Wharton, got 19 percent of the vote in the 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary against Gov.", "Rick Perry and Sen.

Bill Clinton was the president, John Kasich was the budget chair and Newt Gingrich was the speaker and we created theBalanced Budget Actin 1997.

And you can get past the false crises if you work something out.In light of Kibbes skepticism that bipartisanship can fix the nations budget problems, we thought it was worth examining LaTourettes assertion that Republicans in Congress worked with the Democratic-controlled White House in 1997 to balance the budget, and it was during the Bush years of spending, multiplied by the Obama years that we now have this mess.According to theCongressional Budget Office(CBO), the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was designed to shave $127 billion from the federal budget deficit between 1998 and 2002, largely by slowing the growth of the Medicare program. After that agreement, the federal governments revenue exceeded its spending from1998 to 2001. Throughout that period, Clinton controlled the White House and Republicans controlled the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. President George W. Bush took office in January 2001, after the 2001 budget had been assembled by Clinton and the GOP Congress. As noted by FactCheck.org, the debt the government owes to the public decreased during this period of surpluses, but was not erased.In 2001,CBO predicted the governmentwould run a total of $5.6 trillion in surpluses from 2001-11, including a surplus of nearly $900 billion in 2011 alone. It forecast that the federal governments debt would be erased by 2006, and thered be a $2.3 trillion surplus by 2011. Instead the federal government ran $6.1 trillion in deficits, including deficits exceeding $1 trillion in each of 2009-11. Numerous organizations have analyzed what went wrong.In an April 2011 report, the nonpartisanPew Charitable Trustssaid a variety of factors are responsible for the growth in federal debt since 2001. Its fiscal analysis put two thirds of the blame on legislation adopted since January 2001 that enacted roughly three dollars of new spending for every two dollars in tax cuts. It traced 13 percent of the increased debt to tax cuts that were implemented from 2001 to 2003, 10 percent to spending caused by military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, 6 percent to the Recovery Act, 3 percent to tax legislation adopted in 2010, and 2 percent to establishment of prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries.A different nonprofit, nonpartisan economic research organization callede21says the projected surpluses did not materialize because forecasters made inaccurate projections, such as failing to predict the bursting of the 1990s dot-com stock bubble, which by itself eliminated the surpluses projected for 2002 and 2003. It said that spending increases were responsible for nearly half of the evaporated surplus, that off-base projections caused about 27 percent, and tax relief caused 24 percent.One major factor that worsened the fiscal outlook was a large increase in federal discretionary spending, said the e21 report authored by former Bush administration economic advisorCharles Blahous. Much of this, of course, happened after the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001. The U.S. thereafter conducted major military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and also increased expenditures on homeland security. These policies were enacted with bipartisan support, including bipartisan decisions to add their costs to the federal deficit. Discretionary spending increases further accelerated in 2009-11.It is clear that federal budget surpluses disappeared after 2001 for a variety of reasons. During last years presidential contest, a great deal ofpolitical windwasexpendedover whether Bush or Barack Obama was more to blame for elevated government spending since 2001. Because LaTourette said they both left a mess, its not necessary here to dissect how much harm was done during each presidency.It is worth noting that Bush had a Republican Congress to back his initiatives during most of his presidency. Partway through his first term, Democrats assumed control of the U.S Senate when Vermonts Jim Jeffords left the Republican party and announced hed caucus with Democrats. Republicans controlled all three branches of government from 2003 through 2007. During Bushs last two years, Democrats controlled the House of Representatives and Senate.Obama began his term with his fellow Democrats in charge of the House and Senate. Two years later, Republicans took charge of the House of Representatives, though Democrats retained control of the U.S. Senate. That scenario persists today.LaTourette is correct that the federal budget was balanced in the 1990s, at a time when a Democratic president was forced to find common ground with Republicans who controlled Congress. Hes also correct that the nations budget woes have escalated since then. Spending is no doubt a major factor, but there are a variety of reasons.

Congress didnt take action, tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find child care for their kids.TheNew York Timesreported the next day that day care centers are almost certainly not going to be padlocked on March 1.But what will happen?", "And will it send parents scrambling?Child care subsidies and Head StartAt least two federal programs that affect parents child care options face cuts under the sequester.First, lets recap how the sequester works.", "Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount tentatively7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for nondefense discretionary funding.", "(Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs.", "Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.", ")The uniform cuts must be applied to any program, project or activity that isnt otherwise exempted.", "However, within a given program, officials dont have to cut every line item equally.", "They have discretion to move money around within a program.The two big federal programs affecting child care are theChild Care Development Block Fund, which helps states provide child care subsidies for low-income working parents that affect more than1.6 million kids.", "The second is early education programHead Start, which awards grants to public and private agencies to increase kids school readiness, such as with whole or half-day programs in schools and centers.", "(It also includes programs that wouldnt offset parents child care needs.)", "Head Start says it servesmore than a million kidsa year.All of Head Starts funding is open to sequester, according to the White HousesOffice of Management and Budget.", "About half of the Child Care Development Block Funds programs federal funding is mandatory  and therefore exempt from the sequester  but theother halffaces cuts.Both programs are organized under the Health and Human Services Department, which estimates that up to 70,000 children would lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start programs, with some centers closing their programs early this year or delaying their start in the fall.", "Meanwhile, budget cuts would leave up to 30,000 children without child care services, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote.House Democratsand theWhite Housealso rely on the HHS estimates.But the precise impact and timing of the cuts is difficult to quantify.", "Why?", "Because the programs are designed to give considerable control over spending to states and other public and private agencies.Head Starts rolling grant process means cuts will need to be made over the next seven months, the remainder of the current fiscal year, said Ted Froats, a spokesman for HHS Administration for Children and Families.", "But with the child care grant program, while cuts also take place over seven months, its harder to say when the impact may be felt.", "The department reached its 30,000 estimate by reducing the amount of funding available for the year according to the rules of the sequester and comparing that with the average cost per child served, Froats said.But states have broad flexibility in administering the program, which is also partly funded by the states themselves and by moving money from other federal pots, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.Parents qualify for subsidies on a sliding scale, with some paying co-pays

And will it send parents scrambling?Child care subsidies and Head StartAt least two federal programs that affect parents child care options face cuts under the sequester.First, lets recap how the sequester works. Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount tentatively7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for nondefense discretionary funding. (Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.)The uniform cuts must be applied to any program, project or activity that isnt otherwise exempted. However, within a given program, officials dont have to cut every line item equally. They have discretion to move money around within a program.The two big federal programs affecting child care are theChild Care Development Block Fund, which helps states provide child care subsidies for low-income working parents that affect more than1.6 million kids. The second is early education programHead Start, which awards grants to public and private agencies to increase kids school readiness, such as with whole or half-day programs in schools and centers. (It also includes programs that wouldnt offset parents child care needs.) Head Start says it servesmore than a million kidsa year.All of Head Starts funding is open to sequester, according to the White HousesOffice of Management and Budget. About half of the Child Care Development Block Funds programs federal funding is mandatory  and therefore exempt from the sequester  but theother halffaces cuts.Both programs are organized under the Health and Human Services Department, which estimates that up to 70,000 children would lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start programs, with some centers closing their programs early this year or delaying their start in the fall. Meanwhile, budget cuts would leave up to 30,000 children without child care services, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote.House Democratsand theWhite Housealso rely on the HHS estimates.But the precise impact and timing of the cuts is difficult to quantify. Why? Because the programs are designed to give considerable control over spending to states and other public and private agencies.Head Starts rolling grant process means cuts will need to be made over the next seven months, the remainder of the current fiscal year, said Ted Froats, a spokesman for HHS Administration for Children and Families. But with the child care grant program, while cuts also take place over seven months, its harder to say when the impact may be felt.", "hrefs": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/19/remarks-president-sequester"}, {"sentence": "Still, its important to note that states are already stretched.

However, the state is allowed to borrow money to pay for capital improvement projects, such as university buildings, roads and environmental preservation.There are a few different ways to talk about state debt. Theres the overall total for outstanding debt, which was $26.2 billion as of June 30, 2012.But within that are two categories. The largest chunk ($21.6 billion in 2012) is called net-tax supported debt, which is accrued when the state issues bonds to raise money for spending projects. The smaller part ($4.6 billion in 2012) is self-supporting debt, which is accrued by bonds that come with a revenue source, such as toll roads and dorm construction.This is our second check on Scott and the state debt. In 2011, we rated his claim thatFloridas debt was $23 millionas True, even though he was referring to net tax-supported debt and not total debt. Experts told us then it was okay for him to use that figure.This time, Scott appears to be referring to the total outstanding debt.Whose debt is it anyway?Just as there are different ways to count the debt, there are different ways to assign responsibility for it.We can figure out how much debt Florida accumulated during the Crist years by looking through the archives of the Division of Bond Finance, which publishes an annual report on the debt picture.

That means the first budget he signed -- which included projects in need of bond financing -- covered the 2008 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2008. The last budget Crist signed was for the 2011 fiscal year, which ended six months into Scotts tenure.So, to some experts, its more accurate to assess the growth of the debt under Crist from FY 2008 to FY 2011. This method produces an increase of $3.4 billion in debt, which is still large but not as big as the $5.2 billion that Scott claimed.Scott gets the same treatment. He took office in January 2011, so the first budget he signed covered the budget year running July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2012. Under this measure, Scott reduced the debt only $1.5 billion.All of that said, no one denies the total debt fell sharply with Scott, who is famously debt-averse. Its short of his $2 billion talking point now, but it probably wont be when we get an analysis of debt from the 2012-13 budget, said Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of tax research.Hes only had one year thats been reflected, but certainly I think well find that last year was a relatively low bonding year as well, Wenner said.We should note theres still another way to analyze debt: debt actually issued by a governor.

Over the last year, the average has been about $3.4 billion a day, not $4 billion.Second, thats using a measure of the entire federal debt  including thebig chunk we owe ourselvesthats held by government accounts such as the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.Debt held by the public is the the amount the federal government has actually borrowedto finance deficits. And the amount added to the public debt since Obama took office averages about $3.7 billion a day, not $4 billion.Still, this part of the claim is pretty close.Much of it from ChinaThen theres the part about China. This is where the ads claim gets goofy.If we assume Eastwoods talking about whats been added to the entire federal debt since Obama took office  the amount that averages $4 billion a day  heres how much as of AugustChinaowns: 7.7 percent.If someone told you that there were two pieces to our recent debt, one piece under 8 percent and one piece above 92 percent, then asked you which of those pieces represented much of it, what would you say? Were guessing the non-Chinese piece.Still, China is theNo. 1foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities. (About a thirdof ourtotal debtis held by foreigners.)So the main concern about U.S. public debt held by foreigners is mainly what might happen if they all stopped buying. It could drive up U.S. interest rates, said Wayne Morrison, a specialist in Asian trade and finance for the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.Does that give China some sort of leverage? Or what if they sold off their U.S. securities all at once, sparking some kind of financial crisis?Many economists argue that such a move is highly unlikely, Morrison told PolitiFact.If China tried a big selloff, it would drive up supply of U.S. Treasuries and drive down their value  tanking the value ofChinas own holdings.Our rulingEastwood, speaking in a recent American Crossroads ad, warns that, We borrow $4 billion every single day, much of it from China. That amount is the rough daily average of all U.S. debt added since Obama took office, including the type the government owes itself. Its not the current rate, which has been somewhat lower. And while China is the No. 1 foreign holder of U.S. securities, it purchased less than 10 percent of that debt. This claim is only partly accurate.

If the panel deadlocked, $1 trillion in automatic cuts would be triggered at the start of 2013.Cantor, in a statement released after House vote, gave a qualified endorsement of the debt-limit deal with no specific mention of the sequester.Tonight, the House prevented default and boosted economic certainty by ensuring America pays its bills while we start getting our fiscal house in order, he said. This measure is not perfect or the way we would have done it if we were in charge, but it will finally begin to change the way Washington spends tax dollars.... This is the first significant move -- of many to come -- to turn Washington around.But the partisan debate over whether increased taxes should be part of the debt-reduction plan did not end, and super committee deadlocked. Cantor, during a Nov. 14 news conference, was repeatedly asked if he was bound to allowing the automatic cuts to occur.Im not going to comment, he said. I dont think the sequester will be applicable because I believe they will reach an agreement by the deadline.On Nov. 21, the super committee announced it failed meet its deadline for reaching an agreement, triggering the sequester.This year, on May 10, Cantor and other House Republicans passed a debt reduction plan that held the line on taxes. It offered deep reductions to domestic programs that would replace across-the-board in sequester for a year. The measure died in the Democrat-controlled Senate.During a June 6 news conference, Cantor said were not going to allow tax rates to go up on anyone. He said he and other Republicans were willing to broaden the tax base by eliminating some income tax deductions, although he did not specify which ones.On July 18, Cantor denounced the sequestration. These cuts will harm important  domestic priorities such as education, medical research and law enforcement, he said in a writtenstatement. And perhaps most notably, these cuts threaten our national security and jobs...including (those of) over 100,000 Virginians who make their living in our military, or by ensuring that our men and women in uniform have the very best equipment and support available.On Sept. 11, Cantor told the Fredericksburg Chamber of Commerce that he supported the 2011 debt deal to stave off any other kind of calamity. Of the sequester, he said, It was never intended to be something that went into effect, according to an article in The Free Lance-Star.On Sept. 20, Cantor told Fox News: This president has failed to put a solution on the table that would avoid these defense cuts. The House has taken action to say we dont want these defense cuts, we want to act in a fiscally responsible way and make sure we are beginning to slim down federal spending, but dont do so in a way that disproportionately impacts our defense-related jobs.Our ratingCongress was faced with a stark choice in August 2011: Either agree to a deal that could trigger the sequester or place the nation in default. Cantor chose the deal. As we have written before, it is possible to have voted for the compromise out of a desire to keep Washington solvent and hope that the automatic cuts never occur.We couldnt find any record Cantor saying he supported having the sequester. But the majority leader helped set the clock ticking on the cuts by voting for a measure that included their possibility. And hes maintained a hard line against the compromise Democrats say is necessary to avoid the sequester: mixing in some tax increases with spending cuts to reduce deficits.Cantor is now distancing himself from a situation he helped create.

spending and deficits.Using the same table and a slightly different approach can put a somewhat different spin on the trend line -- though we found no scenario under which the Bush-era deficits top those under Obama.Heres why.The big question any researcher faces is when to start and end the clock when looking at spending and deficit by presidents.It would be tidy to start the clock on

effect in October 2008, during the final months of Bushs second term.That methodology becomes even more important when you consider that just before Bush left office, the deficit for fiscal year 2009 already was projected to be $1.2 trillion, according to the scorekeeping agency for Congress, as reported byPolitiFact.So, Johnson attributes the 2009 deficit entirely to Obama even though much it was already anticipated before the Democrats inauguration.", "(By the end of the 2009 fiscal year, the deficit rose to $1.4 trillion in part due to Obamas economic stimulus plan).What about Johnsons methodology?We asked three experts who closely follow the budget, and each said there is no consensus on how to attribute the overlapping budget years.Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said apportioning responsibility is really tricky.Looking at what has happened -- budget deficit-wise -- during the Bush and the Obama presidencies doesnt tell the whole picture because of the differences of the fiscal year and impacts of policies that were enacted prior to either of them assuming office, Ellis wrote in an email.Still, Ellis said he considered Johnsons numbers correct even if the presentation was simplistic.Whats more, there are some extra complicating factors unique to the Bush-Obama changeover, such as how best to parcel out the deficit blame for such things as Bushs major tax cuts and Obamas more modest tax trims, two wars that overlap their presidencies, two recessions, a Wall Street bailout that each supported, and major new programs under each (Medicare prescription drugs, stimulus).The Great Recession of 2007-2009, which fueled deficits when tax collections fell, also overlapped the two presidencies.Jason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Johnsons numbers were defensible.", "He suggested looking at theincrease in debt-- as opposed to deficits -- because it can be tracked to the day a president starts and ends a term.By that measure, we found a $4.9 trillion increase in gross public debt in Bushs two terms vs. $5.4 trillion so far in Obamas single term.Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said there is no good answer to your question that is going to satisfy everyone.Our ratingJohnsons chart showed $2 trillion in deficits under Bush and $5.3

slowdown.Explaining one of hisdigital chartsduring a Sept. 11, 2012 campaign stop in Sheboygan, Johnson ripped Obama forsayinghis administrations proposedBuffett ruletax plan for million-dollar earners would stabilize our debt and deficits for the next decade.I havent yet publicly called President Obama a liar, Johnsontold his audience. But Im saying he lies. Slight diplomatic difference.Johnson said the Buffett rule would raise just $5 billion a year. Hes right, as PolitiFact Ohio found in ratingTruea claim by Sen. Rob Portman that it would bring in less than $5 billion per year. ... Enough to pay one weeks interest on the national debt.Johnsons presentation uses a chart to contrast the Buffett Rules revenue potential to the deficits accumulated under Obama (2009-2012) and over the two terms of his predecessor, Republican George W. Bush (2001-2008).The chart shows deficits totalling $2 trillion in eight years under Bush, and $5.3 trillion under Obama in just four years. A caption on the chart says those deficits exploded during the Obama administration.Is Johnson right on the deficit numbers and their rapid growth?As backup, Johnsons campaign cited numbers from the White HousesOffice of Management and Budget.The figures show red-ink budgets in seven of eight years that coincide with Bushs term. The annual deficits totalled $820 billion in his first term and nearly $1.2 trillion in his second.Add them up and theres the $2 trillion figure cited by Johnson.That same White House table shows four years of deficits for 2009-12, the time frame that coincides with the Obama era, ranging from $1.29 trillion to $1.4 trillion. The total, including estimated figures for 2012, is $5.33 trillion.Thats nearly triple the Bush deficit figure, in half the time.It seems simple, with the numbers and the trend matching up with Perots, er, Johnsons chart.We wish it were that simple.But there is considerable disagreement in academic and political circles over how to assign responsibility to presidents for spending and deficits.Using the same table and a slightly different approach can put a somewhat different spin on the trend line -- though we found no scenario under which the Bush-era deficits top those under Obama.Heres why.The big question any researcher faces is when to start and end the clock when looking at spending and deficit by presidents.It would be tidy to start the clock on Inauguration Day, but the federal budget year begins Oct. 1. That means an incoming president inherits a budget-in-progress from his predecessor, though he often makes changes.That timing mismatch makes a pretty big difference, for example, in pinning deficit numbers on Bush and Obama.To wit: Democrat Bill Clintons last budget, for fiscal 2001, resulted in a surplus of $128 billion -- the last black-ink budget on record. But Johnson attributed that surplus to Bush, who entered office Jan. 20, 2001. Johnson argues that once elected the budget can be changed by the new president.Similarly, on the back end of the Bush years, Johnson gives the eye-popping 2009 deficit of     $1.4 trillion all to Obama -- even though Obama was working with Bushs last budget, which took effect in October 2008, during the final months of Bushs second term.That methodology becomes even more important when you consider that just before Bush left office, the deficit for fiscal year 2009 already was projected to be $1.2 trillion, according to the scorekeeping agency for Congress, as reported byPolitiFact.So, Johnson attributes the 2009 deficit entirely to Obama even though much it was already anticipated before the Democrats inauguration. (By the end of the 2009 fiscal year, the deficit rose to $1.4 trillion in part due to Obamas economic stimulus plan).What about Johnsons methodology?We asked three experts who closely follow the budget, and each said there is no consensus on how to attribute the overlapping budget years.Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said apportioning responsibility is really tricky.Looking at what has happened -- budget deficit-wise -- during the Bush and the Obama presidencies doesnt tell the whole picture because of the differences of the fiscal year and impacts of policies that were enacted prior to either of them assuming office, Ellis wrote in an email.Still, Ellis said he considered Johnsons numbers correct even if the presentation was simplistic.Whats more, there are some extra complicating factors unique to the Bush-Obama changeover, such as how best to parcel out the deficit blame for such things as Bushs major tax cuts and Obamas more modest tax trims, two wars that overlap their presidencies, two recessions, a Wall Street bailout that each supported, and major new programs under each (Medicare prescription drugs, stimulus).The Great Recession of 2007-2009, which fueled deficits when tax collections fell, also overlapped the two presidencies.Jason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Johnsons numbers were defensible. He suggested looking at theincrease in debt-- as opposed to deficits -- because it can be tracked to the day a president starts and ends a term.By that measure, we found a $4.9 trillion increase in gross public debt in Bushs two terms vs. $5.4 trillion so far in Obamas single term.Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said there is no good answer to your question that is going to satisfy everyone.Our ratingJohnsons chart showed $2 trillion in deficits under Bush and $5.3 trillion under Obama, and concluded that deficits exploded during the Obama administration.The numbers check out, but comparing presidents budget records is not as simple as Johnsons chart suggests.

CBO is an independent congressional agency, but the Treasury Department is part of the Obama administration, so we need to look closely to see whether Treasury is interpreting CBOs data fairly and accurately.To figure out what caused the accumulation of deficits over the past decade, CBO tracked the surplus it had projected back in 2001 and compared it to the actual cumulative deficits that resulted instead.

Well use three years -- 2009, 2010, and 2011 -- because those are the years that reflect Obamas presidency. (Data for 2012 isnt available yet.)Over this period, 38 percent of the swing comes from spending, 20 percent from tax cuts, 14 percent from interest increases and 28 percent from faulty CBO projections. Using Obamas strict definition of what laws count as Bushs and Obamas, about 17 percent of this swing is attributable to Obama, not 10 percent.What should count as Bushs and Obamas?The bigger problem with Obamas figure, though, is in what he blames on Bush.Obama in the interview mentioned the big-ticket Bush programs -- the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Medicare prescription drug program. The total by his Treasury department also includes other laws, such as the 2008 Bush stimulus package, which Obama supported as a senator. Meanwhile, Obama claims as his own the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the stimulus), TARP and the tax act of 2010.However, this division seems unduly generous toward Obama because it includes policies he supports, or has supported. Obama has said he intends to keep the Bush tax cuts for Americans earning under $200,000, which accounts for a significant chunk of the cost. If he supports the policy, he shouldnt be able to fob off 100 percent of the responsibility on his predecessor.The same goes for the Medicare drug program -- a program Obama not only supports but actually expanded in his health care bill.

It typically comes out in late December.Cicilline spokesman Eric Hyers said Doherty falsely assumed that Cicilline knew about the auditor's deadlines and that the mayor instructed his staff to miss the deadlines. Neither of those things happened.Doherty campaign spokesman Robert Coupe acknowledged that there was no smoking gun showing that Cicilline or his staff ordered a delay in the release of financial data. But the delay, he said, was part of a pattern that kept the public in the dark about the city's finances.There was a consistent pattern of withholding key financial information, not only from the external auditor, but also from the internal auditor, the City Council and the Rhode Island Division of Municipal Finance, he said.That shows intent, Coupe argued. This was not an accident but was a component of the overall pattern and therefore intentional.Our rulingBrendan Doherty said David Cicilline, when he was mayor of Providence, was required to provide key information about city finances to an independent outside auditor. The deadlines were clear -- yet [he intentionally] missed them by months until after the November 2010 election.A subsequent report by the city on what led to its financial problems, along with a supporting e-mail from the firm that did the outside audit, support the claim that many deadlines for the outside audit were not met by the Cicilline administration.However, Doherty declared that Cicilline intentionally withheld the information until after the election, suggesting that the delay was designed to help him get elected to Congress.We previously gave Cicilline aMostly Falseon his statement that theinternalauditor for the city of Providence was not locked out of access to the city's finances. We found evidence of serious delays but ultimately, in that case, that auditor (Clarkin's predecessor) received the long-sought informationbeforethe November election.But in this instance, involving the outside audit, we've seen no real evidence -- and Doherty provided none -- that the delays were part of an attempt by Cicilline to hide bad news from voters.The facts argue otherwise.The external auditor himself judged the delays to be caused by a finance department in disarray.And even if every deadline had been met, the results of the audit would not have been released before the November election. Such audits are due at the end of the year, nearly two months after the votes are counted, a timetable noted in the very document the Doherty campaign cites.In the end, we have the former head of the Rhode Island State Police making allegations without key evidence, and ignoring evidence that points in another direction.Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate itMostly False.(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter:@politifactri.

Pawlentys figure referred to the public debt, which stood at $9.4 trillion at the time.

PolitiFact ruled the claimTrueusing the total debt figure.Most people use public debt, but total debt is a good measure too, said Ron Haskins, co-director of the Brookings Institutions Budgeting for National Priorities Project. What difference does it make if debt is owed to the public or to another part of the government?

That report, dated January 2011, confirmed the financial problems.)In the fall of 2010, when Cicilline was winding down his tenure as mayor and in the middle of a tough race for the U.S. House, Lombardi was complaining that Providence's finances were in trouble and he was having trouble getting access to information.We found some justification for Gemma's assertion that Lombardi was locked out.Two Providence Journal stories by two different reporters in March 2011 reported that Lombardi said the administration had canceled his computer access when he began to ask questions about the city's finances, forcing him to seek information by filing formal requests under the Rhode Island Access to Public Records Act.Lombardi now says that he was never locked out of his computer. His computer access to city financial records was never canceled, he said,  because he never had such access in the first place.Nor was he ever physically locked out of his office or anywhere else where he tried to get records.That would mean Cicilline is correct in the strictest sense of the phrase locked out.But you can still be figuratively locked out if you are denied access to something you're legally entitled to.Providence's City Charter requires the City Council to appoint an internal auditor who shall have access to the books and records of all offices, department and other agencies of the city. That section of the charter offers no limitation. The auditor reports to the council, not the mayor.Lombardi, whose complaints about his inability to get information from the mayor's office go back to 2004, told us that in this case the problem wasn't that he was denied the information. The problem was the timeliness of the responses he was getting.A key issue was whether the city's reserve fund -- sometimes called the rainy-day fund -- was being severely depleted. City records show that on Jan. 11, 2010, Lombardi had requested copies of all authorization forms transferring money in and out of the reserve fund in January 2010, which the Cicilline administration was tapping because of its budget problems.Three days later, he wrote to the city solicitor's office asking it to assist with the request because, if that request was treated like other requests he had made in the past, I will never see it.Lombardi said if that couldn't be done, he would request the data under the state open records law, adding that he thought it was ridiculous that he would have to do such a thing.He did not get the information until October 2010, according to a report he filed with the City Council. That's nine months.When we asked the Cicilline campaign about the delay, spokesman Eric Hyers said there was absolutely not any plan to delay him, to do anything secretly or to stonewall him.Hyers said Lombardi had access to whatever he needed. He oftentimes had very unrealistic expectations as to what the turnaround time should be and how soon he should be provided with certain information. At times he assumed that City Hall officials were his own personal staff; they had their own jobs to do.Hyers said this constant tug of war over what he was entitled to and when he should have it was not unique to 2010. It started several, several years ago.We saw two other examples.In May, according to city records, Lombardi requested a cash flow analysis and was told by the Cicilline administration that (a.) one didn't exist and (b.) the administration was not obligated to generate one just for him under the open records law.Also in May, he asked Bruce Miller, the city's finance director, for a schedule detailing how the Cicilline administration planned to balance the city's budget. He was told that, until the plan was finalized, he wasn't entitled to see it under the open records law.Lombardi said he ultimately received the information he wanted in October 2010. That was after the Democratic primary, where Gemma was one of Cicillines opponents, and before the general election, where Cicilline ran against Republican John Loughlin.Loughlin was able to use that information in a Channel 12 debate, during which Cicilline, while touting his accomplishments as mayor, made the now-infamous declaration that Providence was in excellent financial condition.That record would become seriously tarnished after the election when an independent audit made the full extent of Providence's financial problems painfully clear.Our rulingFormer Providence Mayor David Cicilline said that the internal auditor for the city was not locked out of access to the city's finances.The auditor now says that he was not locked out in the usual sense of the word.But there's a fine line between being locked out and stonewalled.Cicilline's spokesman emphatically says that neither of those happened.But the record shows that Lombardi faced many months of delay in getting information he was entitled to by the City Charter. He was forced to use the states open records law to get information and waited months for it.And key information -- that Cicilline had been tapping the rainy day fund -- wasnt provided until October 2010, after Cicillines primary victory.Whether it was part of a long-running political wrangle between the mayor and the City Council, which hires the internal auditor, is irrelevant. Open record laws require the release of information regardless of the motives of the person seeking it.The auditor was not locked out in the strictest sense. But the inability of the internal auditor to get information that might have led to a timely disclosure of the city's serious financial problems had the same effect.Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate itMostly False.(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter:@politifactri.

The agreement comes before a Sept. 18 election on a county ballot measure, which, if approved, would require voter approval before officials can spend money on light rail.Instead of singling out a commissioner, we will focus on the statement put out by the county since it sums up nicely the numbers on which the three-member majority wants to focus: $19.9 million versus $25 million.The new agreement withTriMet does slice $2.4 million from the $25 million. But that leaves a balance of $22.6 million, not $19.9 million.

Subtracting those contributions leaves a cash balance of $19,934,038 the county owes TriMet. In other words, $19.9 million. (The county issetto sell $19.1 million in bonds Sept. 6, toward the balance due.)The Oregonians Clackamas County reporter has consistently characterized the cost of the new agreement with TriMet as $22.6 million, even if the new amount that requires financing is lower.  We think thats more accurate, despite politicians inclinations to inflate. So does Dan Chandler, strategic policy administrator and the countys point man on the subject.The reduction in borrowing is $5 million, but the actual savings are less than that, Chandler said.The original agreement signed in February 2010 called for Clackamas County to pay TriMet $25 million toward the cost of the $1.5 billion project. Section 4.1 of the contract states the county could meet that amount by lump-sum payment or payments or in-kind contributions, or any combination.Lets return to the statement: Did the commission approve a new deal that lowers the countys contribution to $19.9 million, down from $25 million? It did not.The countys financial contribution to TriMet for the new Orange line is now $22.6 million, much of which will be financed by borrowing. The in-kind contributions come from money the county will now forgo or must spend to meet its obligations.

Investment advisers and active investors buy its shares as a hedge against changes in interest rates, a gamble referred to in columns and blogs that cover high-stakes finance. ProShares recommends in its marketing and disclosure materials that investors watch this fund daily, as it is subject to volatility. It is not a casual buy-and-hold investment.Ilana Mandel is not a professional investor. According to Josh Mandels financial disclosure and his campaign spokeswoman, Nicole Sizemore, the ETF and other investments are owned through the JMS Trust. When those trust assets are put together with her husbands far more meager holdings, the couples worth runs in a rangebetween $1.95 million and $7.1 million, according to financial disclosure filings. Ilana Mandel inherited the money; her grandmother was a founder of Forest City Enterprises, the real estate and development company.Neither Josh nor his wife have control over Ilana's family's trust so neither of them are making any investment activity decisions on it, Sizemore said. These decisions are made by the investment manager and presumably the trustees who oversee her family's trust.Josh Mandel has steadfastly refused to discuss his wifes holdings, other than to report what is required by disclosure rules for public officials and candidates. His campaign said it was unable to discern why the investment manager or trustees bought this particular ETF but reiterated that neither Josh nor Ilana Mandel had a role in it.As noted in a number of financial blogs and columns, other investors buy shares in this ETF as a hedge against rising interest rates. Not being investment professionals, however, PolitiFact Ohio turned to Jack Bao, an assistant professor of finance at Ohio State University and an authority on bonds.I guess that if the government did default, the short ETF would rise in value, Bao said when we told him of the Workers Voice scenario. But that is extremely unlikely, he said, adding that other options might have been possible to avoid default, such as printing more money, even if Congress had not raised the debt ceiling.To believe that somebody was buying $15,000 worth of a short ETF and betting on the government defaulting seems a little far-fetched to me, Bao said. What happens in most cases, he said, is the investor buys this ETF as a bet on interest rates. He or she thinks theyll go up and the value of Treasuries will go down -- but not necessarily tank.Before we rule on the Workers Voice claim, its important to point out that Mandel never said he wanted the government to default. Like a number of other Republicans, he said that government spending needed to come down before Congress raised the debt ceiling. By playing this game of chicken, some Republicans said they hoped to force a more frugal solution that fell short of default. Democrats cobbled together a big enough coalition to raise the debt limit anyway. Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman joined them. The storm blew over.That leaves us with an extreme claim -- that Mandel was betting against Ohio families and hoping to fatten his family wallet. While we cannot say why his wifes trust chose that particular ETF, we know that investors have plenty of rationales besides betting on default. In fact, Bao, the OSU professor, disclosed that he too invested in a short Treasury ETF. We realized that he and Ilana Mandels investment adviser had chosen, in fact, the very same ProShares ETF.So an OSU finance professor was betting on default, too? I wasnt betting on the government defaulting, Boa said. I was betting on interest rates going up.In all the worlds possibilities, default was one. In probabilities, it was not. As we noted, the JMS Trust appeared to buy additional shares of this ETF subsequent to last Augusts debt-ceiling showdown. Thats an additional factor that makes the ads claim -- that Mandel was betting against Ohio families -- far-fetched. The claim relies on one extreme possibility -- a possibility that has never occurred -- and runs with it, ignoring the other reasons why a trust fund or even a finance professor might choose this investment. Thats just ridiculous.

portrayed himself  as a budget-cutter extraordinaire during his four years in Congress, but one of his rivals is painting him as a piggish paragon of waste.In Congress Mark Neumann voted for over 2,000 earmarks, including the Bridge To Nowhere, aTV adby fellow Republican Eric Hovde charges. Congressman Neumann voted four times to increase our debt.Neumann did vote in 1998 for a massive transportation bill that included many earmarks, including that infamous Alaska bridge project,wereportedin an item during Neumanns failed 2010 bid for the Republican nomination for governor.But what about the claim of voting to raise the nations debt ceiling?Thedebtceilingis the legal cap on borrowing by the federal government. Raising it isroutinelydoneunder presidents ofboth parties, but periodically that move stalls, as in the summer of 2011 when a stalemate pushed the nation to the edge of default.Neumanns record on the issue takes us back to 1995 when he entered Congress as a member of the GOP freshman class that ushered in the Republican Revolution under new House Speaker Newt Gingrich.Voting records show Neumann had four chances to vote for or against extending the debt ceiling.In all four instances, he voted to increase the limit, according to the online database maintained by theLibrary of Congress:--October 26, 1995: Neumann helped squeak through an attempt toboost the debt limit, in a broader bill, on a 227-203 vote largely along party lines. President Bill Clinton vetoed the bill.--November 9, 1995: Neumann, along with nearly every House Republican, voted to temporarilypush the public debtlimitto $4.967 trillion. Clinton vetoed this as well.--March 7, 1996: Congress again sent Clinton a broad fiscal bill that included an increase in the debt limit to $5.5 trillion. The vote was bipartisan, with 127 Democrats joining the majority on a 328-91 vote. Thirty Republicans dissented, but Neumann joined the majority. Clinton signed it.--July 30, 1997: Neumann again voted with most Republicans and 52 Democrats to boost the limit to $5.95 trillion, again as part of a broader bill. The tally was 346-85, with 32 Republicans voting no. The president signed it.Like so many of the claims in the four-way GOP primary, Hovdes ad takes a snippet of information that is accurate, but strips it of important context.The thrust of the ad is that the votes show Neumann to be pro-spending and government growth. In the 2012 campaign Neumann is running on a platform to balance the budget on afive-year plan.A look at the votes shows they came as Neumann and other conservatives pushed the Democratic president for significant spending cuts. Compromise talks failed, leading, famously, to two temporary government shutdowns.The 1995 votes were part of the legislative battle over the GOPs balanced budget act, which aimed to accomplish a balanced budget in seven years.In fact, in three of the four votes Hovde cites, the debt-limit increase was part of very broad fiscal measures.The March 1996 debt action, for example, was tucked into a multifaceted bill to reduce federal regulation of business, and as we noted it drew significant Democratic support.Finally, the August 1997 increase in the debt limit was approved as part of an act theNew York Timesdescribedas sweeping legislation intended to balance the federal budget for the first time since 1969.The government actually ran asurplus from 1998 to 2001, thanks to what observers said was a combination of an earlier tax increase, spending restraints, economic growth and stock market gains.Foreshadowing the 2011 showdown, Neumann, an earlycrusader on the perils of debt, was trying to leverage the deadline over raising the debt ceiling to get deeper spending cuts.That sounds a lot like Hovdes position, which he laid out at acandidate forum in April2012.He said he could support a debt-ceiling increase but only if its tied to strict spending restraints that balance the budget within two years.Our ratingIn a TV ad, Hovde paints Neumann as a go-along-to-get-along congressman who was cavalier about federal spending and helped raise the nations debt.Neumann did vote four times to extend the debt ceiling, but the ad leaves out important details: The votes were part of a historic drive by Republicans to balance the budget, and were wrapped into huge fiscal bills.That pushes his claim down to Half True on the Truth-O-Meter.", "hrefs": "https:///www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgVTApqCmyU&feature=player_embedded"}], "label": "half-true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/aug/02/sandy-adams/sandy-adams-says-john-mica-voted-10-trillion-debt/", "title": "John Mica voted to borrow $10 trillion.", "author": "Katie Sanders", "posted": "08/02/2012", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["The federal debt is at the center of a bruising interparty war between Republican Reps.

The tax cuts that have lowered revenue and increased deficits over the last three years have had bipartisan support, as have nearly every spending bill over the last two years.So, it is impossible to attribute the debt to any single politician or party, Gordon told PolitiFact. Furthermore, the increase in debt tells you nothing about what legislative proposals by the candidates would do in the future -- and it is the future debt growth that matters most.Burtless said that most of the debt added under Obama would have happened even if he followed the tax and spending policies in effect when he took office. But Obama embraced policies that increased the public debt -- including signing the stimulus package and agreeing to other measures that held down taxes and increased unemployment benefits.However, I believe the overwhelming share of extra public debt accumulated since Jan. 2009 would also have been accumulated even if none of those new policies had been proposed or adopted, Burtless said. The reason is straightforward. The Bush administration was committed to a certain level of spending (for defense, non-defense discretionary, and mandatory non-defense programs) and to a particular schedule of income and payroll taxes. Those policies, if maintained by President Obama, would have produced sizeable annual deficits  deficits nearly as large as the ones we actually saw.But Obama is not off the hook here.Was not deficit spending the core feature of his economic stimulus plan? Has he objected to it in any way? Has he proposed changes in fiscal policy that would have materially altered the course? Each answer is obvious, and each leads to the same conclusion -- it is perfectly fair to argue that Obama is responsible for this debt increase, Foster told PolitiFact. Did he sign every bill that produced the debt? Of course not.

The debt hasnt even doubled over the roughly three and a half years since the president took office.The chain e-mail includes various other statements about Obamas time in the White House, from his use of a teleprompter to the gift he gave to the Queen of England. Check out thisstoryfrom FactCheck.org about all of the claims made in the e-mail.Now, lets explain how the national debt has increased under Obama.There are two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt.The debt held by the public refers to money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare.On Jan. 20, 2009, the date of Obama's inauguration, debt held by the public was about $6.3 trillion and total debt stood at roughly $10.6 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Debt to the Penny calculator.A year later, debt held by the public was about $7.8 trillion and total debt was about $12.3 trillion. Those figures represent over-the-year increases of about 24 percent and 16 percent in the respective categories.Both forms of debt continued to increase in the two subsequent years, but at a declining pace.Between Jan. 20, 2010 and Jan. 20, 2011, debt held by the public grew by about 20.5 percent and total debt increased by roughly 14 percent.From Jan. 20, 2011 to Jan. 20, 2012, debt held by the public went up by around 11.3 percent, while total debt increased by about 8.4 percent.When PolitiFact New Jersey received the chain e-mail on July 10, debt held by the public stood at about $11 trillion and total debt was about $15.9 trillion. Compared to Obamas inauguration, thats an increase of roughly 75.6 percent and 49.5 percent, respectively.So, starting with the inauguration, the largest over-the-year increase in either form of national debt was about 24 percent. Over the course of roughly three and a half years, both forms of debt have risen sharply, but still havent doubled.The factors behind debt increases over the last decade include legislation approved by Obama, such as the stimulus bill signed in February 2009 and tax cuts enacted in December 2010, according to a study released in April 2011 by the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative.But other contributing factors were initiated under President George W. Bush, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the analysis shows. Experts also have told us the weak economy has contributed to the higher debt.Our rulingA chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey claims Obama doubled the national debt, which had taken more than two centuries to accumulate, in one year.Theres no doubt that the national debt has increased significantly since Obama took office, but its outrageous to claim it doubled in one year.Starting with his inauguration, the largest over-the-year increase in either form of national debt was about 24 percent. Even after roughly three and-a-half years into his presidency, both forms of debt still have not doubled.Were just left with three words to describe this claim: Pants on Fire!", "hrefs": "https://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/04/chain-email/obama-has-added-more-national-debt-previous-43-pre/"}, {"sentence": "To comment on this ruling, go toNJ.com.", "hrefs": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/07/politifact_nj_obama_doubled_th.html"}], "label": "false"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/jul/19/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-national-debt-doubled-under-georg/", "title": "Says federal debt doubled during the Bush administration.", "author": "Sue Owen", "posted": "07/19/2012", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["Former Texas state Rep.
