treasurer, told us he drew the count of 27-plus lost miles of traffic lanes from research by Roger Falk of the Travis County Taxpayers Association that focused on major city byways that would be affected by $482 million in the bond intended to reconfigure parts of nine smart corridors.", "The smart corridors: North Lamar Boulevard from U.S. 183 to Howard Lane; South Lamar from Riverside Drive

happen right off.", "According to an Oct. 23, 2016,StatesmanQ&A,city studiesarent even complete for two of the corridors and the $482 million would cover only a quarter to a third of the corridor projects total estimated $1.56 billion-plus price tag.", "Another aspect: At least 14 travel lane miles would be funded by $101 million of the proposed bond spending limited to local street improvements, according to an Oct. 1, 2016,Statesmannews story.", "Projects in this category, the story said, include three miles on Parmer Lane and congested roads in west and northwest Austin.", "PACs backup To our inquiry, Falk emailed a document showing what he said he calculated based oncity-posted smart corridor studies.", "All told,Falks documentindicates that one to two lanes on portions of seven major roads would no longer be available to car traffic, for a total 32.1 vehicle lane miles removed.", "Some 4.4 lane miles would be returned in spots, the document says, leaving a net loss of 27.7 lane miles.", "The document doesnt talk about removed lanes becoming bus or bike lanes nor does it take note of the car travel lanes that would be added outside the smart corridors, which wasn't considered in the PAC's count of lost lanes, Levy acknowledged by phone.", "City and newspaper analyses After we shared Falks document with city officials, mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford said by phone the citys corridor plans actually show only 4.4 lane-miles of traffic lanes that would definitely give way to bus lanes--specifically, a lane in each direction on a 1.2-mile stretch of Guadalupe near the University of Texas and a lane in each direction on a one-mile portion of East Riverside Drive.", "Meantime, Jim Wick ofMove Austin Forward, a pro-proposition group, called to say Stanford had told him about our inquiry into the lanes-lost claim.", "By email,Wick saidthat by his calculation, city plans to replace two-way center turn (or chicken) lanes along parts of multiple corridors would lead to 14.8 lane miles getting replaced with raised medians.", "Wick said that another nine miles of the two-way center turn lanes on corridors have either already been taken up by medians or stand to be converted, under city plans, to left-turn turning bays.", "Stanford and Wick each said city plans dont call for any traffic lanes to be replaced by bikeways.", "Separately, Falk said by email he wasnt aware of any lane removals specifically planned to make space for bike paths.", "On the other hand, the Oct. 1, 2016,Statesmanstory mentioned travel lanes potentially becoming bikeways under the city plans, the rationale being that bond-connected losses of travel lanes in each direction on a stretch of East Riverside Drive would partly be explained by

years, property values have started to rise again, so that the same tax rate now generates more revenue for the city  $123.5 million last year and an expected $132.2 million this year.", "Buckhorn said theres been no tax increase because he did not raise the property tax rate.", "And he said at the existing tax rate it will take years for the citys property tax revenues to climb back to where they were.", "When people think of taxes, he said, the tax rate is largely what they think about.", "That's what they react to.", "But the relationship between tax rates, the value of property and the amount of tax the two generate together has been the focus of Floridas Truth in Millage (TRIM) law since it was passed in 1980.", "The TRIM law requires local governments to tell taxpayers what property tax rate would generate the same revenues for the coming year as in the current year.", "If property values  not including things like new construction and building additions  have risen, then the calculation determines how much officials would have to roll back the tax rate to generate the same level of revenue.", "If they propose a higher rate  including by keeping the rate they already have  then the law requires them to advertise a tax increase.", "Thats what the city of Tampa has done the last two years.", "For the city of Tampa's 2013-14 fiscal year, the adopted rate was 4.4 percent higher than the rollback rate.", "For the 2014-15 fiscal year, the adopted rate was about 5.2 percent higher than the rollback rate.", "Buckhorn said the additional revenue generated by keeping the same property tax rate instead of lowering it to the rollback rate does not count as raising taxes.", "That is a function of the value of the property, Buckhorn said.", "It's not a function of the baseline tax (rate) that the city assesses.", "If I had raised the property tax rate, then I couldn't have made that statement.", "There's a difference between somebody paying more because the value of their house increases versus the city assessing a higher rate to generate more revenue.", "That line of thinking, however, was what legislators were trying to push back when they wrote the Truth in Millage law in 1980.", "This attempt by local officials to blame rising property taxes on increasing assessments and thereby share the responsibility for tax hikes with the property appraisers is precisely the problem the TRIM disclosure provisions seek to resolve,  according to aFlorida State University Law Reviewarticle co-authored by then-House Finance and Taxation Committee chairman Steve Pajcic the year the law was passed.", "Before then, many taxpayers had focused on appealing their assessments, but with the TRIM law the Legislature was trying to alert taxpayers to the importance of the millage rate and to encourage them to view it as the factor over which they have the most control, Pajcic and his co-authors wrote.", "It is an incorrect statement to say that you havent increased taxes if you dont go back to the roll-back rate, because you have, Benjamin Phipps, a Tallahassee attorney and expert on property taxation who served as counsel to the Florida House of Representatives Tax Committee and the speaker of the House in the 1970s, told PolitiFact Florida on Jan. 14, 2015.", "Buckhorns TV ad says he balanced the budget without raising taxes.", "Because the city kept its property tax rate constant even as the total value of property in the city rose, the city has seen its property tax revenues rise the past two fiscal years.", "And it has been required by state law to advertise a tax increase for both of those years.", "Tax revenues are still significantly below what they were before the real estate crash.", "We rate this statement Mostly

consideration of the county attorney's legitimate effort to enforce the Open Meetings Act and Mike Martinez's efforts to ensure that even the potential for appearance of impropriety is avoided by implementing best practices related to and open government, it said.", "Escamilla elaborated to us that if a member had refused to sign the plea bargain agreement, he or she would have been charged with violating a provision in the states government code barring a member or group of members of a governmental body from knowingly conspiring to circumvent the open meetings law by meeting in numbers less than a quorum for the purpose of secret deliberations.", "The PACs statement is accurate with respect to the fact that Mr. Martinez entered into an agreement deferring prosecution on the

needed to be improved because so many people were drawn to the aquarium, the costs could be paid for out of the resurfacing fund, any available tax increment revenue, or a variety of other funds, including reserves, the Penny for Pinellas sales tax or the general fund.", "But the city hasnt discussed options yet, Wilson said.No one, including referendum opponents, has a crystal ball to predict what the city will spend in future years for neighborhood projects or for downtown improvements.But since the aquarium plan is to seek only half of the increment revenue, and only for 20 years, the remaining half of that revenue would theoretically remain available for projects benefitting the downtown neighborhood.And use of those dollars downtown wouldnt hurt other neighborhoods in the city,

Sportsrebutted Lorias claims about everything from player trades to finances to the stadiumsdesign awards.)Here at PolitiFact, we decided to put part of Lorias claims about the stadiums public financing to the Truth-O-Meter:The majority of public funding came from hotel taxes, the burden of which is incurred by tourists who are visiting our city, NOT the resident taxpayers.Lorias claim suggests that it was largely tourists -- not Miami-Dade taxpayers -- who are footing the bill for a stadium project. Is it those high-rolling tourists who are mostly paying by plunking down credit cards at luxurious hotels in South Beach and beyond? Do resident taxpayers bear minimal financial burden here for the stadium?Marlins stadium dealWe turned toMiami Heraldarticles, stadium agreement documents and county officials to explain the deal.After about a decade of failed attempts, the Marlins finally reached a deal in 2009 with Miami-Dade County and the city of Miami to replace the Orange Bowl stadium with a 37,000-seat retractable roof stadium in the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami.The stadium cost about $515 million.

But some bed tax dollars can be used for non-sports projects, such asmuseums and theaters.The stadium was built on city-owned land later deeded over to the county, so the Marlins dont have to pay property taxes.City of Miami:In March 2009, the city of Miami pledged $94 million for the city-owned, 5,800-spot parking structures (the final cost later dropped). The city also committed $13 million from bed taxes toward stadium construction, and $12 million for other improvements.Marlins:The team agreed to pay about $120 million toward stadium construction, and borrowed an additional $35 million from the county. The team pays rent, starting at about $2.3 million a year, plus 2 percent a year, to pay back that loan. The team is also paying $6 million of the countys construction costs. The Marlins pays the city about $10 per parking space.If all this werent complicated enough, in 2011, theMiami Heraldreported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission -- which was already reviewing the city of Miamis finances -- had launched a separate probe of the stadium deal, to see if the city misled investors about the parking complex bonds.Experts say that Loria is omitting some key pointsWe interviewed a few stadium financing experts who said that while Loria was correct that hotel bed taxes paid for a huge chunk of the cost, his claim obscured the fact that it was still public money, and it could have been spent on other projects to benefit local taxpayers.Simply put, Miami is going to get bed tax revenue regardless of whether Marlins park was built.

Hasners campaign notes that when Frankel broke a tie to fill a commissionvacancyin 2006 she chose a City Center supporter.The bathroom controversy started withmediacoverageabout the new city hall from thenPalm Beach Postgossip columnist Jose Lambiet. (He now has his own website and writes a column for theMiami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida partner.)Yes, marble, as in most Palm Beach mansions. In the middle of a recession, Lambiet wrote in 2009. Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer!The column quoted Frankel:In the big scheme of things, it was probably a minuscule cost, Frankel said. I didn't ask for it. The designer did. I don't even know if I'll ever use the shower. But this building was constructed to last 100 years, and it's not been built for me. It's been built for mayors after me.Lambiet wrote several weeks later that a statement by the builder, Dan Catalfumo, showed that the bathroom/shower in Frankels office cost $13,323.The cost for plumbing the entire city hall was $1.6 million and the value of stone and tiles was $1.2 million, Lambiet wrote.For privacy, security, and job efficiency reasons, the designers included a private bath within the mayor's office, Frankel spokesman Chase Scott said at the time. It is a small, commercial grade facility, and its cost was in the same range as the other bathrooms in city hall.Scott no longer works for the city, but when PolitiFact Florida contacted him, he said Frankel did not request the marble.Lois Frankel did not design or have any input into the materials used, as they were all selected by the architect. I know this because at the time City Center was completed we gave tours, and I needed all the design information,  Scott told us in an email.Scott said he had requested the bathroom be part of the mayors office because mayors work into the evening, are often outdoors in the heat, and have to hold press conferences, I believed it was a good idea for all future mayors to have the ability to freshen up, as their office is often their real home.Did the shower cost $13,000?Hasner's ad states that the shower alone cost $13,000, but we couldnt find any documents to support that claim.Lambiet said he no longer had that builders statement from 2009, and we could not reach Catalfumo. (He now has muchbiggerproblems.)Frankels campaign sent us to two sources -- project architect Young Song and project executive J.J.  Wolfe who worked with Catalfumo.We never designed a marble shower, said architect Young Song. According to the plans, the mayors bathroom was supposed to be tile.Wolfe said he used marble that was left over from another job, so it didnt add to the project tab.We thought we are doing something nice, and it turned into big fiasco. The marble was free, so it seemed like a reasonable thing to do at time, Wolfe said. If I could take back, I would put in the  ugliest pink polka-dotted tile in there I could come up with.Wolfe said $13,000 for the shower was an inflated figure that didnt reflect the actual costs. It was based on an average for the bathroom that the builder came up with based on the plumbing, figures and materials, Wolfe said.Frankel said that in the old city hall, people would sometimes follow her into the bathroom, which was a security risk. In case of hurricanes, mayors have to work around the clock, too. So while she didnt ask for the private bathroom, she didnt veto it, either.  I thought it was a good idea, and I still do, she said. She left her successor ashower capwhen she left office in 2011.Hasners bathroom accessTo be fair, we researched the bathroom access Hasner had when he was a state legislator including House Majority leader. He had no special private bathroom, his campaign said.There is no bathroom in the Majority Leader's personal office or the larger majority office, said Ryan Duffy, spokesman for the House speaker. The closest bathroom is the public bathroom in the hallway outside the majority office.Our rulingAt last, we are ready to close the lid on this claim.Hasners ad said that Frankel spent $13,000 in taxpayer money on a marble shower in a private bathroom. The underlying message here is that Frankel engaged in government waste.But Frankel didnt have some sort of sole power here to make that bathroom happen. It was part of a much broader $150 million project approved by the City Commission.The city built a new city hall while Frankel was mayor that included a private bathroom for her. A gossip columnist obtained a statement from the builder at the time that said the bathroom/shower cost $13,323. We were unable to see that statement for ourselves.Hasners campaign says the shower alone cost $13,000. But the project executive who worked for the builder said that was the cost of the overall bathroom. And the builder decided to use that marble -- which wasnt in the architects plans -- because it was leftover from another job. There is no evidence that Frankel ordered up that marble.Whether a mayor needs a private bathroom and shower with or without marble is a decision we leave for the taxpayers. But we have seen no proof that the shower alone cost $13,000 -- that appears to be the overall price tag for the bathroom which was part of a $150 million project.We rate this claim Half True.", "hrefs": "https://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2012/oct/03/fact-checking-frankel-hasner-race-browardpalm-beac/"}], "label": "half-true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/oct/25/adam-hasner/adam-hasner-says-lois-frankel-used-police-chopper-/", "title": "While she was mayor, Lois Frankel took a police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party.", "author": "Amy Sherman", "posted": "10/25/2012", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["Republican congressional candidate Adam Hasner has accused his Democratic opponent Lois Frankel of hitching a ride on a police chopper that rushed her to a party when she was mayor of West Palm Beach.The incensed female narrator in Republican Hasners adGotta Gosays:That Lois Frankel is something.", "She gave herself a 40 percent pay raise.", "Charged us for a police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party.", "But the worst part?", "Frankel spent over $13,000 in taxpayer money on a marble shower in a private bathroom with her own toilet.", "What a waste.", "All that money right down the drain for her own personal use, says the narrator, who is revealed to be sitting on a toilet.When you gotta go, you gotta go but thats just ridiculous.The claims in the ad are similar to an ad by theYG Action Fund, a conservative PAC which showed Frankels headshot inside a cartoon image of a helicopter flying near a mansion with balloons falling from the sky.", "We fact-checked a claim by the PAC that Frankel got a40 percent pay raise while the city of West Palm Beach lost jobs.", "We rated that claimHalf Truebecause the pay raise was correct but the ad failed to accurately explain the jobs picture.", "We also looked at whether Frankel spent money ona marble shower.", "We rated thatHalf Trueas well.In this fact-check we will focus on Hasners claim that Frankel took a ride in the citys helicopter to go to a dinner party.", "We arent weighing in on whether it was a good decision by Frankel to take that ride -- our role is to evaluate whether Hasner accurately portrayed it.Hasner and Frankel, both former state legislators who have each raised just shy of $3 million, are competing in the Broward/Palm BeachCongressional District 22.", "Frankel was mayor of West Palm Beach between 2003 and 2011.Helicopter ride featured in gossip columnThe ad cites an April 2005Palm Beach Postarticleby gossip columnist Jose Lambiet.", "(He now writes a column for theMiami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida partner.", ")The article didnt state the date of the helicopter ride but said earlier this year Frankels aide drove her during rush hour to a homeowners association meeting, where she said she was there just to shake hands.About an hour later, a police chopper landed on the communitys golf course and Frankel was taken to a party downtown.", "The columnist described it as an affair thrown by Clematis-area merchants ticked off about -

Such audits are due at the end of the year, nearly two months after the votes are counted, a timetable noted in the very document the Doherty campaign cites.In the end, we have the former head of the Rhode Island State Police making allegations without key evidence, and ignoring evidence that points in another direction.Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate itMostly False.(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter:@politifactri.

The price is scheduled to increase to $30 a month in September.The additional cost is not what TriMet is concerned about -- it is the foregone passenger revenue, in the range of $2 million, Fetsch said.Shes right that the analysis is about the potential hit to TriMets revenue stream.

mailer we spotted May 7, 2012, including a double-digit claim about hizzoner and taxes.Lee raised property taxes 20 percent in three years, the mailer says.All that much, and by his lonesome?Fortuitously, we had in hand a chart provided by the Travis Central Appraisal District showing the tax rate set by the Austin City Council each year from 1990-91 through 2011-12.Before Leffingwell was elected mayor, the council set a rate of 40.12 cents per $100 of appraised value for 2008-09, meaning the fiscal year through September 2009.", "Last year, the Leffingwell-led council set a rate of 48.11 cents for 2011-12.", "Put another way, the liability on a property valued at $100,000 before Leffingwell became mayor was $401.20.", "The liability in 2011-12 was $481.10.On its face, thats a 20 percent increase over three years -- as referenced on the flip side of Shea's mailer, which says: Lee voted to raise your property tax rate 20 percent in three years.But no mayor can set a tax rate on his or her own, which Shea knows because shes a former council member.", "Each year, the seven-member council votes on the rate as it completes the citys budget.", "In Austins form of government, the mayor has one vote, like fellow council members.", "Asked by email about Sheas claim, the mayors campaign consultant, Mark Littlefield, said: Lee did not raise these taxes  the Austin City Council raised these taxes.Another wrinkle: Leffingwell, a retired airline pilot, was on the council before he ran for mayor and had a vote on city tax rates set for every budget starting in 2005-06.", "Through his council tenure, the tax rate has dipped and gone up, according to the appraisal districts breakdown.", "In Leffingwells first year on the council, members kept the previous years rate of 44.30 cents per $100 in appraised value.", "Members cut the rate each of the next three years before raising it each of the next three years.Ed Van Eenoo, the citys budget officer, told us the council voted 7-0 for the three tax-rate changes  all increases  with Leffingwell as mayor.However, tax-rate changes alone dont reveal the pocketbook impact of city property taxes.Notably, for instance, Leffingwell said recently that Austin has the lowest tax rate by far of the five biggest Texas cities.", "Thats so, but we rated his claimHalf Trueafter pointing out that any touting of tax rates is incomplete if it fails to fold in how much property-owners actually pay out.Thats because property valuations and tax exemptions also influence what property owners pay.", "To gauge the property taxes owed the city, for instance, take your houses dollar value; subtract any homestead or other exemptions; divide by 100; then multiply by the tax rate  with the tax rate expressed in dollars; for example, 0.4811 rather than 48.11 cents.Van Eenoo put it this way in an email reply to our inquiries about changes in the rates on the mayors watch: Simply looking at tax rates does not provide a complete analysis as tax rates are heavily influenced by home values.", "When property values go up, the revenue needed to maintain operations can generally be achieved at a lower tax rate.", "Vice versa when values go down as they did in 2010 and 2011.One way to evaluate property tax rates without ignoring the role of home values, Van Eenoo said, is to compare the tax rate adopted by the council with whats known as the rollback rate.", "Thats the maximum rate the city is allowed to set under state law without triggering a voter referendum.", "The rollback rate, Van Eenoo told us, is calculated as the rate that would bring in 8 percent more in revenue for operations and maintenance than in the previous year, plus enough money to pay the coming years debt service.In keeping with the time period behind Sheas claim, lets focus on Leffingwells mayoral years.In his first year leading the council, the tax rate set by the council was the rollback rate, as it had been for the previous three years.", "In the latter two years of Leffingwells mayorship, the adopted tax rates were lower than the rollback rate, Van Eenoo said.", "In those years, then, the council didnt raise taxes as much as it could have.Yet another measure that takes into account changes in property values is the effective tax rate.", "Thats the rate that the city would have to set to bring in roughly the same amount of revenue it received the year before on properties taxed in both years.", "In each year of Leffingwells mayoral term, according to city data, the councils adopted tax rate exceeded the effective rate; on average, the rate was nearly 4 percent higher.Looking beyond rates, we wondered how much typical homeowners city property tax bills had changed in the years Leffingwell has been mayor -- though we should note, of course, that the city is only one of the entities taxing Austin properties.", "Others include school districts, county government and community colleges.To support her statement that Leffingwell raised property taxes 20 percent in three years, Shea sent us data that she said showed tax bills for Austin homeowners had increased more than that amount since Leffingwell became mayor.Sheas analysis, which does not take into account exemptions, calculates annual tax bills using two different measures for home values: the median and average prices of homes sold in February of each year.", "Shea obtained the sales price information from the Texas A&M University Real Estate Center, which gathers data from real estate professionals across the state.Because averages can be skewed by a few very high or low values, taking the median value offers a way to dampen the effect of those extremes.", "Medians represent a middle value  median sales price would be the dollar amount at which half the city's homes sold for more and half sold for less.For this reason, we put aside Sheas data on average sale price and stuck with her figures for the median.", "Those show that the city tax bill for a home valued at the February median sales price increased about 23 percent from 2008-09 ($753) to 2011-12 ($924).Still, Sheas data relies on the prices of homes sold in a single month each year.", "Thats a small pool.", "We wondered whether there was a better representation of a typical Austin homeowners property value.We found one in data from the city: annual median taxable value.", "Samantha Park, a city spokeswoman, told us that the taxable value of a home is the amount on which the city can actually tax.", "Its based on the appraised value, determined by the countys assessment, minus exemptions.", "The median taxable value, then, is the value at which half the city's homes were valued at more and half were valued at less.Next, we used the citys data to calculate how much the city taxes on a home with the median taxable value had changed during Leffingwells mayoral term.", "Our calculations found an increase of about 25 percent from 2008-09 ($700) to 2011-12 ($877).", "Thats greater than the 20 percent Shea cited on her mailer.Another factor to consider: inflation.Adjusting Sheas tax bill figures for inflation reduces the size of the increase during Leffingwells mayorship to about 18 percent.", "Doing the same to the figures in our analysis of city data reduces the property tax increase to about 20 percent.We ran our work by the city.", "Park told us that our calculations of the city-provided data were fine, but that she had a quibble with our use of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index to account for inflation in property tax increases.The CPI, Park said, takes into account the change in price for goods and services purchased by households, not government services that are provided, which is what taxpayers are funding through their property tax bills.", "And she suggested that rising prices may be hitting governments harder than consumers.", "To illustrate her point, she noted that the price of a gallon of milk rises more slowly than the price of health care services for city employees.Also, she said, our analysis does not consider the cost of improvements in service delivery.", "As an example, she pointed to the City Councils decision to turn the thecitys animal shelter into a no-kill facility.We take this as saying the city chose to do more things  and those had costs.In response to the citys

incumbent Lee Leffingwell and activist Clay Dafoe, sent a mailer we spotted May 7, 2012, including a double-digit claim about hizzoner and taxes.Lee raised property taxes 20 percent in three years, the mailer says.All that much, and by his lonesome?Fortuitously, we had in hand a chart provided by the Travis Central Appraisal District showing the tax rate set by the Austin City Council each year from 1990-91 through 2011-12.Before Leffingwell was elected mayor, the council set a rate of 40.12 cents per $100 of appraised value for 2008-09, meaning the fiscal year through September 2009. Last year, the Leffingwell-led council set a rate of 48.11 cents for 2011-12. Put another way, the liability on a property valued at $100,000 before Leffingwell became mayor was $401.20. The liability in 2011-12 was $481.10.On its face, thats a 20 percent increase over three years -- as referenced on the flip side of Shea's mailer, which says: Lee voted to raise your property tax rate 20 percent in three years.But no mayor can set a tax rate on his or her own, which Shea knows because shes a former council member. Each year, the seven-member council votes on the rate as it completes the citys budget. In Austins form of government, the mayor has one vote, like fellow council members. Asked by email about Sheas claim, the mayors campaign consultant, Mark Littlefield, said: Lee did not raise these taxes  the Austin City Council raised these taxes.Another wrinkle: Leffingwell, a retired airline pilot, was on the council before he ran for mayor and had a vote on city tax rates set for every budget starting in 2005-06. Through his council tenure, the tax rate has dipped and gone up, according to the appraisal districts breakdown. In Leffingwells first year on the council, members kept the previous years rate of 44.30 cents per $100 in appraised value. Members cut the rate each of the next three years before raising it each of the next three years.Ed Van Eenoo, the citys budget officer, told us the council voted 7-0 for the three tax-rate changes  all increases  with Leffingwell as mayor.However, tax-rate changes alone dont reveal the pocketbook impact of city property taxes.Notably, for instance, Leffingwell said recently that Austin has the lowest tax rate by far of the five biggest Texas cities. Thats so, but we rated his claimHalf Trueafter pointing out that any touting of tax rates is incomplete if it fails to fold in how much property-owners actually pay out.Thats because property valuations and tax exemptions also influence what property owners pay. To gauge the property taxes owed the city, for instance, take your houses dollar value; subtract any homestead or other exemptions; divide by 100; then multiply by the tax rate  with the tax rate expressed in dollars; for example, 0.4811 rather than 48.11 cents.Van Eenoo put it this way in an email reply to our inquiries about changes in the rates on the mayors watch: Simply looking at tax rates does not provide a complete analysis as tax rates are heavily influenced by home values. When property values go up, the revenue needed to maintain operations can generally be achieved at a lower tax rate. Vice versa when values go down as they did in 2010 and 2011.One way to evaluate property tax rates without ignoring the role of home values, Van Eenoo said, is to compare the tax rate adopted by the council with whats known as the rollback rate. Thats the maximum rate the city is allowed to set under state law without triggering a voter referendum. The rollback rate, Van Eenoo told us, is calculated as the rate that would bring in 8 percent more in revenue for operations and maintenance than in the previous year, plus enough money to pay the coming years debt service.In keeping with the time period behind Sheas claim, lets focus on Leffingwells mayoral years.In his first year leading the council, the tax rate set by the council was the rollback rate, as it had been for the previous three years. In the latter two years of Leffingwells mayorship, the adopted tax rates were lower than the rollback rate, Van Eenoo said. In those years, then, the council didnt raise taxes as much as it could have.Yet another measure that takes into account changes in property values is the effective tax rate. Thats the rate that the city would have to set to bring in roughly the same amount of revenue it received the year before on properties taxed in both years. In each year of Leffingwells mayoral term, according to city data, the councils adopted tax rate exceeded the effective rate; on average, the rate was nearly 4 percent higher.Looking beyond rates, we wondered how much typical homeowners city property tax bills had changed in the years Leffingwell has been mayor -- though we should note, of course, that the city is only one of the entities taxing Austin properties. Others include school districts, county government and community colleges.To support her statement that Leffingwell raised property taxes 20 percent in three years, Shea sent us data that she said showed tax bills for Austin homeowners had increased more than that amount since Leffingwell became mayor.Sheas analysis, which does not take into account exemptions, calculates annual tax bills using two different measures for home values: the median and average prices of homes sold in February of each year. Shea obtained the sales price information from the Texas A&M University Real Estate Center, which gathers data from real estate professionals across the state.Because averages can be skewed by a few very high or low values, taking the median value offers a way to dampen the effect of those extremes. Medians represent a middle value  median sales price would be the dollar amount at which half the city's homes sold for more and half sold for less.For this reason, we put aside Sheas data on average sale price and stuck with her figures for the median. Those show that the city tax bill for a home valued at the February median sales price increased about 23 percent from 2008-09 ($753) to 2011-12 ($924).Still, Sheas data relies on the prices of homes sold in a single month each year. Thats a small pool. We wondered whether there was a better representation of a typical Austin homeowners property value.We found one in data from the city: annual median taxable value. Samantha Park, a city spokeswoman, told us that the taxable value of a home is the amount on which the city can actually tax. Its based on the appraised value, determined by the countys assessment, minus exemptions. The median taxable value, then, is the value at which half the city's homes were valued at more and half were valued at less.Next, we used the citys data to calculate how much the city taxes on a home with the median taxable value had changed during Leffingwells mayoral term. Our calculations found an increase of about 25 percent from 2008-09 ($700) to 2011-12 ($877). Thats greater than the 20 percent Shea cited on her mailer.Another factor to consider: inflation.Adjusting Sheas tax bill figures for inflation reduces the size of the increase during Leffingwells mayorship to about 18 percent. Doing the same to the figures in our analysis of city data reduces the property tax increase to about 20 percent.We ran our work by the city. Park told us that our calculations of the city-provided data were fine, but that she had a quibble with our use of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index to account for inflation in property tax increases.The CPI, Park said, takes into account the change in price for goods and services purchased by households, not government services that are provided, which is what taxpayers are funding through their property tax bills. And she suggested that rising prices may be hitting governments harder than consumers. To illustrate her point, she noted that the price of a gallon of milk rises more slowly than the price of health care services for city employees.Also, she said, our analysis does not consider the cost of improvements in service delivery. As an example, she pointed to the City Councils decision to turn the thecitys animal shelter into a no-kill facility.We take this as saying the city chose to do more things  and those had costs.In response to the citys concern about the CPI, we used a different index  one from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis that gauges inflation for state and local governments  to adjust the tax bill figures in Sheas and our data. That reduces the increases by only half a percentage point compared to our calculations using the CPI.Our rulingMindful that tax rates alone paint an incomplete picture of the impact of property taxes, which are also driven by changes in property values, we found that what a typical Austin homeowner  one with the median-value home  paid in taxes went up 25 percent in the three years that Leffingwells served as Austin mayor. Adjusted for inflation, that figure drops somewhat, but is still about 20 percent.So, taxes went up 20 percent, or more, with Leffingwell as mayor.However, no Austin mayor can raise taxes solo commando. Leffingwell had one of the seven votes that were cast each year in setting the citys rates.

He could make an even more shocking statement if he wanted to, Robyn said.Over a longer period, the real estate groups numbers show even more disparity.Michael Wilt, the groups director of government relations, told us by phone, What our numbers indicate is that since 1989, the median family income has doubled but the combined tax burden has tripled.His group maintains the index to remind local government of of these aspects, he said. The main statement is that the cost of government is outpacing the median income.Robyn said that such a conclusion would most likely hold even if the numbers were adjusted for inflation. With inflation factored in, he said, change in income over time might not be 27 percent, and the change in tax bill over time might not be 48 percent, but overall, tax bills should still be outpacing income.We tracked down the data independently from the sources Engelking used.From the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, we learned Austins median family incomes were $58,900 in 2000 and $74,900 in 2011, a 27 percent increase. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city (rather than the Austin metropolitan statistical area, which is larger) had265,649 householdsin 2000 and 330,010 households in 2011. Austins demographer, Ryan Robinson, told us by phone that the city calculates its own numbers for non-census years, and said he probably supplied Engelking with an October 2011 quarterly estimate of 333,815 households.Austins budget office gave us the citys total sales tax revenue for 2000 ($122.2 million) and 2011 ($151.2 million), as well as total utility dollars transferred to the city in 2000 ($78.4 million) and 2011 ($134.3 million). The Travis Central Appraisal District sent us average taxable home values and city property tax rates for those years.Next we ran the math, and found that one of Austins 265,649 households in 2000 would have paid an average of $461 in city sales taxes and seen $295 of its utility fees transferred back to the general fund. If that household owned a home worth the citys average taxable value ($138,674, in 2000), its city property tax bill would have been $647, at the 2000 rate of 46.63 cents per $100.That yields a tax burden of $1,402 for an average Austin household, in a year when HUD gives Austins median family income as $58,900.In 2011, according to the same sources, one of Austins 333,815 households would have paid $453 in city sales tax, $407 in utility transfers and -- if the homes taxable value was $254,328, the average for Austin in 2011 -- a city property tax bill of $1,224.Thats a total $2,084 burden in a year when HUD estimates Austin median family income was $74,900.The real estate group, by way of contrast, got a tax burden of $1,368 for 2000 and $2,030 for 2011. So our results were $34 higher for 2000 and $54 higher for 2011.In all cases, however, the percentage of change held up: That tax burden rose 48 percent from 2000 to 2011, whether calculated by us or by the real estate council.City budget officer Ed Van Eenoo told us by email that he had a few concerns with the index. Dividing sales tax revenue and utility transfers by the number of Austin households inflates the apparent burden, he said, because its not just city residents paying into both of those pools. The utilities serve an area larger than the city, and business-to-business sales as well as out-of-town visitors contribute sales tax dollars. He also objected to calling the utility transfers a tax.Engelking said sales tax, utility transfers and property tax are the three largest revenue streams going into the citys general fund. She agreed that utility transfers arent a tax, but said that the goal of the index is to track the costs of government, as indicated by its name. If utility transfers were excluded, she said, youd be missing really important money that people do pay to fund city government.Our rulingChavez drew on a calculation that checks out, though the citys suggested caveats seem worthy of consideration.

Leaders there raised the issue of contract workers with Nick Fish soon after he inherited the bureau in January.

She's the reason it got scaled back.The City Council eventually agreed to a one-year renewal, not five years. But we still wanted to know how renewing a contract for a shorter period of time reduced the use of Brooks workers.Tim Crail, a spokesman for Fritz, explained that the shortened time period prompted Fishs office, the parks bureau and labor leaders to negotiate moving classifications, which has resulted in a reduced reliance on the Brooks contract to fill certain job classifications. Thus the reduction from 100 to 40, he wrote.But for Commissioner Fritz questioning the five year extension on February 25th, 2009, the changes would not have occurred.Yet thats not what happened. Crail didnt have the number of positions recategorized. The contract and its amendments, which we requested, did not change. And Fish told us that talks between parks and labor didnt result in a new agreement on when to use contract workers.Fish cant recall how the parks bureau came to reduce its reliance on Brooks. It may have been a combination of concerted effort and scheduling as allowed under the 1,200-hour rule. (By the way, the maximum is now 1,400 hours a year.)It was both my belief, her belief and, ultimately, the bureau position that we would lessen our reliance on these positions, Fish said. Its clear we did not want it used as much.So, how do we rule on Fritzs statement?The commissioner accurately states that she questioned the use of contract employees at the bureau. Its also accurate for her to say that from 2009 to 2011, the number of contract employees used by the parks bureau went from 100 to 40. What Fritz has not showed is that but for her questioning, the changes would not have occurred.After all, Fish had concerns about the use of contract workers. Labor had concerns. The terms of the Brooks contract did not change materially after 2009. The city, notably, did not reclassify positions to favor direct hires, as her office claims.Certainly Fritzs questioning helped prompt a council-level discussion about an issue dear to the union and troubling to the parks commissioner.

After implementing rigorous and robust strategic reform initiatives, 100% of the high schools improved their performance as evidenced by all of them receiving a grade of 'C' or higher (mostly 'A' and 'B'), he wrote.After seeing his claim summarized in a March 26 Journal story about the controversy surrounding his then-pending appointment, we decided to check his claim.His letter includes a chart detailing improvements -- some substantial -- in the letter grade given to each school by the Florida Department of Education.The grade improvements above are one of the many transformations that NAEP Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey J. Hernandez was responsible for as a district administrator, the chart says. NAEP is National Academic Educational Partners Inc. During the 2009-2010 school year, Hernandez was Palm Beach County's chief academic officer.We confirmed all the grades with the Florida Department of Education, although the dates given in the chart are misleading. (It suggests the results compare the two school years from 2009-2011; it's actually 2008-2010.)Among the seven high schools that had a D rating in 2009, when Hernandez began his job at the district, two rose to a C in 2010, three increased to a B and two jumped to an A.Among the three C-level schools, two rose to a B and one jumped to an A. (The 11th school started out with a ranking of B and jumped to an A.)Overall, 54 percent of the schools showed a higher grade and none showed a lower ranking.That's pretty impressive. But was Hernandez, who was employed by the district for just one year, responsible?For comparison, we looked at the grades for high schools in Broward County, just to the south of Palm Beach County. It turns out that those schools had a great year as well -- without Hernandez's involvement. In the Broward County school system, 53 percent of the 34 high schools got a higher grade in the spring of 2010 while 3 percent (one school) showed a decline.So we looked atallFlorida high schools, excluding those in Palm Beach for that time period.Just over half -- 51 percent -- saw their grades increase for 2010.So not only were the Palm Beach high schools getting better grades when Hernandez was in charge of academics, schools throughout Florida were getting higher scores as well.The reason: the state changed its grading system. For example, the formula used to determine a school's grade began including graduation rates and accelerated course work.I would expect to see a difference between '08-'09 and '09-'10 because the formula for high school grades changed in that time frame, said Jane Fletcher, director of accountability and policy research at the Florida Department of Education. It's not surprising at all.When we called Hernandez to ask about the grade inflation statewide, he said, I can't say what was happening in other districts. I can only say what happened in the district that I was working on.We did see one difference between Hernandez's district and the rest of Florida. Palm Beach high schools showed a greater propensity to improve more than one letter grade. While 16 percent of Florida's high schools showed a jump of two or more letter grades (such as from a D to a B), 27 percent of Palm Beach schools made that type of jump.Our rulingJeffrey Hernandez said that after implementing his reform measures, 100% of the [10 lowest performing high schools in Palm Beach] improved their performance as evidenced by all of them receiving a grade of 'C' or higher.He is correct that there was improvement -- those low-performing schools did pull better grades (two went from a D to an A). But that was part of a larger trend, prompted by a change in the grading system, that caused half of all high schools throughout the state to score better.We think that's an key omission, one that Hernandez should be making clear when he talks about his record and one that Providence should have known about when the School Department decided to hire him.We rate his statementHalf True.(Get updates fromPolitiFactRI on Twitter.

the state, and 10 percent from the federal government.", "Pazmino told us McEachin based his statement on his belief that cash-strapped localities would be forced to slash their spending on classroom instruction to pay their $1 billion bill for teacher pensions over the next two budget years.Localities are paying a collective $472 million for teacher pensions during the current budget biennium, according to the Virginia Retirement System.School boards all across the state are screaming and theyre not saying, Were getting more money, Pazmino said.", "Theyre all saying that this thing equals cuts.Pazmino sent us about a dozen news articles quoting local school officials across the state saying the pension contributions will create shortfalls in their budgets.", "The predictions came from educators in Virginia Beach, Lynchburg, Charlottesville, Waynesboro, Roanoke, Staunton and Suffolk.", "They said the slight increase in state funds their school systems might receive under McDonnells proposal would be dwarfed by increased pension payments.", "Several officials raised the possibility of teacher layoffs or tax increases to balance their budgets.Officials at the the Virginia Association of School Superintendents say they recently surveyed 85 of Virginias 132 local school divisions and found more than 90 percent of them were anticipating significant shortfalls based on the governors budget.Locally, Hanover County public schools estimate McDonnells budget would increase its pension contribution by $5.8 million while adding only $1.6 million is state aid.", "Chesterfield

"Scott Walker unveiled his controversial curbs on collective bargaining, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett blasted away.Milwaukee, Barrett said, could get health and pension concessions from public employees at the bargaining table withoutattacking workers rightsand trying toobliterate people.The mayor, who ran against Walker in the 2010 election,backed the decisionby Senate Democrats to flee to Illinois to block a quorum on Walkers bill.Eight months later, the Democratic mayor took advantage of a key plank in Walkers bill to help save millions on health insurance costs and balancethe city budgetwithout having to negotiate with city unions.", "In the past, the city would have had to negotiate such a change.Not after Walkers move.As the Milwaukee Common Council considers Barretts budget proposal, and some in labor launch barbs at him, it seems like a good time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter.First, our requisite reminder: The Flip-O-Meter measures whether a political figure has changed positions.", "It does not evaluate whether any move is good politics or good policy.", "Some will see a change as being open to new ideas, others as political pandering.Now, a brief history lesson:On Feb. 11, 2011, Walker introduced what became Act 10, the historic budget-repair bill that required state employees to pay more for health insurance and pensions, as part of his move to take away most collective bargaining rights from most public workers.", "Protesters flocked to Madison and occupied the Capitol rotunda for weeks.The bill also extended the state-employee benefit cuts to local municipalities and schools by taking health and pension out of bargaining for most unions at the local level as well.", "The law requires local communities whose employees are in the state health plan for local governments to move to start charging employees 12 percent toward health care premiums.Milwaukee is not in that plan, so it was free to set whatever level of cost sharing it wanted.These tools, Walker said, would help local governments make up for the big cuts in local education and municipal aid he proposed March 1, 2011, to close a $3 billion shortfall in the next two-year  budget.So, did Barrett change his position by using one of the tools that the bill handed to local governments?We reviewed Barretts public statements and actions as recorded in dozens of news stories, speeches and press conferences in 2011.Barrett immediately started a nuanced two-step dance in his public statements -- objecting to some parts of the proposal while saying other parts were necessary.Lets start with whether Barretts rhetoric was consistent, before comparing his deeds to his words.The approach toward unions: Barrett, who was supported by nearly all public unions except police and fire in the 2010 governors race, made clear he thought Walker overreached with some of Act 10 in ways that Barrett saw as union busting.Walker wanted to make it harder for unions to collect dues and remain certified, as well as eliminate nearly all collective bargaining -- moves that some said would shrink unions into irrelevance or put them out of business.Walker was messing with the fundamental right to organize,Barrett saidwithin days of Walkers February announcement.", "Its an ideological war to try to crush labor, Barrett said a few weeks later wheninterviewed on MSNBCs Rachel Maddowshow on March 7, 2011.Barrett didnt specify which of the bills provisions he felt crossed the line into union busting.", "But he made clear he believed he could have used the rough and tumble of collective bargaining with unions to get concessions similar to what Walker wanted.Impact on city budget: Barrett predicted that Milwaukees budget would come out a big loser due to the aid cuts in Walkers two-year budget.", "Hesaid in Marchthat the combination of aid cuts, rising expenses, a levy freeze and exempting public safety workers from benefit changes just makes our structural deficit explode.Walker said just the opposite, and he was right: By August, city estimates showed a potential gain of at least $11 million from the two separate state budget bills.Most of the savings, theJournal Sentinel reported in August, could come from health care benefit changes that Barrett didn't have to negotiate with unions -- thanks to Walkers changes.So we saw Barrett criticizing the bill in pretty stark terms -- inaccurately in one case.", "But he liked some of it, and even wanted more.Heres where this gets interesting.Paying more: The mayor -- early and often -- said public employees wouldhave to pay more,needed to pay more, and the public wanted them to pay more.Its notable that Barrett said that even before the big public unions publicly said they wouldswallow Walkers financial demandsif he dropped the limits on bargaining.With an eye on solving his own budget problems, Barrett said Feb. 22, 2011, thathed support city employees payingthe same higher contributions as state workers.", "He evencredited Walkerfor paving the way by getting a mandate in his election win for raising state pension and health contributions.And the mayor sought to push state lawmakers to go even further than Walker, who had proposed exempting public safety unions from the collective bargaining limits.", "Hecalled onlawmakers to subject police and fire unions to the same bargaining limits as other public employee unions so the sacrifice could be shared among all workers.Barrett minced no words.", "He said the law enforcement retirement and health benefits wereCadillac.The mayor went further.As the standoff with AWOL Democrats continued over Walkers bill, Barrett called Feb. 24, 2011, for analternativeto Walkers bill.Specifically, he said the GOP should set aside the sharp limits on union bargaining and just vote on requiring the benefits changes.As the Journal Sentinel reported, Barrett would impose the health care and pension changes and extend those changes to all public employees, leaving the rest of the budget-repair bill's provisions for separate debate later.He alsoasked Republican lawmakersto require city of Milwaukee workers to pay 12 percent of their health premiums -- just as Walker was proposing for state employees and some municipal workers not in Milwaukee.Mandate the benefits changes at a specific level?That would mean having the state dictate what amount Milwaukee workers should pay.", "Thats a far cry from local collective bargaining and would have taken away some flexibility on letting some communities decide what to impose.Was Barrett sending out mixed signals -- criticizing excessive excessive limits on collective bargaining, while he endorsed scrapping them for health care, one of the biggest-ticket items?Barrett told us his statements were not meant to endorse limits on health care bargaining.", "When we asked how else his proposal would have imposed greater health contributions on local workers, he said he was only

Scott Walker unveiled his controversial curbs on collective bargaining, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett blasted away.Milwaukee, Barrett said, could get health and pension concessions from public employees at the bargaining table withoutattacking workers rightsand trying toobliterate people.The mayor, who ran against Walker in the 2010 election,backed the decisionby Senate Democrats to flee to Illinois to block a quorum on Walkers bill.Eight months later, the Democratic mayor took advantage of a key plank in Walkers bill to help save millions on health insurance costs and balancethe city budgetwithout having to negotiate with city unions. In the past, the city would have had to negotiate such a change.Not after Walkers move.As the Milwaukee Common Council considers Barretts budget proposal, and some in labor launch barbs at him, it seems like a good time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter.First, our requisite reminder: The Flip-O-Meter measures whether a political figure has changed positions. It does not evaluate whether any move is good politics or good policy. Some will see a change as being open to new ideas, others as political pandering.Now, a brief history lesson:On Feb. 11, 2011, Walker introduced what became Act 10, the historic budget-repair bill that required state employees to pay more for health insurance and pensions, as part of his move to take away most collective bargaining rights from most public workers. Protesters flocked to Madison and occupied the Capitol rotunda for weeks.The bill also extended the state-employee benefit cuts to local municipalities and schools by taking health and pension out of bargaining for most unions at the local level as well. The law requires local communities whose employees are in the state health plan for local governments to move to start charging employees 12 percent toward health care premiums.Milwaukee is not in that plan, so it was free to set whatever level of cost sharing it wanted.These tools, Walker said, would help local governments make up for the big cuts in local education and municipal aid he proposed March 1, 2011, to close a $3 billion shortfall in the next two-year  budget.So, did Barrett change his position by using one of the tools that the bill handed to local governments?We reviewed Barretts public statements and actions as recorded in dozens of news stories, speeches and press conferences in 2011.Barrett immediately started a nuanced two-step dance in his public statements -- objecting to some parts of the proposal while saying other parts were necessary.Lets start with whether Barretts rhetoric was consistent, before comparing his deeds to his words.The approach toward unions: Barrett, who was supported by nearly all public unions except police and fire in the 2010 governors race, made clear he thought Walker overreached with some of Act 10 in ways that Barrett saw as union busting.Walker wanted to make it harder for unions to collect dues and remain certified, as well as eliminate nearly all collective bargaining -- moves that some said would shrink unions into irrelevance or put them out of business.Walker was messing with the fundamental right to organize,Barrett saidwithin days of Walkers February announcement. Its an ideological war to try to crush labor, Barrett said a few weeks later wheninterviewed on MSNBCs Rachel Maddowshow on March 7, 2011.Barrett didnt specify which of the bills provisions he felt crossed the line into union busting. But he made clear he believed he could have used the rough and tumble of collective bargaining with unions to get concessions similar to what Walker wanted.Impact on city budget: Barrett predicted that Milwaukees budget would come out a big loser due to the aid cuts in Walkers two-year budget. Hesaid in Marchthat the combination of aid cuts, rising expenses, a levy freeze and exempting public safety workers from benefit changes just makes our structural deficit explode.Walker said just the opposite, and he was right: By August, city estimates showed a potential gain of at least $11 million from the two separate state budget bills.Most of the savings, theJournal Sentinel reported in August, could come from health care benefit changes that Barrett didn't have to negotiate with unions -- thanks to Walkers changes.So we saw Barrett criticizing the bill in pretty stark terms -- inaccurately in one case. But he liked some of it, and even wanted more.Heres where this gets interesting.Paying more: The mayor -- early and often -- said public employees wouldhave to pay more,needed to pay more, and the public wanted them to pay more.Its notable that Barrett said that even before the big public unions publicly said they wouldswallow Walkers financial demandsif he dropped the limits on bargaining.With an eye on solving his own budget problems, Barrett said Feb. 22, 2011, thathed support city employees payingthe same higher contributions as state workers. He evencredited Walkerfor paving the way by getting a mandate in his election win for raising state pension and health contributions.And the mayor sought to push state lawmakers to go even further than Walker, who had proposed exempting public safety unions from the collective bargaining limits. Hecalled onlawmakers to subject police and fire unions to the same bargaining limits as other public employee unions so the sacrifice could be shared among all workers.Barrett minced no words. He said the law enforcement retirement and health benefits wereCadillac.The mayor went further.As the standoff with AWOL Democrats continued over Walkers bill, Barrett called Feb. 24, 2011, for analternativeto Walkers bill.Specifically, he said the GOP should set aside the sharp limits on union bargaining and just vote on requiring the benefits changes.As the Journal Sentinel reported, Barrett would impose the health care and pension changes and extend those changes to all public employees, leaving the rest of the budget-repair bill's provisions for separate debate later.He alsoasked Republican lawmakersto require city of Milwaukee workers to pay 12 percent of their health premiums -- just as Walker was proposing for state employees and some municipal workers not in Milwaukee.Mandate the benefits changes at a specific level?That would mean having the state dictate what amount Milwaukee workers should pay. Thats a far cry from local collective bargaining and would have taken away some flexibility on letting some communities decide what to impose.Was Barrett sending out mixed signals -- criticizing excessive excessive limits on collective bargaining, while he endorsed scrapping them for health care, one of the biggest-ticket items?Barrett told us his statements were not meant to endorse limits on health care bargaining. When we asked how else his proposal would have imposed greater health contributions on local workers, he said he was only trying to goad GOP legislators and Walker into a separate vote on the limits.Enough with the words.Now lets look at Barretts deeds in summer and fall of 2011, when it came time to decide whether to use the tools.In September 2011, as he prepared his budget proposal, Barrett was free to impose more health-care cost sharing because the GOP had removed it as a mandatory subject of bargaining by the budget-repair bill.He did so, at basically the same level as the bill required for state employees (12 percent). It was a big key to balancing his budget while avoiding major cuts.He also followed through on his promise to get the police and fire unions -- with whom he still has to bargain -- to agree or to consider paying more towards health insurance.

When you look at what they get paid, they are one of the lowest, if not the lowest, paid fire departments in the state and entire region.We wondered if that was true. So we decided to check it out.First, we called Andriole, who faxed us a three-page chart he and the unions business manager use in contract negotiations which shows the annual wages for 33 Rhode Island fire districts whose firefighters have union contracts.The list compares the top base pay rate for firefighters. These Private First-Class firefighters comprise the bulk of most local forces. (Firefighters with less than a year on the job typically earn less;  lieutenants, captains, battalion chiefs and other officers earn more.)In Central Falls, the top base pay for those firefighters is $44,892.08 per year. (Thats after the state-receiver this month reinstated a 2 percent pay raise that the firefighters had agreed to forgo last January.)Based on the unions list, Central Falls appears to have one of the lowest base pay rates in Rhode Island. (We spot-checked the list for accuracy.)We found two fire districts where the base pay was lower than in Central Falls: North Providence ($90 a year less) and the Lime Rock Fire Department in Lincoln ($1,200 a year less).The firefighters with the highest base pay on Andrioles list are in Warwick, where the top base pay rate as of July was $62,422.But the comparison leaves out other compensation, including one of the biggest pay boosters: overtime.In the fiscal year that ended June 30, Central Falls firefighters received a total of $545,339 in overtime pay -- an average of about $13,300 per firefighter. (The overtime pay in fiscal 2009 and 2010 averaged about $413,000, or roughly $10,000 per firefighter.) Short-staffing tends to drive up overtime pay because of minimum-staffing rules.Central Falls isnt unusual in that regard. In North Providence, overtime pay for firefighters during the same period was roughly $21,000, on average, per firefighter -- more than double the average in Central Falls.But Andriole says that overtime shouldnt be factored into the pay comparisons, since its not guaranteed. He conceded, though, that one could argue that other forms of pay guaranteed under union contracts -- such as longevity, holiday pay -- should be included.Central Falls firefighters with five years on the job get longevity pay of $1,500 a year. Those with 20 or more years on the job get $3,000 a year.And then theres holiday pay. Central Falls firefighters currently get an additional 10 paid holidays a year, or roughly $2,100 a year.Firefighters also get annual allowances for uniforms and, in some cases, clothing.Until recently, Central Falls firefighters got a uniform allowance of $975 a year plus a $1,000 a year clothing allowance. (The uniform allowance was recently eliminated under an agreement between the firefighters union and the state-appointed receiver.)So if you add in overtime, holiday pay, longevity pay and clothing allowances, the annual pay for a firefighter in Central Falls with five years on the job climbs to more than $58,000 a year.Thats significantly more, for example, than firefighters in the Lime Rock Fire Department in neighboring Lincoln.Lime Rock is one of two fire districts in the town with paid firefighters; the others are all volunteer.  The department responds to about 600 to 650 fire calls per year -- just under half of the calls the Central Falls department handles.Lime Rocks top-paid privates earn $43,680 per year. No overtime. No longevity pay.  And their  uniform allowance is $700.As far as how Central Falls firefighters pay stacks up with the rest of the region, thats harder to say.(Nationally, the median annual income for firefighters last year was $45,250 -- $358 more than the Central Falls base pay -- according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.)By region, Andriole explained, hed meant Massachusetts and Connecticut. We found no master lists, but did some spot-checks.The base pay for firefighters in Hartford, Conn., -- a city more than six times the size of Central Falls -- is $45,857. Thats $965 a year more than Central Falls firefighters are paid. After five years, Hartford firefighters base pay rises to $68,073 -- $10,000 more than in Central Falls.The base pay for firefighters in Holyoke, Mass., -- an old mill city similar to Central Falls, -- is $49,011 -- about $4,100 more than in Central Falls.But Holyokes firefighters earned, on average, less than half of what firefighters in Central Falls earned during each of the last three fiscal years in in overtime pay.The point is that firefighters can, and often do, earn a lot more than their base pay.In short, Andriole was right when he said that Central Falls firefighters pay is among the lowest in the state and region -- but he was talking only about base pay.He left out some important context - namely, all of the other compensation firefighters receive -- which is why we rate his statementMostly True.", "hrefs": "http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/local_news/blackstone/cf-consolidation-talks-on-going"}, {"sentence": "(Get updates fromPolitiFactRI on Twitter.

the state had provided The Journal with a list of all retired Central Falls police officers and firefighters receiving pensions.Of the 143 pensions on the list, 52 are labeled disability pensions, which amounts to 36.4 percent, very close to the 37 percent that Lisauskas cited.However, the list indicates 15 of the 52 disability pensions have been converted to ordinary pensions because of the age of the retirees.", "So, to be accurate, its currently 26 percent.Now, on the bigger question: How does Central Falls stack up with the rest of the country?First, we tried the Pew Center on the States, which collects information about public employee pensions.", "The center had no data on disability rates.Then we called the National Association of Retirement Administrators, which also said it was unaware of any data on disability pension rates.Surely, we thought, the International Association of Fire Fighters in Washington, D.C., would know.Im not sure theres a database anywhere that can answer that question, Lori Moore-Merrell, assistant to the associations general president, said, because the pension systems are so different and they differ from state to state.So we did some spot checks.The Rhode Island Municipal Employees Retirement System (MERS), a collection of plans run by the state, covers some police and firefighters in Cranston, Woonsocket and several smaller communities.Of the 547 recipients of police and firefighter pensions in MERS, 113 -- about 21 percent -- receive disability pensions, according to Dara Chadwick, spokeswoman for the state retirement system.", "Thats less than the share of disabled retirees in Central Falls -- but  nowhere near what Lisauskas said is a 5-percent national average.Then, we checked outside our area code.Not all state or municipal pension systems track disability rates for retired police officers and firefighters, but we found a few that did.", "(Some figures are from this year, others are from 2010.)", "In New York state, the share of retired police officers and firefighters receiving disability pensions is 19.25 percent.", "(The plan does not include New York City.", ")In Ohio, its just under 35 percent.In Indiana, its 24 percent.In California, the state pension system lumps police and firefighters with correctional officers and school safety personnel, so it wasnt comparable.", "But we learned that San Jose, Calif., had analyzed its pension costs for police and firefighters, so we checked there.Robin Opheim, senior performance auditor in the San Joses auditors office, said  67 percent of the citys retired firefighters and 41 percent of retired police officers were receiving disability pensions as of February 2010.Rhode Island, New York, Ohio, Indiana and San Jose all have double-digit disability rates for retired firefighters and police officers.", "So where did Lisauskas come up with a 5-percent national average?We called him back to find out.", "The 5-percent average, he told us, came from actuaries hed spoken to at Buck Consultants, based in New York City.", "(As it happens, Buck Consultants is the actuary for the City of Providence.", ")So we called Bucks headquarters.Im not aware of any formal study that Bucks done in that area, Buck spokesman Ed Gadowski said.", "...

Frances Gallo, saying that management of the state-funded district is erratic at best and incompetent at worst.  State money is being used to operate the schools, and some of that money is being wasted and used irresponsibly.Were not about to wade into a controversy over who should be leading the school system. Gallo and the schools have made national news for reform efforts that have kept administrators and the teachers locked in a nasty fray for more than a year.But we were curious about one example Tassoni gave of questionable financial decisions. In his press release, he stated that he has learned that the department spent $100,000 on a time clock.Really? Could a time clock cost that much?Without punching in, we got right to work on this one.When we met with Tassoni, he showed us three Central Falls school district documents that he  called purchase orders. He noted that each made reference to a time clock and that each had a different total: $40,543.64, $55,414.68 and $5,581.68.So he added them up. Grand total: $101,540.That $100,000 disturbed me -- $100,000 for a time clock? he said.A first glance at the documents, however, reveals that theres a great deal more to the purchase than a time clock. Two of the documents specify the order was for  TimeClock Plus 6.0 Professional. Theres enough detail to make clear its a computerized system.Its not just a clock. Its a whole system, Gallo said when we contacted her. Its automated and has brought us out of antiquity into a truly networked system.We pictured Fred Flintstoneending his day at Slate Rock and Gravel Company by simply  sticking his time card into a dinosaurs mouth. And we recalled those classic wall-mounted clocks, the kind Moocher, in the movie Breaking Away,smashes with his fistwhen his boss  says,  Dont forget to punch the clock, Shorty.What can the new system do better? And how does it work?No one sticks a card into a clock in Central Falls schools anymore. Hourly employees place a finger on a scanner to record their arrival and departure. Their fingerprints are checked to verify their identity. Forget punching in for a friend who hasnt shown up for work.The clocks relay employees hours to payroll systems, reducing the time staff must spend processing cards and avoiding human error that could result in payment mistakes, according to Giovanna Venditti, the School Departments director of finance, and Kathy Gaouette, director of human resources.The system can notify administrators when employees are approaching overtime. TimeClock can also ease record-keeping by tracking which hours should be paid out of the general fund or from an account set up for a specific grant, they said.Of the 500 full- and part-time employees who support the 2,800-student district, only 182 mostly non-salaried employees -- including maintenance workers, crossing guards, bus monitors and drivers -- use the new system. But the district wants its 340 teachers to agree to use it, too.Now back to those documents that Tassoni used to support his $100,000 claim. Only two are actual purchase orders, said Venditti.One for $55,598.68, dated March 15, 2010, was for hardware, software, licensing fees, training and systems support. The purchase included 11 time clocks -- not one -- for nine school buildings.The other purchase order, for $5,581, dated Feb. 23, 2011, was to renew a technical support agreement  for the TimeClock system for another year.And that third document, the one with the $40,539 total? Its just a packing slip. Unlike the other two documents, it does not say purchase order at the top in large bold letters or include any similar information, such as a  P.O. date or P.O. issued to.  Data Management Inc., of San Angelo, Texas, simply included it in a shipment of items it sent to Central Falls. The packing slip didnt total $55,598, the amount of the purchase order, because the $13,442 fingerprint scanning equipment and one other item were shipped separately.So Tassoni, by simply adding the totals of the three documents, counted some items twice, inflating the original purchase of $55,598.68 (excluding the systems support renewal) by nearly 75 percent.It is not $100,000, said Venditti,  the finance director.TimeClock was recommended by UniFund, the New Hampshire company that sold Central Falls its BudgetSense financial software, which helps the schools meet state financial reporting requirements. The programs are compatible.Like Central Falls, Barrington purchased TimeClock at the advice of UniFund. The town paid only $18,996, said Ronald Tarro, director of administration and finance -- a lot less than Central. Falls. But Barrington bought two fewer clocks and decided not to pay extra for the fingerprint technology. Barrington schools use badges instead.Barringtons costs are also substantially lower because only 25 non-salaried maintenance and custodial staff are using TimeClock. Data Management charges a fee based on the number of users--$15 for each of the 500 employees that Central Falls wants to use the clocks.With the clock still running, where does this leave us?For starters, Tassoni could have asked school officials about the documents he was shown. Instead, the senator -- who publishes a union newspaper and is a former union administrator -- simply added up the totals on the three documents to push his case against the school leadership. Thats flimsy backup for saying he learned of a $100,000 expenditure and, then, choosing two words out of context, calling the purchase a time clock.It clearly was not just a time clock. And it didnt cost $100,000. The total was just over half that (plus the annual support contracts which are typical of software purchases).When he turned over the documents to PolitiFact, Tassoni even admitted, I could be all wet.He IS all wet. But not to worry. Were going to flame-dry his Dockers with aPants on Fire!(Get updates fromPolitiFactRI on Twitter.

But he acknowledged that the city commonly keeps roughly that many police positions vacant.Troy Hamblin, the city labor negotiator, said the city has hired an average of 79 police recruits per year since Barrett was elected mayor in 2004. Based on that number, he said the lower training wage would save the city $1.09 million through 2011 -- about half the unions estimate.So, the union is banking on the city more than doubling its usual police hiring in order for the $2.08 million through 2011 to be saved. A more realistic number would be about half that.Those aspects relate directly to the immediate savings. The next is the central part of the claim of saving $184 million over 25 years.New hire pension contributionsThe newspaper ad says that if new hires make contributions to their pensions -- current employees represented by MPA make none -- the city would save $184 million over the next 25 years.Thats an awful specific number, and 25 years is a long time away.Where did the figure come from?The union says the estimate -- based on todays payroll -- is for what the annual savings would be 25 years from now. That is, the amount saved each year, once we are 25 years into the future.Why 25 years in the future?Since contracts allow police officers to retire after 25 years on the job, by that point nearly the entire force would be under the new provisions.(The citys estimate, using that measure is $179 million in savings a year, based on todays payroll. So, the two sides are not far off.)That may seem clear enough.But the wording in the ad -- savings over the next 25 years -- is confusing.We read it as the total amount saved during the course of those 25 years and think most others would as well. That figure is even harder to calculate, since it depends on how many officers retire or leave the force and at what point; how rapidly those officers are replaced and what happens to their salary in the meantime.Indeed, by that measure, the overall savings is likely much higher. The annual savings would grow as the force shifts over time from most being under the current no-contribution system, to most being under the new approach.Of course, the numbers in the short term on this point are stronger.As for the immediate savings in the contract, Crivello said that if new hires paid 7 percent of their base wage toward their pensions, the city would save $432,000 through 2011 (the citys estimate is $462,000, so there is not a big disagreement on this one either).All right, lets tally the estimated savings from the three areas to see if they back up the two major claims in the union ad. Those were the ones in large, bold print: $12 million through 2011 and $184 million over the next 25 years.$12 million through 2011:Savings from a pay freeze are figurative, based on forgoing an assumed pay raise. The citys payroll costs would actually remain flat, so there would be no direct savings to the budget. The reduced training wage would save the city about $2.08 million and pension contributions would save $432,000 -- both according to union estimates.Thats a total of $2.51 million (the citys estimate is $1.55 million). And thats a fraction of the $12 million claimed.So, the first of the ads two claims is wrong.$184 million over the next 25 years:This claim focuses on the pension change. The city doesnt quarrel much with the dollar estimate, which is an annual savings using todays dollars. But its a figure that wouldnt be reached until the entire workforce turns over, perhaps 25 years from now.There would be savings in the interim years, tallying over the intervening 25 years even more than that amount -- but no one knows how much.So, the second claim may actually be low, but it is also off -- potentially way off.One final note.An asterisk at the bottom of the ad says MPA offered the three concessions in exchange for non-monetary and monetary items. In other words, its clear that the union would only make the three concessions if it gets something in return.MPA estimates the monetary items -- including higher life insurance benefits and higher pay for certain officers -- would cost the city less than $1 million per year, Buetow said. The city has not produced a complete estimate, but Hamblin said the union estimate appears reasonable.So, that would further reduce the savings claimed in the MPA ad.Time for the Truth-O-Meter.The Milwaukee Police Association said concessions it offered in contract talks with the City of Milwaukee would save taxpayers $12 million through 2011 and $184 million over the next 25 years. A proposed pay freeze would affect current employees, but wouldnt save the city any money, while changes in training pay and pensions would save money but affect only new hires.The savings through 2011 would be, using union estimates, $2.51 million -- a far cry from $12 million.On the second point, the MPA is correct there would be about $184 million in savings  in the 25th year. But the wording in the ad refers to the savings during that entire time frame. So this number is also off -- apparently by a lot. The MPAs case would actually be stronger if they used a more accurate number, since during the previous 24 years the annual savings would ramp up until it reaches that projected $184 million in year in year 25.We rate the Milwaukee Police Association claim Barely True.", "hrefs": "http://www.milwaukeepoliceassoc.com/"}], "label": "barely-true"}, {"url":
