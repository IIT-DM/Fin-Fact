outside the Freedom From Influence Fund, and that the payments used for vouchers and grants would be reduced if there was not enough money in the fund.", "In any case in which the Commission determines that there are insufficient moneys in the Fund to make payments to participating candidates under this title, moneys shall not be made available from any other source for the purpose of

Both he and Ford agreed to the expenditure limits, meaning they qualified for the $20 million in federal funds. By accepting the money, both candidates were legally barred from raising money for their official campaign committee.On the surface, this supports Carters claim. No presidential candidate raised a dime for a general election campaign between Watergate and Barack Obamas 2008 presidential campaign, said Kenneth A.

FEC data shows that the compliance fund collected more than $58,000 for the general election.Fundraising for down-ballot candidates. Bourne said the Carter campaign, and sometimes Carter himself, also raised money for House, Senate and other candidates. Media coverage backs this up.

The phrase $525 billion tax increase on the middle class flashes on the screen.The commercial offers no further information about what Hinckley is talking about, so we asked the Hinckley campaign for its backup.Campaign manager Patrick Sweeney said the ad refers to the Affordable Care Act, the health care plan often known as Obamacare, which Whitehouse supported. PolitiFact has examined similar claims, including one in which Hinckley declared that the law will add trillions of dollars in debt, a claimwe ruled False.The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the legislation, designed to expand health coverage, will generate $525 billion in revenue. A lower estimate by Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation predicted it will bring in more than $437.8 billion. Sweeney said the ad is using the CBO estimate.But there are a few significant facts the ad doesn't mention.First, that's not money raised over one year. It'sover 10 years, from 2010 through 2019 for legislation that is being gradually phased in. In 2019, annual revenue is expected to have risen to $88.2 billion.Second, most of the money won't be coming from the middle class, as the ad states.For example, a huge chunk of the revenue, $210 billion of the $437.8 billion in the Joint Committee estimate, comes from both a higher Medicare payroll tax to be paid by individuals earning more than $200,000 a year ($250,000 for couples filing jointly) and from a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income if your income is already high.Those take effect in 2013 and are taxes that middle class families will not see.Other taxes aren't geared to the middle class either, although all taxpayers may have to foot the bill indirectly as the extra costs are factored into the goods and services they buy.They include a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers (which will raise an estimated $27 billion); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion); and a fee on health insurance providers ($60.1 billion).In addition, there's the excise tax on indoor tanning services (expected to raise $2.7 billion) and the stricter limit on deducting medical expenses on tax returns, which is expected to raise $15.2 billion. Both will have a more direct effect on the well-tanned or very-ill middle class.One other element of the law that will affect the middle class is the provision of Obamacare known as theindividual mandate. It requires people to pay an annual penalty if they don't buy health insurance. It takes effect in 2014, starting off at a minimum of $95 for an individual and rising to $695 per year in 2016. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld that controversial provision by characterizing it as a tax, not a penalty.Is this a tax/penalty on the middle class?The CBO, the source used by the Hinckley campaign, has estimated that by 2016, 55 percent of the money collected via the individual mandate will come from people with incomes in the top 20 percent, which is a family of four making roughly $120,000 or more.So less than half the money will be coming from middle class Americans.How much money is involved?About $4 billion in 2016.

A fired former employee of Adelsons filed a lawsuit whichalleges that Adelson personally approved of prostitution at propertieshis company owns in Macau, a former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong that now is part of China.PolitiFact Ohio continued:The DCCC release noted that Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, which is backed by House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders. FEC records indicate that Super PAC hasnt spent anything so far.Adelson and his wife, Miriam, also gave more than $60,000 to the Republican counterpart of the DCCC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, during the past election cycle.A spokesman for the Adelsons company, Las Vegas Sands, issued a statement that said Adelson has always maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties and any accusation to the contrary represents a blatant and reprehensible personal attack on Mr. Adelsons character.In a July 9 interview with Forbes magazine,  Adelson said theres not a shred of evidence to back his former employees charges, and says the fact that he and his wife (a physician who specializes in treating addiction)have given millions of dollars to set up clinicsaround the world to treat people with drug addictions (many of them prostitutes) makes the  claims even more preposterous.  Adelson also told the publication that promoting prostitution could cost him his gaming licenses in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau.The DCCC says  Adelson has given $5 million to Speaker (John) Boehners Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, pledged $5 million to Leader (Eric) Cantors Young Guns Network Super PAC, given $70,800 to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), and has committed at least $20 million into Karl Roves American Crossroads.So Adelson has contributed or pledged plenty of money to Republican candidates or committees. Thats clear. But the Chinese prostitution link is another matter.Heres how PolitiFact Ohio put it in their review of the claim against Renacci:Do unproven charges by a disgruntled former Adelson employee coupled with Adelsons generosity to GOP groups that are likely to back Renacci justify the DCCCs claim that foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renaccis Republican majority?We dont think so.Neither do we.As our Ohio colleagues point out, the allegation that Adelson allowed prostitution at the Macau comes from a fired employee. The DCCC takes that claim and says money from prostitution was included in Adelsons campaign contributions to GOP congressional incumbents -- including Duffy.Theres no evidence that Duffy received contributions from Adelson, and he has no control over contributions to groups that support him.The claim that Adelsons donations to these other groups amount to Chinese prostitution money  is dubious enough that inserting the word allegedly cant save it, PolitiFact Ohio wrote in its assessment.That holds no matter what name is inserted into the cut-and-paste news release.You can repeat a claim, but the smell of smoke remains the same.

Charles Rangel after theHouse Ethics Committee chidedRangel for taking a Congressional Black Caucus trip that was improperly funded by corporations.As if John Boccieris voting record isnt troubling enough, the fact that his campaign coffers have been fueled by the fruits of Washingtons culture of corruption raises further questions about his judgement and his ethics, said a March 1, 2010 statement from Renaccis campaign.Similar attacks have been leveled at Renacci since a May 18 article inThe New Republicrevealed thatfederal law enforcement authorities were examining donationsthat Renaccis campaign got from employees of a North Canton direct marketing firm called Suarez Corporation Industries.Federal agents sought contribution records from  the campaigns of Renacci and GOP U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel after theToledo Bladepublished a report about large donations Suarez employees made to the two campaigns.Wealthy political donors sometimes try to skirt limits on the amount they can give campaigns by having other people write checks and reimbursing them. That practice is illegal.The company and its employees deny any wrongdoing, as do the political campaigns. Mandel subsequently returned the money.", "hrefs": "http://ethics.house.gov/sites/ethics.house.gov/files/documents/Carib%20News%20Report%20Vol.%201_0.pdf"}, {"sentence": "But Renacci held on to the cash, pending the investigations outcome, and that has prompted the same sort of attacks as this years election looms that Renacci directed at Boccieri two years ago.Since news broke that over $100,000 in questionable donations to Congressman Jim Renaccis re-election campaign are the focus of a federal investigation, Jim Renacci has yet to do the right thing and return or donate them, says anoticeon the campaign website of Renaccis Democratic election rival, Rep. Betty Sutton of Coply Township, near Akron..Renacci was queried about the controversy at a June 14 town hall meeting in Rocky River. He responded with an attack against Sutton: My opponent, in 2008, had contributions investigated by the federal government.Sutton, he said, kept them for two years until there was a final decision made, and then she returned them.PolitiFact Ohio wasnt aware that the federal government had investigated political contributions that Sutton received, so we asked Renaccis campaign to explain his assertion.Campaign spokesman James Slepian said the congressman misspoke, and that he instead meant to reference a past investigation into Rangel, her campaign donor. Slepian said Renacci accidentally referred to Suttons campaign contributions rather than using the word donor.When he said contributions under investigation in reference to Sutton, what he clearly meant to say was donor under federal investigation, said an email from Slepian. As you know, Jim has issued numerous statements to the press (including The Plain Dealer) that one of Suttons donors was under investigation for two years and that he is following the same course she took by waiting for the outcome of the investigation before deciding whether or not to return the donations. That is what he was trying to communicate.Slepian also blasted Sutton and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House of Representatives Democrats, for stating that Renacci himself is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The DCCC made that claim in aJune 1 press release. PolitiFact Ohio rated that it False after the head of the FBIs Canton office debunked the accusation.Sutton was among dozens of Democratic office holders to whom Rangel donated money. It is true that allegations about Rangel began to surface in 2008, when The New York Times ran a series of articles about Rangel that suggested irregularities.Allegations in those articles includedabuse of  rent-stabilized apartmentsandfailure to report $75,000 in income, as well as hisprotection of a tax loopholethat favored one of his donors. Within a week of theHouse Ethics Committee's Feb. 25, 2010, reporton Rangels improper junket, Suttonannouncedthat she was giving the $7,000 she got from Rangel to charity.Sutton subsequently called on Rangel to resignfrom the House of Representatives.Slepian says Renaccis decision to wait until the FBI probe is complete before deciding whether to get rid of the the Suarez money parallels Suttons decision to wait. But does it?The Rangel conduct under investigation had nothing to do with Sutton or the donations Rangel made to her campaign. The FBIs investigation specifically involves donations made to Renacci.Also, Rangel was being probed by the House Ethics Committee for violating House of Representative rules. The FBI is probing donations to Renacci as potential crimes.And the amounts of money involved are significantly different: $7,000 from Rangel to Suttons campaign; more than $100,000 from Suarez employees to Renaccis campaign. Data compiled by the nonpartisanCenter for Responsive Politics saysSuarez is Renaccis biggest political donor.Regardless, the claim on the Truth-O-Meter is Renaccis statement to the town hall audience that my opponent, in 2008, had contributions investigated by the federal government.PolitiFact Ohio doesnt play gotcha games. To their credit, the folks in the Renacci camp acknowledged he provided incorrect information to the crowd in Rocky River.But to those in attendance, the information they have to go on is what Renacci told them that night. Thats why the comment merits a check from PolitiFact Ohio.On the Truth-O-Meter, Renaccis statement rates False.", "hrefs": "http://www.bettysuttonforcongress.com/CallRenacci"}], "label": "false"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/jun/21/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-ted-cruz-xx/", "title": "Most of Ted Cruzs money comes from Washington, from outside the state of Texas.", "author": "W.

She said neither brother personally contributed any money to Walker.Indeed, neither brother shows up as a donor to Walkers campaign in theMilwaukee Journal Sentinelsearchable databaseof recall contributors.Case closed?Lets dig a little deeper.Wasserman Schultz's evidenceTo back up Wasserman Schultzs statement, Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Ellen Canale cited parts of a June 2012 CBS Newsarticleon contributions benefiting Walker that were linked to the brothers. She cited two figures in the article that add up to a total of $10 million, well above Wasserman Schultzs claim of $8 million.CBS indicated it got at least some of its data from theWisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks money in politics, but it didnt attribute specific figures to the Madison-based nonprofit or to any other source.The article said $3 million was spent on Walkers behalf by the conservative groupAmericans for Prosperity, which wasfoundedby the Koch brothers. How or when the money was spent isnt stated.The article also said Americans for Prosperity spent $7 million in 2011 to promote Walker's agenda, launching an ad campaign just two days after the governor introduced legislation ending collective bargaining for public unions.So, Wasserman Schultz is backing down from her original claim -- that the Koch brothers gave Walker $8 million -- and is now saying the money came from the group the brothers founded.Canale also provided a secondarticle, from FloridasPalm Beach Postin February 2012, in which David Koch said of Walker:We're helping him, as we should. We've gotten pretty good at this over the years. We've spent a lot of money in Wisconsin. We're going to spend more.In saying we, Koch was referring to Americans for Prosperity, the article said.So, clearly theres a close connection between the Koch brothers and the group they created.Examining the evidenceTwo questions arise:1.Are the $3 million and $7 million figures Wasserman Schultz cites in the CBS article accurate?In examining campaign money in the gubernatorial recall campaign, wereportedin late May 2012 that the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign estimated that Americans for Prosperity had spent $2.7 million on Walkers behalf.  The group said it based its estimate primarily on AFP television advertising.We followed up with executive director Mike McCabe about a week after the recall election. He said it's safe to say that Americans for Prosperity in late 2011 and early 2012 spent at least $3 million on Walker's behalf, but that it would be difficult to say how much more.McCabe said he sees no evidence the total would be $10 million, as the CBS article indicated.2.Is it fair to say those amounts were spent by the brothers when the money, as Wasserman Schultz now admits, came from Americans for Prosperity?David Koch himself refers to Americans for Prosperity as we. But as a tax-exempt social welfare organization, AFP does not have to disclose its donors,accordingto the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C. that tracks money in politics on the national level.So, the sources of Americans for Prosperitys money, including how much has been contributed by the Koch brothers, aren't readily available -- although the center noted in a March 2012reportthat AFP's donations included $1.6 million from the John William Pope Foundation in North Carolina and $520,000 from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee.That makes it clear the group gets money from more than just the Kochs.For its part, Americans for Prosperitysayson its website that more than 90,000 Americans in all 50 states have given money to AFP or its sister organization, AFP Foundation.AFP Wisconsin director Luke Hilgemann reiterated to us that AFP doesn't disclose its donors and he noted that the group's ads supported the 2011 state budget reforms, as opposed to a particular candidate or party.The reforms are among Walker's signature accomplishments, although they needed approval from the Republican-controlled Legislature.Our ratingWasserman Schultz said the Koch brothers alone gave twice as much money to Scott Walker as the total amount of money raised by Tom Barrett, which would amount to about $8 million. She later said she meant it was through the conservative organization they founded, Americans for Prosperity, although that qualifier certainly was not part of her original statement.The Koch brothers didnt personally give any money to Walkers campaign. There is no proof of how much Americans for Prosperity, which gets money from the Kochs but also other sources, spent on Walker's behalf. And the leading campaign money tracker in Wisconsin estimates the AFP total as being in the $3 million range.We rate Wasserman Schultz's claim False.", "hrefs": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/guvrace06-ku5ld5b-157364555.html"}, {"sentence": "Update:After this item was published, Brendan Fischer of the Center for Media and Democracy pointed out that a June 2012 CNNarticlesaid Americans for Prosperity had spent $10 million.

The rest of that headline, which was omitted from the ad, stated, despite frosty relations. The article explains that Obama had raised more from the financial and banking sector than Romney but not when putting aside Democratic National Committee money. The ad cites the headline from a February 2012 Bloomberg articleObama returns to NYC for Wall Street fundraiser.That article includes this sentence: So far this election cycle, he hasnt been able to match the success he had four years ago in getting money from Wall Street.Our ruling", "hrefs": "http://americanfuturefund.com/aff-launches-tv-ad-obamas-wall-street"}], "label": "barely-true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/may/20/john-matson/ri-congressional-candidate-john-matson-says-us-rep/", "title": "Jimmy Langevin is having a fundraiser . . . to retire the debt from his campaign for secretary of state, which was 12 years ago.", "author": "C.

(Matson got the date wrong. It was April 30 at Luigi's Restaurant in Johnston.)We called Langevin's office, where spokesman Jonathon Dworkin confirmed that the congressman is still raising money to cover his secretary of state campaign.Here's why.When he first ran for secretary of state, in 1994, Langevin loaned his campaign $280,000. Candidates commonly loan money to their campaigns. He held the office until 2000, when he was elected to Congress.In 2006, Langevin decided to recover his money. He asked some of his congressional colleagues to donate. They did, over five years, giving a total of $63,500.The congressman had a 2006 letter from the Rhode Island Board of Elections' chief auditor at the time, Henry Johnson, saying such contributions were legal.But the board itself, when it learned in 2011 how the contributions were being handled, said Johnson wasn't authorized to make that determination and, more importantly, Johnson was wrong.

Currently, $47,625 remains and payments of $15,875 are due on June 30, Sept. 30 and Dec. 31.

As a proportion, however, it is clear that most of McCains ads were negative in tone.Romneys ad spendingNext, we looked at what Romney has spent on the primary.Several news reports have said the Romney campaign and the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future have spent approximately $15.4 million on TV and radio ads in Florida based on data from Kantar Medias Campaign Media Analysis Group.CMAG would not answer our specific questions about their data since PolitiFact is not one of their clients. We could not find a total dollar figure for how much Romney spent through Jan. 31 on negative ads.However, the president of CMAG, Kenneth Goldstein,told the Daily Beastthat the 2012 primary was the most negative election ad atmosphere I've ever seen.I have absolutely never seen television advertising so negative in a Republican presidential primary, he added.The Daily Beast reported that 92 percent of spending on behalf of Romney was negative.What Wasserman Schultz saidWhatever the final spending tally is for the Romney campaign and pro-Romney super PAC, its clearly much less than John McCain spent in the general election.After PolitiFact Florida questioned the numbers, DNC spokesperson Brad Woodhouse said the press release garbled its talking point.Where it says presidential it should have said primary, he said.Our rulingWasserman Schultz said that Romneys campaign has already spent more on negative ads than John McCain did during his entire presidential run. We couldnt find a precise figure for what Romney spent on negative ads in all the states combined through the end of January, but its clearly much less than what McCain spent on his entire general election run. But it was her dramatic contrast between primary spending and general election spending that caught our attention, and that point is clearly wrong.

The campaign -- like others before it -- uses a narrow definition of lobbyist that allows donations and fundraising by people who most likely look, to the average American, like lobbyists, even if they are not officially. In addition, the Obama campaigns policy doesnt bar even federally registered lobbyists from serving as volunteers for the campaign, as long as they dont give or bundle money.

The investment in Solyndra would not have benefited Mr. Kaiser personally in any way.A handful of other executives affiliated with Solyndra's management and board donated to the Obama campaign or other Democrats over the years, according to theDaily Callerstory. But others didn't reach the level of Kaiser's fundraising  which Stone said could be traced to a single fundraiser at Kaiser's Tulsa home in 2007.Meanwhile, Madrone Partners, which owns more than 10 percent of Solyndra, is an investment vehicle for another family  the Waltons of Walmart fame. Whilesome arguethat Walmart is no longer a conservative company that focuses solely on GOP causes, a search of Federal Election Commission records for contributions from people who list Madrone as an employer still shows most cash benefited GOP recipients. General partner Gregory Penner, for example, a Walton in-law, gave primarily to Republicans, such as $5,000 to the Senate Conservatives Fund, $10,000 to the Republican Party of Kentucky and $10,000 to McCain Victory 2008. He also made smaller contributions to a handful of Democrats such as U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska.House Republicans investigateThe Republican-controlled House Energy and Commerce Committee has been investigating since February 2011 how close ties may have been between Solyndra and the Obama administration. Its Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held hearings in July, September and October, and has been collecting documents and correspondence, including from the White House.So far, the subcommittee's work has generated more than 85,000 pages of documents,according to the White House.", "hrefs": "http://www.americansforprosperity.org/green-energy-scam"}, {"sentence": "The committee members have pointed toe-mails that showthe Obama administration was eager to confirm Solyndra's loan so thepresidentandvice presidentcould tout it as a stimulus success story. Can you confirm whether there are any issues regarding a closing on Sept. 3 for a Sept. 4 VP event on Solyndra? This implies we will need to wrap up our review/approval by Sept. 1, said one Energy Department e-mail from late August.Other e-mail showsthat Steve Mitchell, Argonaut's managing director who also served on Solyndra's board, and Ken Levit, the executive director of the George Kaiser Family Foundation, exchanged messages with George Kaiser about Solyndra and the White House.Kaiser visited Obama's White House at least 16 times to chat about energy policy,according to theDaily CallerandTulsa World, but the foundation told reporters that Solyndra's loan never came up.Spokesman Stone repeated in November: To reaffirm our previous public statements, George Kaiser had no discussions with the government regarding the loan to Solyndra.But messages released by House Republicans on Nov. 9, 2011 include this one from Kaiser to Mitchell, copied to Levit:A couple of weeks ago when Ken and I were visited with a group of administration folks in D.C. who are in charge of the stimulus process (White House, not DOE) and Solyndra came up, every one of them responded simultaneously about their thorough knowledge of the Solyndra story, suggesting it was one of their prime poster children, Kaiser wrote in March 2010.Did they talk about the loan? It's not clear.Meanwhile, in the same batch of e-mails, they discuss that they don't expect to leverage their White House relationships for special treatment.  Mitchell noted to Kaiser and Levit, I think the company is hoping that we have some unnatural relationship that can open bigger doors  I've cautioned them that no one really has those relationships anymore.The path to bankruptcySo did the administration know Solyndra was on the path to bankruptcy?The ad suggests that the Energy Department thought Solyndra would run short on cash as it built its new factory but approved the loan anyway, pointing toe-mail messagesreleased by the House subcommittee. Those messages, written in August 2009 as the department was drafting the final loan terms, got into details about the project's cash balance and working capital requirements. The loan guarantee was formally issued on Sept. 3, 2009.House Democrats respondedto this idea in September, saying that a career agency official who served in the Bush administration had responded to the concern raised on those messages. That official's e-mail, also from August, said that equity investors, who had already pumped over $1 billion into the company, wouldn't let a short-term cash crunch keep Solyndra from finishing its project.And in fact when Solyndra later restructured its Energy Department loan, private investors did throw in $75 million to keep the company on track. (Of course, that's the subject of its own uproar: The terms of the deal put that $75 million loan ahead of taxpayers' investment. House Republicans say that was illegal; Energy Department lawyers had cleared it at the time.)The idea of the loan guarantee program was to push technology from research and development into commercial production  an inherently risky process. Energy Department officials questioned whether Solyndra had the cash to complete its factory project but concluded private investors would continue to bankroll the company. That's rather different from the ad's claim of political favoritism.The sky-high price of high-grade silicon, one of the keys to marketing Solyndra's silicon-free design, dove from almost $1,000 a pound in early 2008 to less than $100 a pound a year later, according to theLos Angeles Times. That left its technology much more expensive than competing flat panels, and paved the way for its struggle to survive. Solyndra argued, theTimesreported, that it just needed time to get its prices down. But it never did catch up.Autumn Hanna of Taxpayers for Common Sense has been highly critical of the loan guarantee program since it started in 2005. She noted the program  backed by both Republicans and Democrats over the years  had too few protections for taxpayers and too little rules governing the decision making. (The Government Accountability Office raised similar concerns in2008and2010.)This was a recipe for fiscal disaster, and Solyndra will likely be just the tip of the iceberg, she said.Our rulingSolyndra's story is unfinished. FBI and congressional investigations continue, and more information about the loan guarantee program may yet come to light.The TV ad says (President Barack Obama gave) half a billion in taxpayer money to help his friends at Solyndra, a business the White House knew was on the path to bankruptcy. Some of this is correct, while some isn't supported by the existing evidence.First, the money wasn't Obama's to give. Solyndra's request predated his administration, and career Energy Department officials handled the deal.Second, e-mails so far don't show an administration pushing through a loan to help Obama's friends at Solyndra. Rather, it appears the administration asked the Energy Department officials to hurry the regular process, so the administration could burnish its stimulus efforts.Third, while e-mails raised doubts about Solyndra's liquidity as the Energy Department finalized the loan, those questions were answered by an official who argued investors would step in to protect the project  red flags, yes. But awareness in the White House the company would dissolve? No.The government wasn't the only blindsided investor  private investors put up far more, and stand to lose more, than taxpayers.", "hrefs": "http://republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/Media/file/Hearings/Oversight/091411/DocumentsEnteredIntoRecord.pdf"}], "label": "barely-true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/oct/17/occupy-wall-street/occupy-wall-street-protesters-sign-says-94-percent/", "title": "94 percent of winning candidates in 2010 had more money than their opponents.", "author": "Louis Jacobson", "posted": "10/17/2011", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["A reader recently sent us alinkto a photograph taken at the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York Citys Zuccotti Park on Oct. 5, 2011.", "It showed a protester holding a sign that said, 94% of winning candidates in 2010 had more money than their opponents.", "Is this Democracy?This statistic has been cited in a number of other forums recently.", "For instance, MSNBC host Dylan Ratigan -- who is backing a petition for aconstitutional amendmentto Get Money Out of politics -- used it on Martin Bashirs MSNBC show on Sept. 27, 2011.", "]Ratigan said there is a single statistic that I think is the only statistic that you need to understand about money and politics in America.", "If you look at campaign for federal office, Congress, president, whatever,  if I know who raised more money, without even knowing anything else, 94 percent of the time I will pick the winner.We took up the readers suggestion to fact-check the statistic.Well first note that the creator of the sign is not specific about what offices are being referred to.", "We found two data sets that directly address the issue, both compiled by nonpartisan groups that track money in politics.", "One is the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks spending patterns in races for U.S. House and Senate seats.", "The other is the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks spending in state legislative contests.In congressional races in 2010, the candidate who spent the most won 85 percent of the House races and 83 percent of the Senate races, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.", "Thats a large percentage, but its lower than what the sign indicated.Indeed, the percentage for 2010 was lower than it had been in recent election cycles.", "The center found that in 2008, the biggest spenders won 93 percent of House races and 86 percent of Senate races.", "In 2006, the top spenders won 94 percent of House races and 73 percent of Senate races.", "And in 2004, 98 percent of House seats went to candidates who spent the most, as did 88 percent of Senate seats.So the protesters sign would have been essentially correct had it not specifically cited 2010 -- though even then, it would only be true for the House and not for the Senate, which has consistently seen lower percentages of the bigger spenders win.Meanwhile, the success rate of big spenders has been lower at the state level.The most recent figures, from the 2008 election cycle, show that 80 percent of state legislative candidates with the monetary advantage won their contests.", "In 2006, it was 83 percent; in 2004, it was 84 percent; and in 2002, it was 82 percent.", "(The groups figures for 2010 are due to be released in the next month or so.", ")So the percentages for state legislative races have also been consistently lower than what the sign indicated.Our rulingThe protester has a point: Even in the relatively atypical year of 2010, a large majority of contests for congressional and state legislative races were won by candidates who spent the most money, and the 94 percent mark was reached in federal races in 2006 and nearly again in 2008.Still, the signs figures were off.", "In 2010 -- which is not only the most recent election year but also the year specifically cited in the sign -- the percentage of big-money winners in U.S. House races was actually 85 percent, or nine points lower.", "And the percentages of U.S. Senate seats and state legislative seats won by the deeper-pocketed candidate have been consistently lower in recent election cycles.", "On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True."], "issues": ["National", "Campaign Finance", "Occupy Wall Street"], "image_data": [], "data": [{"sentence": "A reader recently sent us alinkto a photograph taken at the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York Citys Zuccotti Park on Oct. 5, 2011.

We'll be using this statistic a lot to show Senator Brown's lack of support from people here in Ohio who actually know him and know his record.This brings us to the numbers. We downloaded data from CQMoneyLine, a subscription service that sorts FEC data, and then turned to the original FEC records to do more crunching, factoring in itemized contributions (those of more than $200, which by law must list the donors name and address) and donations from political action committees. The Mandel campaign sent us its numbers, too, and they too came from an FEC download. The numbers matched.They show that Mandel was wrong about the most recent quarter, which ended June 30. Brown got the majority of his contributions from Ohioans: $623,049 in state, compared with $609,506 out of state.The previous quarter, however, more money came to Brown from out of state. Putting the two quarters together, the totals tipped the balance to the out-of-state side: $1,098,899 from Ohio, compared with $1,225,202 from out of state.Does that make Mandel wrong in a narrow sense -- but right in a broader way? His campaign sees it that way.Yet data that includes Browns current term but also goes back to his days in the House of Representatives, crunched on a regular basis by theCenter for Responsive Politicsfor every member of Congress, shows that a majority of Browns donations have always been from Ohio.That could change in the future, as it could for Mandel, who has only raised money during a single quarter so far in  this race (and the majority of his donations were from Ohio). Both candidates must raise millions more. Both will look for deep pockets throughout the United States.But Mandel was wrong on his specific claim. And if adding in one more quarter renders him sort-of right, a long history involving years of Brown elections renders Mandel wrong.On the Truth-O-Meter, Mandels statement is simply False.", "hrefs": "http://www.wkyc.com/news/politics_government/article/204666/131/WKYC-Josh-Mandel-on-publicizing-workers-pay-his-campaign"}], "label": "false"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/aug/28/reince-priebus/republican-national-committee-chairman-reince-prie/", "title": "Public-employee unions spent $30 million in Wisconsin unsuccessfully trying to flip the state Senate to Democratic control.", "author": "Dave Umhoefer", "posted": "08/28/2011", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["In a round of interviews following the Wisconsin Senate recall elections, the Republican Partys national chairman framed the results as a clear victory for Gov.", "Scott Walker.Republicans lost two seats but retained Senate control, despite a major -- and expensive -- effort from Democrats and their supporters.RNC Chairman Reince Priebussaid on MSNBCs The Daily Rundownon Aug. 18, 2011 that the results show Walker shouldnt worry about the left trying to recall him in 2012.", "He argued voters stood with Walker in the face of the challenge by public employee unions outraged over his changes that curtailed collective bargaining for most government workers.And he put a number on the unions effort.I dont think he should be worried at all, and if the public employee unions want to flush another $30 million down the toilet, and then allow Scott Walker to be even stronger and win a recall election  then they should go ahead and do it, because the $30 million they flushed down the toilet will be $30 million they dont have for other races.", "So, hey, go for it.Thirty million -- thats a pile of money.Especially if thats just what unions spent on the races.An RNC spokesman told us Priebus -- the former Wisconsin GOP chairman -- actually was referring not just to labor unions, but to any spending on the pro-Democrat side.Analysis from our political folks in Wisconsin suggests that when all is said and done, pro-Democrat groups will have spent between $20 (million) and $30 million on their failed effort to win a majority in the state Senate, said Ryan Mahoney of the RNC.Of course, Priebus on MSNBC limited his claim to the public unions -- and said a flat $30 million.", "So there are already problems with his claim.Well focus on what Priebus said on MSNBC, but also take a quick look at spending by both sides.Asked for backup for his claim, the RNC sent us dozens of links to media accounts of the disclosed spending in the recalls.Priebus, like reporters, based his arithmetic on what is publicly known about spending in the nine races.", "Thats notable.", "Under state and federal laws, millions of dollars in campaign spending by various political groups goes unreported, but Priebus isnt suggesting he has inside information about that.", "Hes citing the information that is publicly released.That -- and a decision by labor groups to collectively work through a political action committee, We Are Wisconsin, that has to publicly account for its spending -- makes our math easier.A coalition of national, state and local labor groups funded most of the activities ofWe Are Wisconsin.", "The national AFL-CIO was most prominent, followed by various teachers unions;

In particular, if her husband 'oversees the legal entity' but she and her husband and dependents have no personal stake, they need not report it as far as I can see from reading the House ethics manual. As a practical matter, I have seen some people report on the financial disclosures that they oversee assets but point out that they are not their own and that they have no personal stake in them. Most people will report it in the 'Agreements' or 'Positions' section of their disclosure instead of under assets, since thats where it really belongs if you are entrusted with managing someone elses money.Friedly said it's possible that she technically didn't get a penny because the profits may have been treated as retained earnings and invested in things such as new tractors.But the key point here is that while she may not have received a distribution yet, thats because in theory the entire enterprise is more valuable, with more money in the bank account or in farm equipment. She will get it later on. So from her perspective, she hasnt gotten one penny. And even worse than that from her perspective, shes stuck with the tax bill of having to report it on her 1040 Schedule K as a partnership distribution.  And while it may seem unfair to get taxed and not get benefit, presumably over time that money will actually come into her bank account and she wont have to report the distributions.In short, something's not right here. Either Bachmann reported something that didn't need to be disclosed or she got money from the farm at the same time it was benefiting from crop subsidies. Perhaps, as Friedly said, Bachmann won't see her first penny until she draws down the assets of the limited partnership.", "hrefs": "http://foxnewsinsider.com/2011/06/27/michele-bachmann-sizes-up-her-2012-competition/"}], "label": "false"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/jun/24/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/ad-claims-rep-vern-buchanans-old-business-illegall/", "title": "Vern Buchanan.

GOP counterpart Kevin DeWine sparred recently during WCPNs Sound of Ideas radio program in Cleveland.Both are former legislators, young, brash and well-oiled talking-point machines who frequently appear together to defend their respective politics and candidates.Controversial Senate Bill 5, the new law that overhauls the states collective bargaining rules for some 360,000 public employees, drove the discussion at several points on the May 4 program hosted by The Plain Dealers Tipoff columnist, Mike McIntyre.Democrats and labor groups fiercely oppose the law and want to put it before voters in November.", "But a caller to the show who identified himself as a Democrat complained that the party is influenced too much by labor groups.Not so, Redfern said.Over the course of the last six months, for instance, the Ohio Democratic Party has raised $1.1 million since the November election.", "A very small percentage of that has come from organized labor.Given PolitiFact Ohios weakness for a political boast, especially one that includes a statistic  we decided to take a closer look.Redferns reference to the last six months coincides with the current election cycle, which began when the books closed on fundraising for the Nov. 2, 2010, election.PolitiFact Ohio asked for an accounting of the $1.1 million and the union contributions because political donations are not reported publicly in real time and parties typically have several accounts.Party spokesman Seth Bringman said the money was raised this calendar year; that after the November election, fundraising didnt get underway in earnest until after the December holidays.The party raised $383,191 this year for its federal campaign account, which is used when the party promotes a candidate running for federal office, such as the U.S. Senate, Bringman said.", "The Federal Elections Commission requires the party to submit monthly reports on contributions to the federal account.", "PolitiFact checked the partys claims against FEC records and found the figure accurate.The party raised another $477,901 for its state account, as detailed in its pre-primary report filed in April with the Ohio Secretary of State, Bringman said.", "The report shows the party raised $455,281.", "The slight difference is a result of refund and other accounting issues required by the state.", "For the analysis, PolitiFact Ohio is using the figure reported to the state.PolitiFact Ohio verified $858,472 through records.", "Bringman said the remaining money  about $242,000 --will be detailed in forthcoming reports.", "Were taking him at his word, since the figure will be easily verifiable once reports are filed.Next we looked to see what percentage of the money raised came from labor groups.Bringman provided a list of contributions from labor organizations received this year.", "The contributions, which include $25,000 from the Ohio Education Association, total $66,645.That translates to about 6 percent of the total raised this year.PolitiFact Ohio matched these labor donations to the state report.", "Bringman insisted that the forthcoming reports detailing the remaining $140,000 will not show any additional labor-group money.We also evaluated whether the money raised from labor over the last six-month reflects what the Democratic Party typically draws from labor.", "Is the figure an anomaly that works to Redferns advantage in responding to the caller?On the radio program, Redfern went on to say that our support, financially speaking, has been and will always be from individual donors, many of them who make small donations.That comment drew a rebuke from DeWine, who said the amount of money labor groups contributed to Democrats in 2010 is staggering.The GOP chairman produced a spread sheet for us that showed $8.2 million in contributions from labor groups to 2010 Democratic candidates  including those running for the Ohio General Assembly and statewide offices  and to state and county Democratic parties.", "Bringman estimated that together the state party, statewide candidates, General Assembly candidates and county parties raised about $50 million in the 2010.", "The would mean union donations accounted for about 16 percent.", "So where does this leave Redferns statements on the Truth-o-Meter?Campaign figures support his claim that that his party has raised $1.1 million since November.", "Unions contributed a bit under 7 percent of the total, which allows Redfern -- generously speaking -- to claim the its a very small percentage of what it raised so far.One important caveat: The figures presented by both Democrats and the GOP only take into account money given to the Democratic Party and its candidates.", "But that doesnt include any money spent

But was it to the tune of $400 million? We decided to check it out.The ad cited Politico and the Wall Street Journal as its sources, so thats where we went first. Both reported in March 2008 that liberal groups said they hoped to raise $400 million to spend in 2008. About $300 million would come from unions, and the rest from non-union advocacy groups, including MoveOn.org, ACORN and Emilys List.So the part attributed to unions was $300 million, not $400 million. We also noticed that both theWall Street JournalandPoliticorepeated the number in other news stories without attributing the information to a specific source.

Keep in mind, the most detailed reports mentioned the number as a goal, not an amount that had already been raised.Our attempts at independent confirmation were difficult, because unions do not have to report all of their campaign spending to the Federal Election Commission, according to independent campaign finance experts. The unions do have to report direct contributions to candidates and parties and some of their independent expenditures. But they do not have to report internal communications to membership, and they dont have to report get-out-the-vote efforts, even if the efforts are focused on heavily Democratic areas.We contacted the staff at the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan organization that tracks campaign spending. They told us that it would be impossible to account for all union spending during the 2008 cycle; the law doesnt require that level of disclosure.But in the data required to be reported, the center found $75 million in direct contributions from unions and union members to candidates and parties, of which over $68 million went to Democrats. It also found $86 million in outside spending by labor in the 2008 cycle, which largely benefited Democrats. It also identified an additional $52.7 million in spending from labor groups  in 527 organizations, tax exempt organizations that seek to influence elections. Add it up, and you get $206.7 million.The $400 million discussed in March might have been aspirational and not actually achieved, said Eric S. Heberlig, a political scientist who studies the labor movement at the University of  North Carolina Charlotte.

Public disclosures showed he raised$745 million, compared with John McCains $368 million.The RNC said the unions spent $400 million to elect Obama. We do want to acknowledge that independent publications have reported that number to be the case. But when we looked into the sources for that number, we found that it was the unions themselves discussing what they hoped to raise in the 2008 election. Furthermore, the reports said they wanted to raise $300 million, not $400 million, and it was a goal, not something they had yet achieved. When we looked at the public disclosures after the election, we found the unions reported $206.7 million in spending for all Democrats. It's clear that the unions raised additional money for get-out-the-vote activities, but we don't know how much more -- nor does the RNC. Finally, all that money went to support Obama and other Democrats, not just Obama alone. In short, we don't see the evidence to support that unions spent $400 million to elect Obama.

Dongivin said he wasn't the only Scott campaign worker to be paid in gift cards and not a check or cash.The TV report went on to cite an unnamed spokesperson, something we won't do at PolitiFact Florida, who acknowledged some campaign workers were paid in gift cards, and that anyone who had a problem with the arrangement could return the cards for a check.That's the background. Now for the details.In the Republican primary, the Scott campaign used its own campaign account to pay for its staff. But after the primary, payroll responsibilities switched to the Republican Party of Florida. It's standard practice, in part because the party can receive larger campaign contributions than an individual candidate.Scott spokesman Brian Burgess directed us to the party to answer questions about how staffers were paid. They 'fessed up. Like many other campaigns, gift cards were distributed to short-term Scott field staff almost exclusively for the final 72-hour field efforts, Republican Party of Florida spokesman Dan Conston said. It's a simpler and quicker way of compensating short-term help.Conston said a Scott campaign representative and someone from the party would approve the spending, but did not say who. Neither Conston nor Burgess said how many temporary campaign workers were paid in gift cards. Full-time staffers were paid by check, Conston said.", "hrefs": "http://www.wtsp.com/video/default.aspx?bctid=665062375001"}, {"sentence": "Two other notes from Conston: He said the gift cards were only used in the last week of the campaign, and that because of service fees, the campaign actually paid above face value.In Dongivin's case, he was a temporary worker hired to drive out voters on Election Day. Typically, it's a responsibility many people might associate with a volunteer -- and many campaigns use volunteers in the same way. Dongivin was paid $178 on Oct. 15, according to Republican Party of Florida campaign finance records. He also likely received a second payment on Oct. 31, 2010 -- though those records are not yet public.We reached out to more than 20 people across the state who worked with the Scott campaign to see how they were paid. Most didn't respond to our messages, but those that did say they were paid in checks, just like every other employee they knew.Michael Fluno worked out of the Tampa office of Scott's campaign until shortly after the primary and said he was always paid in checks. While Fluno was working on the campaign, he said, he knows, for a fact, that no one was paid with any kind of gift card.Same goes for Dean Palecheck, of Orlando, who worked on the campaign during both the primary and general election.When asked how he was paid, Palecheck said: Paid by check, like any normal employee there.What's interesting here is that it's not new for campaigns to use gift cards to pay part-time, temporary workers. In fact, President Barack Obama's campaigndid the same thing in 2008. A TV station in Indianapolis reported that last-minute workers for Obama's 2008 campaign were paid $30 Visa gift cards for three-hour shifts of work. The temporary workers complained to the TV station that they were not being paid fairly.Which brings us back to Maddow. On her nationally televised cable program, the liberal commentator picked up on a local TV news report and claimed Scott paid his campaign staffers, not with money, but with American Express gift cards. While she's right that Dongivin, and other temporary workers, were paid with gift cards and not cash, we think her comments are a bit misleading to the average viewer.", "hrefs": "https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:pKSa5Y49RP0J:www.wthr.com/story/9299280/obama-campaign-unpaid-wages-resolved"}], "label": "half-true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2010/nov/10/friends-voter-owned-elections/portlands-voter-owned-elections-failed-because-vot/", "title": "Its hard to get people in Portland to vote yes on ballot measures, especially when theres opposition.", "author": "Janie Har", "posted": "11/10/2010", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["In 2005, the Portland City Council approved a campaign finance program to give candidates public money to run for office.", "It was supposed to get big money out of politics and let candidates focus on talking to voters, not raising campaign cash.", "It was considered very progressive and very Portland, and city commissioners said they would put the issue to voters in 2010.", "Last week, those voters rejected it by a slim margin.Heather Stuart, spokeswoman for the Yes on 26-108 campaign, issued a statement the day after the election, expressing disappointment over the results.", "She said the other side had distorted the financial cost of the program, and she said that the campaign had suffered from the bad economy.Stuart also wrote this: Historical data shows that it is always more difficult to get a yes vote, especially in the face of organized opposition.The reporters at PolitiFact Oregon have been in the game long enough to know that, indeed, voters statewide tend to say no when the proposal on the ballot is confusing, is controversial or costs money.", "But Stuarts implication that statewide skepticism played a role in sinking a campaign-funding measure solely in Portland is suspect.Portland isn't like the rest of Oregon.", "Portland, which exists mostly in Multnomah County -- with teeny bits in Washington and Clackamas counties -- likes to say yes.We have backup from Pat McCormick, a veteran of ballot measure battles, most recently on the losing side over tax-raising Measures 66 and 67.", "He was hard-pressed to think of a spending plan that Portland didn't like.", "You have to do quite a bit to get to a 'no' on a money measure in this city, he said.Want more evidence?", "Lets take a stroll through the votes of Multnomah County.", "(Well use this because elections usually are conducted by counties, and Portland is the most dominant city in Multnomah County.", "Where appropriate, well cite Portland-only measures.", ")November 2010: County voters approved four of six statewide ballots measures, and five of seven county measures.", "County voters even approved the unpopular TriMet levy that failed because of opposition in Washington and Clackamas counties.", "And, finally, Portland voters werent afraid to embrace a property tax levy for new fire trucks and other emergency equipment.January 2010: Voters approved two statewide tax measures -- 66 and 67 -- by more than 70 percent.November 2008: County voters approved all three property tax levies on the ballot.", "They were for the Oregon Zoo, Portland Community College and childrens programs.November 2007: Voted yes on a statewide land-use rewrite, yes on a statewide tobacco tax that went down elsewhere;

The letter contains this line: No wonder Kurts opponent has said he supports allowing corporations to secretly funnel millions of dollars to front groups to finance attack ads.Secretly funnel millions? Front groups? Attack ads? It all sounded so very Dr. Evil. PolitiFact Oregon was all over it.Bruun, in line with most other Republicans, supports the U.S. Supreme Courts 5-4 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (January 2010). The ruling loosened restrictions, allowing corporations and unions to spend as much money as they want directly from their treasuries to support or oppose a candidate. Before, donations had to come from employees or union members through a political action committee. Also before the ruling, corporations couldnt spend any money on campaign ads -- the ones that urge a vote for or against a candidate -- within 60 days of a general election.In general, Democrats call the Citizens United ruling a slap to grass-roots democracy.Republicans, who get lots of contributions from corporate interests, say there should be no limits on speech. (The majority held that First Amendment protections should apply to corporations as well.)Asked for evidence that Bruun ever said such a thing, the Merkley campaign offered his response to a question about the Citizens United decision from theLeague of Women Voters of Oregon guide: Free speech is messy, noisy and uncomfortable for some. Of course the alternative to free speech is much worse. Political speech is the most important form of speech for a free, open and tolerant society. The Supreme Court has ruled and Congress should leave it alone.Nothing there about secret millions or front groups. In fact, Bruun never said any such thing. But we wanted to know if the sentiment behind Merkleys statement was accurate.In other words, is it fair to say that you favor secret donations to front groups to pay for attack ads if you think Congress should leave Citizens United alone?Citizens United expanded the amount of money allowed and how it can be used, but it was the final nail in a bout of hammering. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court started allowing corporate money into elections by letting groups, including corporations, spend money to run issue advocacy commercials. The decision in Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life struck down a portion of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law.And lets not discount the roles of federal tax law and federal enforcement of elections communications in allowing donations to remain secret. First, the IRS tax code allows 501(c) nonprofit groups to shield donor names even as it allows politically minded nonprofits to engage in political speech. (To compare, political groups identified under IRS tax code 527 must disclose regularly.) Second, the FEC requires disclosure only of corporate money earmarked for electioneering -- which few companies do.Its true theres been much more money dumped into elections this year, with a lot less disclosure. A Washington Post analysis found that less than half of the total third-party spending this election was disclosed with donors identities.Nothing is greater than the Citizens United decision in opening the floodgates, said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen. The nonprofit consumer advocacy group,  based in D.C., has urged Congress to pass a disclosure law to fix the ruling.In fact, a host of nonpartisan groups interested in open government called for the same. The national League of Women Voters issued a call earlier this month for television stations to reject ads paid for with secret money.Marge Easley, president of the League of Women Voters of Oregon, wanted to make clear that the nonpartisan group favors neither candidate in the 5th District. But she added that if a candidate is not in favor of disclosure of campaign funding, then that means they are in favor of keeping things secret.So is Bruun in favor of secrecy or disclosure when it comes to campaign spending? Significantly, Bruun does oppose the Disclose Act, which would have required groups to name donors behind commercial ads.Bruuns campaign spokeswoman Alee Lockman wrote in e-mails that Bruun supports transparency & reporting in campaign finance but disagrees with the way the Disclose Act is set up.He is, of course, open to bipartisan discussions about campaign finance regulations, but as he is not

attracting lobbyist support.", "Up to his win, Birdwell drew donations from a single Austin political action committee, according to his campaign finance reports.", "From March through June, less than $11,200, 7 percent of his total contributions, came from four Austin donors, counting two PACs.Has the rookie senator flip-flopped on taking donations from lobbyists?Birdwell was unavailable for an

Texas which, Birdwell's statement says, resulted in significant legal bills.Birdwell didn't volunteer the names of new lobbyist donors, but his statement says he's happy to to have the support of groups in Austin who didn't originally back my candidacy.", "Birdwell's statement also says his campaign is having a number of fund-raisers across his district, though he has no expectation of recouping through donations the personal loans he made to his campaign.Birdwell's latest contribution and expenditure report doesn't show any outstanding loans.", "However, his campaign finance

opponents to one of the primary bogeymen for the countrys economic recession.The Ohio Democratic Party uses this tactic in a web ad focused on former U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, the Republican candidate for Ohio attorney general, even going so far as to call him a lap dog for Wall Street.", "The ODP attack rolls everything bad about Wall Street into one big ball

legislation that helped Bernie Madoff make millions.", "He protected predatory lenders while families lost their homes.PolitiFact Ohio decided to dig into these claims that paint DeWine as a pawn of the Wall Street elite.The most straightforward one is that DeWine took $1.9 million from big banks.ODP officials say its easy to get $1.9 million.", "Just add up DeWines career fundraising totals on Open secrets.org  the handy federal fundraising tracker from the independent Center for Responsive Politics  as well as more than $62,000 raised in the current AGs race.While the math checks out, you can get to the $1.9 million figure only by adding in money not only from commercial banks ($595,677) but also securities and investment firms ($726,375), miscellaneous financial institutions ($348,548) as well as finance and credit card companies ($237,750).The big bank claim need a pretty big tent to fit all of the qualifying financial institutions in its shade.Meanwhile, the ODP claim that DeWine helped Madoff make millions can be traced to three yes votes the Republican cast in 1995 for a bill known as the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.DeWine joined 48 Republicans and 20 Democrats in the Senate.", "The legislation raised the burden of proof lawyers in private practice would have to show in cases of corporate fraud.That means that DeWines vote was helping Madoff make millions because it handcuffed private attorneys from pursuing claims as concerns surfaced as early as 1999 that Madoff was operating a Ponzi scheme, the ODP argues in an e-mail.Even if thats true  and its certainly open to debate  the timing of the concerns about Madoffs operation dont square with the timeline as presented by the Ohio Democratic Party.In a 477-page report issued in 2009, SEC Inspector General David Kotz found that substantive complaints against Madoff were filed as far back as 1992  three years before DeWine voted to overhaul the law.That reports states that a total of three examinations and two investigations were conducted by SEC officials but that a thorough and competent investigation or examination was never performed.Most incredibly, SEC officials even failed to take the most basic of steps to check up on Madoff.", "At no time did the SEC ever verify Madoffs trading through an independent third-party, and in fact, never actually conducted a Ponzi scheme examination or investigation of Madoff, states Kotzs report.Madoff himself called it astonishing that the check wasnt done.", "They never even looked at my stock records, he told Kotz for his report, according to a December 2009 story in the New York Daily News.", "It would have been easy for them to see.", "If youre looking at a Ponzi scheme, its the first thing you do.Clearly, the overriding reason that Madoff went undetected for so long is because the federal officials supposed to watch over him dropped the ball again and again.Is it possible that a private attorney could have brought forward an investigation that brought Madoff to justice if the law hadnt been changed in 1995?", "Yes, it is possible, but its far from a sure thing, especially considering that the old law was in place for three years after initial concerns surfaced about Madoff.Besides, the law change doesnt seem to quite equal helping make Madoff money, even if you conclude he would have been caught earlier if the old law had been in place.Lastly, the ODP accuses DeWine of helping to protect predatory lenders while families lost their homes.That charge references a pair of 2001 tabling votes that DeWine made during the debate over the Bankruptcy Reform Act, which never became law because the differences between the House and Senate versions were never reconciled.At that time, DeWine, 48 other Republicans and 15 Democrats blocked an amendment requiring that credit card companies disclose more information to consumers and giving stiffer penalties for predatory lenders.", "The other amendment that DeWine tried unsuccessfully to table prevented predatory lenders who violated the Truth in Lending Act from filing for bankruptcy to dodge claims.Those votes were at a time when the Ohio Democratic Party says families lost their homes in a reference to the foreclosure crisis that has walloped the state, including a record-high 89,053 foreclosure cases in 2009.However, Ohio Supreme Court statistics on foreclosures show only 43,419 in 2001.So while certainly some families were among those who lost their homes in 2001, the foreclosure numbers were about half the record-breaking foreclosure numbers that have hit the state in recent years with upwards of 80,000 a year since 2007.", "By then, DeWine wasnt even a senator.Add it up, and the scorecard for the Ohio Democratic Party

Democratic candidates, Providence Mayor David Cicilline has built by far the biggest war chest, which has -- not surprisingly -- made him the biggest target.", "Every day, it seems, one of Cicilline's opponents is firing a shot at him.Following a showdown at the first Democratic debate, one of the challengers in the race, former party chairman Bill Lynch, released a statement accusing Cicilline of hypocrisy regarding the way political campaigns are funded.The gist of his attack: while Cicilline stressed during the debate that we will not fix Washington and what's broken in Washington until we break the connection between money and politics ..., he was accepting campaign contributions that did just the opposite.", "In fact, the second-quarter campaign finance reports were released just a few days after the appearance.Mayor Cicilline wants the voters to believe he's concerned about the way campaigns are funded, yet he continues to accept hundreds of thousands of dollars in lobbyist, corporate PAC and insider money to fund his campaign, Lynch said in his statement.From the outset, we knew this would be a challenging claim to check, yet also a useful one for readers.", "The Lynch campaign -- though vocal in their attacks -- went silent when we asked them for a list of these lobbyists, corporate PACs and insiders.", "Their rationale: it is not appropriate to discuss individual Cicilline donors.But Lynch is making a serious accusation against an opponent.", "The burden of proof is on him.", "And a refusal to back up a claim doesn't buy you a pass on PolitiFact.So we elected to look at Cicilline's first- and second-quarter 2010 federal campaign finance filings, those filed since he declared his congressional candidacy in February.", "Since Lynch used the phrase continues to accept, hundreds of thousands of dollars, it seemed appropriate to examine the most current reports.Because Lynch would not define what he meant by insider money, we decided to focus on donations from lobbyists and corporate PACs.Cicilline received $1.16 million in the first and second quarters from more than 750 donors, more than half of whom gave $1,000 or more.", "That included donations he was able to transfer from his mayoral campaigns.", "Of that, roughly $44,000 came from Rhode Island and federal lobbyists.How did we arrive at that number?First, we took the contribution lists and cross-referenced them with the secretary of state's list of 2010 registered Rhode Island lobbyists.That tally came to about $41,500, including donations we could definitively attribute to registered lobbyists and people we could identify as the lobbyists' immediate family.", "We acknowledge that there may be others, but we only included the ones we could confirm.Next we contacted the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics in Washington.", "The group compiles lists of contributions made by a variety of groups including Washington lobbyists.", "According to their data, Cicilline received $2,400 in donations from federal lobbyists during the first quarter.", "The center has not yet completed its second-quarter calculations.Together the donations by state and federal lobbyists totaled around $44,000, or just under 4 percent of his total contributions.Lynch also said that Cicilline received contributions from corporate PACs.", "Our review showed that of the almost $35,000 Cicilline accepted from Political Action Committees this year, only about $6,000 or so came from so-called corporate PACs, which we defined as a political committee directly associated with a corporate entity, such as a law firm.", "We did not include those affiliated with ideological causes such as the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, which also gave to Cicilline.Add the lobbyist and corporate PAC contributions and you get just under $50,000.", "That's roughly 4.3 percent of the $1.16 million he accepted this year.", "It's hardly the hundreds of thousands of dollars that Lynch talks about.But remember, that tally doesn't include the third group that Lynch rails against, the insider[s].", "Cicilline's first- and second-quarter filings clearly show he is accepting money from many well-known Rhode Island political and business leaders.", "These are, after all, the types of people who generally donate to candidates.The more recent filing also shows he received contributions from donors as varied as Family Guy creator -- and RISD graduate -- Seth MacFarlane, Patriots owner Bob Kraft and Boston event planner, Bryan Rafanelli, a Warwick native who has been mentioned lately in news reports as reportedly overseeing former first daughter Chelsea Clinton's nuptials.Does Cicilline, who stressed the need to break the connection between money and politics, accept money from lobbyists, PACs and insiders?", "Yes.", "But Lynch's unwillingness to define what he means by insider, makes it impossible to do an exact calculation.", "And based on the limited information we have now, his insistence that Cicilline continues to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars can't be verified.Now let's take a look at Lynch's first- and second-quarter federal filings.", "They reveal that of the almost $186,000 he accepted in contributions from about 160 donors (he also loaned himself $100,000), approximately $7,500 of it came from lobbyists, with all but $1,000 from Rhode Island lobbyists.It does not appear that he took any money from so-called corporate PACS, though he did receive several union contributions.", "Add it all up and the sum of donations Lynch accepted from lobbyists equals about 4 percent of the total contributions he received.Cicilline's pockets may be far deeper than Lynch's, but the percentage of donations each of them received from these groups is roughly the same: 4 percent.", "(And by the way, it's clear that Lynch took money from well-known business and political leaders, the so-called insider money, that he criticizes Cicilline for accepting).In the end, Lynch

TheWasington Post'sRight Nowblog reported that Barton said: It is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown, in this case a $20 billion shakedown.Later the same day, Barton apologized for his apology after Republican leaders threatened to take away his committee leadership position.TheTampa Tribunereported June 25 that West about a week earlier had also raised concerns about the BP escrow account at a business luncheon in Palm Beach Gardens. West said that while he was 'angry with BP' for the spill, 'when you have an executive branch that goes to a private sector business and takes their private equity funds and demands that they put it into an escrow account, something is upside down in this country. That is a very dangerous precedent that we establish.'

It's green. It's real green. It's big money and influence. Just so you know what's coming down, Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu received almost $1.8 million from BP over the last decade.That's quite a bit of cash, so we decided to look into the claim.It turns out that the $1.8 million figure has been one of Schultz's regular talking points.On May 6, Schultz criticized Landrieu for defending the oil industry while small businesses in the region could be wiped out by the disaster.We have interviewed people on this program in recent days that are on the verge of not only losing their family business of 80 years, their clientele right now, and wiping out the whole industry, yet you are concerned about the liability limits on big insurance and oil? he said. Sen. Landrieu, youre really looking out for people, aren't you? Or is it just that $1.8 million worth of money to your campaign speaking right now from BP?And on May 11, 2010, Schultz said, We should point out that Senator Landrieu has taken $1.8 million from BP over the last 10 years, shortly after an interview with Landrieu ended.We checked that figure against data fromOpenSecrets.org, a website that tracks campaign contributions. Between 2000 and 2009, BP employees and the company's political action committee contributed $25,200 to Landrieu. And since Landrieu was elected to Congress in 1996, BP employees and the company's political action committee have given her a total of $28,200. (So far, Landrieu hasn't received any money from the company's workers or PAC in 2010, so we excluded that year from our analysis.)To put those campaign contributions to Landrieu in perspective, the company's employees and action committee have donated a total of $4,734,181 to all federal candidates since 1996, when Landrieu's congressional career began. That means that during her entire time in the Senate, Landrieu's only gotten about 0.6 percent of BP's action committee and employees' total contributions.Both figures are a far cry from the $1.8 million Schultz claimed on his show.Alana Russo, Schultz's spokeswoman, said that the original figure came from a May 4 CNN story; the news organization has since corrected the error. She also pointed out that Schultz issued his own correction on May 12.In recent days we have been reporting on this program on two different occasions that Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana had taken $1.8 million from BP, he said. I want to come off the top tonight and correct that number. It is $752,000... I want all of you to know our apologies from me, Ed Schultz, on this. I dont like getting my numbers wrong.But Schultz did get the numbers wrong - again.Indeed, Landrieu has received $752,744 fromallthe oil and gas industry's political action committees and employees -- not just BP -- during herentirecareer. Schultz initially said that Landrieu had received $1.8 million from BP in the last decade, so his correction is an apples-to-oranges comparison. (We should also note that OpenSecrets is in the middle of updating some of its information; according to the organization, the most up-to-date figure is actually $758,744. But that number is available only on some parts of the OpenSecrets site.)Furthermore, he said that he'd reported the $1.8 million figure twice on his show. But we found that he mentioned the statistic three times.Russo told us Schultz is planning to issue an additional correction on his May 14 show.So how to rate it on the Truth-O-Meter? Given Schultz's incorrect correction, we won't wait for a new one. He repeatedly claimed that Landrieu had made $1.8 million from BP employees and PAC in campaign contributions over the last decade. We found that she's only made $25,200 from them in that period of time. That's a huge difference. Schultz eventually issued a correction, saying that Landrieu's only gotten $752,000. But Landrieu has received about that much during herentire careerfrom theentire oil and gas industry,not just BP's political action committee and employees.
