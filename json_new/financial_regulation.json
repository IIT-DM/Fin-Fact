history.", "Using optimistic imagery and themes to argue that the country was on the right track after the crises of the 1970s, the ad set the tone for Reagans landslide reelection victory.", "By contrast, the Lincoln Projects ad, retitled Mourning in America, is replete with depressing footage of masked Americans and economic devastation.", "And it directly blames Trump for acting ineffectively on the health and economic fronts.", "At one point, the ad asserts, Trump bailed out Wall Street, but not Main Street.", "Trumptweetedhis displeasure with the ad, ironically producing

for a Responsible Federal Budget, has been tracking the federal response to the coronavirus-driven economic downturn.", "He said the dichotomy in the ad is wrong.", "The coronavirus relief legislation passed so far, Goldwein said, generally bails out everyone.", "We should start by noting that Trump wouldnt be solely at fault for any design flaws in the primary law for coronavirus relief, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act.", "The $2.2 trillion act, which Trump signed into law on March 27, 2020, included stimulus payments to most Americans, enhanced unemployment aid, loans for small businesses, and other relief measures.", "However, before it got to Trumps desk, the bill had the support of both parties.", "It passed the Senate unanimously, and it passed the House overwhelmingly.", "The primary way the bill helps small companies is through thePaycheck Protection Program.", "Under that program, small businesses can take out federally backed loans through banks or credit unions to tide them through the coronavirus pandemic.", "The government will forgive the loans if the company keeps all of their employees on the payroll for eight weeks, and as long as the money is used for payroll, rent, mortgage interest, or utilities.", "The Paycheck Protection Programattracted negative media attentionwhen some larger employers, such as Shake Shack, secured small business loans.", "Criticism grew as the program ran out of money allocated under the CARES Act.", "Congress later provided funds for additional loans.", "The Shake Shack loan appears to have been legal, since the program allowed loans for businesses in the food services sector that have more than one physical location and employ less than 500 people per location.", "Still, the negative attention led some of these businesses, including Shake Shack, to voluntarily give back their loans.", "The Small Business Administration, which is overseeing the program, has produced somebroad breakdownsof how the first $342 billion in loan money was spent.", "For assessing the ads claim, the most problematic cut of the SBA data concerns the size of the loans made so far.", "The breakdown shows that slightly more than 74% of the individual loans granted were for $150,000 or less, totaling $58 billion.", "Because most companies apply for the maximum amount allowable, and because the loans are capped at 10 weeks of payroll costs, a loan of this size is consistent with a company that has roughly seven to 10 workers, Goldwein said.", "(Because the individual loan amounts in this category were small, the sum of all these loans was equal to only 17% of the total money spent.)", "Further evidence that the loans are reaching smaller companies comes from asurvey released May 5by the National Federation of Independent Business, a leading small-business group.", "This survey found that 77% of the groups small business-owner members have successfully submitted an application, and about 61% of those applicants had already received their loans.", "Others were still in process.", "So contrary to what the ad argues, tens of billions of dollars are flowing to small businesses.", "The publics aversion to rescuing Wall Street dates back to the Great Recession in 2008, which, unlike the coronavirus downturn, was sparked by a meltdown specifically of the financial sector.", "The first big bill to address it, theTroubled Asset Relief Program, was designed primarily to help ailing banks, credit markets, and other financial institutions.", "Another early action was to rescue the government-chartered home mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.", "This initial legislation bailed out the financial services sector, rather than economically stressed ordinary Americans.", "Since then, complaints about lawmakers favoring Wall Street have  persisted for more than a decade, from the Occupy Wall Street movement to Sen. Bernie Sanders insurgent presidential campaigns.", "As recently as a few months ago, Sanders, in his second presidential bid, wasregularly assailingfederal assistance to Wall Street firms.", "The Paycheck Protection Program does not put any special emphasis on aiding financial firms, although most of the big Wall Street players would be too big to qualify.", "In addition, after the bill was passed, regulations were implemented tobarprivate equity firms from benefiting from the program.", "If a financial company is small enough, from community banks or credit unions to insurance broker firms, it could qualify for a loan under the program.", "In fact, the SBA data shows that the finance and insurance sector received 2.39% of the dollars loaned under the program.", "Still, thats well down the list of sectors being served by loans.", "The biggest recipients were companies in construction (13.12%), professional, scientific, and technical services (12.65%), manufacturing (11.96%), and health care and social assistance (11.65%).", "Another way banks and credit unions can benefit from the Paycheck Protection Program is by servicing the programs loans to small businesses.", "When lenders make a loan under the program, the government pays them a fee.", "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budgetestimatesthat the total administrative costs of the first $349 billion loan tranche was $7.6 billion.", "Much of that probably went to financial institutions, some of them big players of the kind critics have targeted.", "However, its worth noting that this was not a bailout but rather a fee for services rendered.", "Probably the closest the relief legislation has come to a bailout of Wall Street comes from a separate part of the law, and its impact has been indirect.", "The CARES Actprovidesthe Federal Reserve with$454 billion in emergency lending authority.", "This isdesignedto provide liquidity to the financial system to aid eligible businesses, states and municipalities.", "So while much of this aid will flow through banks, it was not created with bailing out Wall Street as its endpoint;

fraud is concealing the fact of that noncompliance.", "They are different legal categories.", "But the boundary between the two categories is often hazy.", "Last year, a firm owned by Foxconn subsidiary FIH mobile in Hebei provinces Langfang city tried to stop the Chinese environment ministry's pollution inspectors from making checks during a nationwide investigation of more than 3,000 companies.", "Does this constitute violating environmental laws or environmental fraud?", "According to Tai, it could be both, because most operating permits require a company to allow inspectors

Mortgage Lending !", "!", "The video has attracted more than 22,000 views.", "At the town hall, Clinton was responding to an audience member who asked how she planned to help Hispanics who want to buy or keep their house, particularly in Nevada, a state hit hard by the Great Recession.", "Among Clintons suggestions was to provide more help so that more homeowners, Hispanic homeowners, African-American homeowners, those who want to have access to better credit, and better support.", "You know, credit has tightened up in ways that are just not fair.", "You are three times more likely to be able to get a mortgage if you're a white applicant than if you're black or Hispanic, even if you have the same credentials and you're presenting it to the people who are looking at it.", "Clinton was essentially saying that mortgage lenders were engaging in significant racial and ethnic discrimination that cant be explained by other factors, such as income or credit history.", "Thats a serious allegation, so we decided to take a closer look.", "After checking with the Clinton campaign, we learned that she misspoke at the Las Vegas event.", "As evidence, they pointed to several other speeches in which Clinton had used a more accurate version of the statistic.", "For instance, after winning the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 20, she said, We see African-American families denied mortgages at nearly three times the rate of white families.", "She made similar comments at a Democratic dinner in Minnesota on Feb. 12 and interview with the BET network on Feb. 17.", "So where did these numbers come from?", "Studies released by the real estate website Zillow inFebruary2015andNovember 2015.", "The Zillow study The study looked at federal data on mortgages.", "The2013 datashowed a denial rate for conventional loans of 10.4 percent for whites, 21.9 percent for Hispanics and 27.6 percent for African-Americans.", "The2014 datashowed somewhat lower denial rates across the board  9.4 percent for whites, 18.8 percent for Hispanics, and 23.5 percent for African-Americans.", "These numbers pose a few problems with Clintons statement.", "For starters, these are denial rates, not acceptance rates, which was the metric Clinton used in her town hall comment.", "The acceptance rates for 2013 work out to 89.6 percent for whites, 78.1 percent for Hispanics and 72.4 percent for African-Americans, and using those numbers -- or the ones for 2014 -- her ratios dont work.", "If you do use rejection rates, it was 2.7 times higher for African-Americans in 2013 and 2.1 times higher for Hispanics -- reasonably close to what Clinton said, though not a perfect fit.", "A bigger problem for Clinton, however, is that she said even if you have the same credentials, even though this study did not equalize for income, credit history or other factors before calculating those percentages.", "Indeed, Zillow made a point of noting in the study of 2013 data that while the playing field remains strikingly unequal in mortgage loans by race and ethnicity, differences in loan denial rates stem at least in part from income and geographical disparities between the three groups.", "The disparity in loan approvals is likely tied to a number of factors, including income, Zillow said.", "Specifically, wrote Zillow Chief Economist Stan Humphries, black and Hispanic applicants for conventional home loans make roughly $20,000 less per year than white applicants, resulting in much higher denial rates.", "Similarly, black and Hispanic communities are clustered in areas that saw huge run-ups in home values prior to the recession, and even larger drops during the crash.", "Experts we contacted agreed with Zillow that differences by race and ethnicity can, and do, play a role in mortgage denials.", "Still, they said the scope of the racial and ethnic gap is hard to nail down, and is probably a lot lower than Clinton suggests.", "Andrew Hanson, a Marquette University economist, cautioned that income and credit scores are just two of the factors that could be contributing to the racial gap.", "Other, harder-to-quantify factors such as wealth and market experience can magnify existing biases as well.", "Hanson said he has conducted a smaller-scale study in which participants contact loan originators with basic inquiries.", "He then analyzed the loan originators offerings to measure any differences by race.", "The result?", "The size of the discrimination effect was about 2 percent.", "Hanson said theres another caveat when gauging racial and ethnic discrimination: Much loan underwriting today is done electronically.", "The deny-or-accept decision isnt left up to a person these days, he said.", "Information is basically given to a computer and the computer decides if the loan should be made.", "That is not to say that humans do not make decisions along the way, but a human rarely has the final say on loan approval/denial.", "Our ruling Clinton said, You are three times more likely to be able to get a mortgage if you're a white applicant than if you're black or Hispanic, even if you have the same credentials.", "The Clinton campaign admits she misspoke.", "While there is evidence of disparities in mortgage acceptance rates by race, Clinton flubbed a talking point she has used correctly on other occasions.", "Experts say the gaps are not as drastic as Clinton says once you equalize for other key factors, such as income and credit history.", "We rate her statement False."], "issues": ["National", "Financial Regulation",

General Motors, hit deep financial problems.", "But the rest of the claim, ascribing blame to political favoritism and Obama administration backroom deals, was not supported by facts.", "We based the

post-bankruptcy, restructured company.", "There were others in the auto industry also in trouble, including Delphi.", "And GM and Delphi were the corporate equivalent of step brothers, if not blood relatives.", "Delphi was a division of GM until the parts maker was spun off as an independent company in 1999.", "Before the spinoff, Delphi maintained separate pension funds for its unionized and non-unionized workforces.", "The non-unionized workers were salaried, many in white-collar or support jobs, and their pension fund was flush.", "The union pension fund, however, was not.", "In other cases, this might have meant that the unionized workers would eventually get smaller pensions than planned.", "But in this case, GM made a deal that kept the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, or UAW, happy, which helped facilitate the Delphi spinoff.", "The deal was this: GM would make up, or top-up, the difference between the underfunded pension payments and the amounts the workers would have gotten if their pension fund were in fine health.", "This was not just benevolence.", "By agreeing to the top-up, GM was able to hand off Delphi operations without union opposition and keep its outside supply chain running.", "And so the parties codified the top-up provision and kept it in force.", "But a decade later, the twin bankruptcies of GM and Delphi created a wrinkle.", "GM had the right in bankruptcy to void its contracts.", "That could have meant the end to the top-up agreement.", "It so happened that by now, the fortunes of Delphis nonunion workforce and retirees had turned.", "The once-full pension fund for non-union, or salaried, retirees was underfunded as well.", "But unlike their unionized colleagues, the salaried or non-unionized retirees had no top-up deal.", "So what would happen?", "Two things: First, the Obama administration would agree to bail out General Motors and give it money to keep operating.", "But before the final sign-off,  the administration through its Treasury Department-appointed auto task force would need to review GMs obligations and make decisions about what and whether it owed Delphi retirees.", "Bankruptcies typically involve many parties being told to accept the fact that they are never going to get every penny they are owed.", "Yet thats not what happened in the case of the Delphi unionized-worker pensions.", "GM, with considerable help from the Treasury auto team, agreed that even as it exited bankruptcy as a new organization, it would continue to top-up the UAW pensions from its parts supplier.", "It also agreed to continue top-ups for the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, and the United Steelworkers of America.", "But GM and Treasurys auto team left the salaried retiree pensions alone.", "The non-union retirees would get no top-up.", "As a result, those retirees would only collect 30 percent to 70 percent of their expected pensions, which would be paid by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., or PBGC, the federal agency that takes over failing pension plans.", "Was this fair?", "Turner and other lawmakers from auto states said no, as did Delphi retirees.", "They said that despite the pre-existing top-up agreements, GMs bankruptcy gave the automaker the right to rewrite the top-up contracts, just as it rewrote a number of unrelated terms with the unions consent.", "Even better, they said, GM and Treasury could have worked out a way to make all Delphi retirees whole.", "But that didnt happen.", "There were winners (the union) and losers (the non-union retirees), and that looked like political favoritism and backroom dealing to Turner and other critics.", "But in 2012, congressional testimony and GAO reports led PolitiFact Ohio to conclude that Treasury and GM made the decision because: (a) the union had long-standing top-up agreements and salaried retirees did not, and (b) any attempt to end those agreements would have caused the UAW to balk or even strike.", "Treasury maintained that it was vital to get GM stabilized quickly, and an interruption to its ability to get parts for its cars -- due to labor unrest -- could be fatal.", "There was nothing to back up Turners claim that the top-up decision was made because of political favoritism and backroom dealing.", "The GAO said that court filings and statements from GM and Treasury officials support that Treasury deferred to GMs business judgment.", "Based on this, PolitiFact Ohio gave Turners claim a Mostly False rating.", "Thats where matters stood until Aug. 15, when additional information was released though the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP.", "The Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, provided federal funds for bank bailouts as well as the auto rescue, and was overseen by Treasury.", "The report by the special inspector general, an independent watchdog, provided a long-awaited assessment of Treasurys role in the pension controversy.", "The SIGTARP report confirmed much of what the GAO already said.", "It reported that GM and Treasury were concerned about getting the automaker back on its feet quickly -- and that, in the words of Steven Rattner, head of the auto team, trying to get more on pensions was a game of chicken we didnt want to play.", "We were under incredible time pressure.", "Why, then, upgrade PolitiFact Ohios rating?", "The SIGTARP report contained new information about the dominant role that Treasurys auto team played.", "The teams role in the decision to top-up the pensions of UAW workers was not just advisory, the SIGTARP report said.", "Treasurys financial role gave it a dominant position.", "GM could not make decisions without Treasury.", "GMs chief financial officer at the time, Ray Young, told SIGTARP that Treasurys influence, a result of its financial stake, was such that GM put forward recommendations, but at the end of the day (Treasury) makes the final decision.", "This was all done privately.", "Those with leverage, particularly Treasury and the UAW, were able to make their demands.", "Delphis salaried retirees, who believed the government could make them whole, had no leverage and were largely kept on the outside.", "That is a clear impression from the SIGTARP report.",

We found a good primer on this subjectposted by Howard Gleckman, editor of TaxVox, a blog from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.Lets also quickly address terminology.Arecent itemfrom our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin was helpful here. They note that, as defined by the National Academy of Public Administration, outsourcing is the contracting out of services domestically or internationally. When a company shifts service and manufacturing activities abroad to unaffiliated firms or their own affiliates, thats called off shoring.

Such a system would lift U.S. taxes on foreign profits, meaning that a multinational corporation would not have to pay taxes on overseas earnings it repatriates.Renacci voted in favor of the Republican budget and against the Democratic alternative, offered as an amendment to Ryans proposal. The Democratic plan failed in the Republican-controlled House. Ryans budget was later blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.DeAngelo also pointed to Renaccis vote in favor of the Simpler, Fairer Tax Code Act of 2012. This also would have moved the U.S. toward territorial taxation. The bill passed the House in August on a largely party-line vote but has not been taken up by the Senate.Proponents of territorial taxation, including Renacci, argue that it would level the playing field with other countries and encourage repatriation. Opponents worry that the system will make it even more enticing for U.S. companies to move jobs overseas. Gleckman legitimized these fears, noting that such a shift might encourage some domestic companies to move more of their operations -- and shift both jobs and more reported income -- to low tax countries.PolitiFact Wisconsin weighed in on a similar claim by AFSCME.

The $33.8 billion difference between the repayments and the total cash collected has come through interest, dividends and other revenue sources.These numbers differ slightly from those reported by ProPublica, a Pulitzer-winning investigative group, which tracks the federal figures on itsBailout Tracker.ProPublica, which categorizes the payments differently, reports that banks havereturned $223.9 billion, which, along with $31.9 billion collected in interest other revenues, has left the government with a $19.6 billion gain.But, the point is the same, noted Paul Kiel, who authors the Bailout Tracker.Essentially, the treasury has realized a profit on the bank portion of the TARP investments, Kiel wrote last week in an email message.Those profits could rise even higher. The treasury, which purchased stock from 707 banks, still holds investments in about 280 of them. But, if we expand the definition, as ProPublica does, to include investment agencies and credit card companies, among other financial institutions, more than 400 companies still have debts outstanding with the government, Kiel wrote in a Septemberblog post.Most of these banks, however, are small institutions who are struggling to stay afloat, Kiel wrote. Of the 400-plus, 162 have fallen behind on their dividend payments to the treasury, he wrote, and, according to a March report by theU.S. Government Accountability Office, 130 banks were included on the governments list of problem banks, demonstrating financial, operational, or managerial weaknesses that threatened their continued financial viability.While repayments, dividends, and interest from institutions participating ... have exceeded the programs original investment disbursements, the number of missed payments has increased over the life of the program, government officials wrote in theGAO report. Institutions that continue to miss payments and problem institutions may have difficulty ever fully repaying their  investments.Our ruling:Not all of the banks who received TARP money have repaid the loans. In fact, 400-plus banks are still on the governments red list -- more than have completed the payments -- and, according to the GAO, some may never pay the money back.But, the fact remains, due to interest, dividends and other revenue streams, the government has received more money back ($266.7 billion, according to the Treasury) than it handed out to banks under the bailout law ($245.2 billion).

consumer fireworks in 1976, issued its annual fireworks report last week.", "It confirmed the injury number Weimer used -- 8,600 for 2010.CPSC spokeswoman Nikki Fleming said the injury rate as

fireworks themselves are safer?We asked Weimer what he had to support his statement.", "He immediately credited the work of the CPSC and the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory.In the 1970s, the

performance.In 1988, the CPSC started an inspection and enforcement program for Chinese-manufactured fireworks.", "China -- which now supplies 98 percent of the fireworks in the United States -- began exporting fireworks to this country in 1973.Initially, 75 percent of fireworks tested  by the CPSC failed to comply with the regulations.The quality truly wasn't very good, Weimer said.", "The quality was inconsistent.", "The industry knew that if it didn't so something there would be big issues.Working with the CPSC, importers established the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory to set additional, stricter requirements for consumer fireworks.", "The AFSL went to factories in China, conducted seminars, worked with manufacturers and started a testing program in China in 1994.The linchpin of the system is the testing, Weimer said.The testing is conducted by an independent laboratory hired from outside China by the AFSL.", "Each fireworks shipment is tested for compliance with 15 quality standards, Weimer said.", "If any standard is not met by any of the randomly selected cases, the entire case lot fails.In the program's first year, 1994, 36 percent of the random lots of tested fireworks were rejected.", "By 2002, that number was less than 10 percent.", "The compliance rate exceeded 90 percent.CPSC Chairman Inez Tenenbaum, speaking at a symposium in China last January, noted that the agency has been working for years with manufacturers and with China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine.While AQSIQ and CPSC may work to improve product safety with somewhat different motivations, everyone benefits from the end result, which is improved product safety, she said, adding that we have increased the frequency, scope, and depth of our training in China.Weimer thinks that the availability of regulated consumer fireworks diminishes the use of the really lethal illegal and homemade variety.So what's the grand finale?PolitiFact Ohio is not ruling on the advisability of maintaining, relaxing or tightening Ohio laws regulating fireworks.", "And were not taking a position on whether consumer use of fireworks is even a good idea.Weimers statement addressed legal and proper use of fireworks by consumers -- not use of homemade or illegal products.", "And fireworks are -- as Weimer told us -- a product with

You cannot have a free economy and free market if there is not a financial system.  The TARP program was designed to keep the financial system going, to keep money circulating in the economy, without which the entire economy stops and you would really have an economic collapse.

So action had to be taken. Was it perfect? No. Was it well implemented? No, not particularly. Were there some institutions that should not have been bailed out? Absolutely.

Heres an excerpt:Despite unleashing havoc on the global economy, Wall Street is once again getting ready to pay astronomical bonuses this year. The nations six largest banks alone are on track to pay their bankers a staggering $143 billion in bonuses, benefits and compensation (bonus and compensation), more than enough to fill the $130 billion total budget gap for all 50 states in (fiscal year) 2011. If Wall Street pumped this money directly into the economy instead of paying it to its bankers, it could create 3.6 million new jobs, and lower the unemployment rate by 2.3 percent. Bank of America tops the list, with $35 billion in bonuses and compensation set aside for its bankers.At the end of the report, the authors added an appendix titled Potential Job Creation by Bank.The appendix said, See below to see how many good-paying jobs with benefits big banks could create if they spent their bonus on job creation instead of banker bonuses. In a footnote, the authors added that the figures are based on a cost of $40,000 per job, although they don't say why $40,000 was chosen.The figure listed for Bank of America? Exactly 878,300 jobs -- essentially the result you get if you divide $35.1 billion by $40,000.But theres a problem. We were confused by the reports use of the words bonus and compensation, since the Facebook post (and the SEIU appendix) referred only to bonuses.It turns out that the $35.1 billion figure is not simply bankers bonuses -- its all compensation paid by the company (encompassing salaries, benefits and bonuses) to every employee of Bank of America. That means it includes all compensation paid to executives, tellers, janitors and anyone else you can imagine who works for BofA.The $35.1 billion figure can be found in table 5 on page 27 of the2011 Bank of America annual report. We confirmed with a company spokesman as well as two outside experts that noninterest expense for personnel -- which is how the annual report labels the $35.1 billion figure -- means salaries, benefits and bonuses for everyone employed worldwide at Bank of America.Knowing all this, we can calculate how many jobs $35.1 billion in compensation actually created. Its 288,000 -- the current number of employees at Bank of America.What if you just looked at bonuses alone? How many $40,000 jobs could you get from just by divvying up the companys bonus pool?The company doesnt officially release its bonus data, but we did find aBloomberg news reportthat estimated that Bank of America paid its investment banking employees about $4.4 billion in bonuses for 2009, citing a person close to the bank.Dividing this bonus pool into $40,000 increments gets you 110,000 jobs, far less than the 878,300 claimed in the Facebook post, though its quite a bit more than the 10,000 people the investment-banking unit actually employs -- many of whom probably earn more than $40,000.Our rulingThe Facebook post -- and the SEIU report it was almost certainly based on -- incorrectly said that a pot of money consisted of bonuses when it in fact included all forms of compensation for all employees at the company.

Glossaries likeInvestopediadefine GSEs as (p)rivately held corporations with public purposes created by the U.S. Congress to reduce the cost of capital for certain borrowing sectors of the economy.When the White House submits its annual budget, it includes the GSEs, and the list isnt long.  There are the Agricultural Credit Bank and Farm Credit Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. And thats it. No electric co-ops. No credit unions.The2012White Housebudgetexplains that Congress chartered Freddie Mac in 1970 to facilitate the flow of investment dollars from the capital markets to mortgage lenders and ultimately, to homebuyers.A credit union or an electric co-op is created completely differently. They come into being when a group of local investors pool their money. The countrysveryfirst creditunionwas started in 1908 by a priest in Manchester, N.H., to provide credit to factory workers in textile mills.  Washington played no role at all.Later, the federal government offered both funding assistance and regulatory guidelines. Local co-ops and credit unions need to apply to a government agency for recognition as a nonprofit, member-owed entities.  And thats another difference. Freddie Mac is owned by stockholders. Co-ops are owned by members, the people who use them. Levine, with the NRECA, says electric co-ops started in the 1930s when farmers would each throw $5 into the hat and then ask Washington for a loan for a transformer or some power lines.Back then, and today, those loans would come with a very low interest rate, but Freddie Mac was treated even more favorably. It was formed with a direct line of credit from the federal Treasury for more than $2 billion. They could borrow money cheaper than anyone except Uncle Sam himself, said Kathleen Day, a former Washington Post reporter who covered GSEs for over two decades.The deal for Freddie Mac got even better. Thanks to that intimate association with the federal government, Day says the markets perceived them as something that was backed by Washington and invested at a very low cost ... Thats what allowed it to grow.Our rulingGingrich spoke of credit unions and electric cooperatives as if they were the same sort of entities as Freddie Mac. We find no support for that and do find major differences in how they are created and operate compared with GSEs.

No way!Since the financial crisis began in 2008 -- not 2007, senator -- federal officials have held numerous public hearings and passed a financial reform law, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.While high-profile executives on Wall Street have not faced criminal charges, federal officials have prosecuted cases against other individuals for financial crimes before and during the time of the economic collapse.Doherty told us his claims are supported by a Dec. 4 segment on 60 Minutes on CBS, which stated there has not been a single prosecution of a high-ranking Wall Street executive or major financial firm.In an email, Doherty also responded to our charge about the Dodd-Frank Act: Regarding reform, there has been no reform.", "If there was

what PolitiFact New Jersey found:Its true that prominent Wall Street executives have not been prosecuted, according to various news reports.", "But its wrong for Doherty to say nobody has.For example,

nominations (including three times rejecting Tyler's nominee for Secretary of the Treasury).", "Those instances involved major disagreements between Congress and the president over policy (Tyler vetoed the main provisions of the Whig party's agenda, and Johnson and Congress fell out over Reconstruction policy), but they did not involve a blanket blocking of nominees to a particular agency.Ritchie sent that email to Browns office at 12:52 p.m. Several hours later, he followed up with another email to Browns chief of staff: Mark, the Senate Library has been hunting for precedents, and found the attached controversy over the Legal Services Corporation in the 1980s that involved a letter signed by a majority of senators against three of the president's nominees.", "The issue there was whether the nominees would support the spirit of the law, rather than requesting that the law be rewritten, so it's not exactly the same.This was in reference to a period in 1982 when the White House tried to weaken the Legal Services Corporation by nominating board members with conservative views of how far the government should extend its hand.", "The Legal Services Corporation helps pay for civil lawyers to serve the poor, and President Ronald Reagan and a bipartisan majority in the Senate were at odds over three of Reagans most conservative nominees, according to Congress and the Nation, a historical volume.Jousting over Reagans nominees continued for several years, but as Ritchie said, the issue was whether the nominees would support the spirit of the law.To better understand this distinction, its important to know that in the case of Cordray, 44 of the Senates 46 Republicans made clear in a letter before the Ohioan was even nominated that they would not accept any nominee unless the brand-new agencys structure was changed.", "Theirs was a blanket blockade.Was their goal to weaken the agency?", "Brown and other Democrats say so.", "That, too, was the goal of Reagan with the Legal Services Corporation.", "But there are two differences between the Reagan matter and the current case.The Senate in the 1980s was not trying to use the confirmation process to change the architecture of the agency.", "Rather, Reagan was trying to use his appointments to change how aggressively or weakly the agency did its job.", "The agency, established in 1974, was already operating.The other difference?", "Reagan, the president, was the one interested in slowing down the agency.", "The Senate, on the other hand, wanted the agency to keep operating as usual.Cordrays case is the opposite.", "President Barack Obama supported the agencys creation and wants it to get to work.", "But under the Dodd-Frank legislation it cannot write and enforce rules affecting payday lenders, private student loan providers, debt collectors, non-bank mortgage servicers or credit agencies until it has a director.Senate Republicans say they will not confirm any director unless the agencys oversight structure is changed.", "Lacking a majority, they failed to win those changes in the Dodd-Frank legislation, but they have sufficient numbers under procedural rules to halt confirmations.This isnt a question of which side is morally or politically correct.But based on the record, including its nuance, we take the Senate historians word: Brown was correct when he said

Community banks have experienced 30 to 40 percent decreases in their assessments. For many community banks, Dodd-Frank has not been all that bad, he said.In a letter marking the one-year anniversary of Dodd-Frank, ICBAs President Camden Fine also praised the law for making inroads in supervising the mega-banks and putting non-bank financial firms, which can range from insurance companies to hedge funds, under more of a regulatory microscope.ICBA is not head-over-heels in love with the financial reforms. It doesnt like the limits the new law puts on the fees banks can charge each time a customer uses a debit card.  Initially, the rate was capped at 12 cents per swipe.Regulators later changed that to 21 cents.If there is one overarching fear that smaller banks have with Dodd-Frank, it is the prospect of new regulations. We are expecting compliance costs to increase dramatically, Rose Oswald Poels, president of the Wisconsin Bankers Association,told the Milwaukee BizTimesThe president of the American Bankers Association, Frank Keating, warned in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece of a mountainous regulatory burden that will overwhelm small banks.Federal regulators have issued 4,870 Federal Register pages of proposed or final rules affecting banks,  Keating wrote. Many more are still to comefor a grand total of more than 240 rules.What Keating fails to mention is that many of the rules under Dodd-Frank specifically exempt community banks.A lot of the stuff in Dodd-Frank is really meant to be targeted at the big guys, not the small ones, said Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at George Washington University Law School who testifies regularly on Capitol Hill on banking issues. Wilmarth said many more rules could exempt smaller banks depending on how they are written. The ultimate decision on debit card fees is a good example. Not only did regulators raise the allowable fee, the law exempted all banks with assets under $10 billion from the new rule.The ICBA's Cole makes a larger point -- that one should hold judgment on the new law. The implementation of Dodd-Frank is just halfway through, he said. Its too early to say what it is.  Cole said so far, regulators have been very responsive. Theyve been willing to listen and reach out to us.A major goal of lobbyists for community banks was to pass a law that treated small banks differently from large ones, and the ICBA  says they achieved that in Dodd-Frank. One sign of this divide: when the ICBA -- representing small banks -- and the ABA -- representing banks both large and small --  listed their lobbying priorities for 2011, there was virtually no overlap.The ABA for example wants to change the oversight of derivatives, but small banks rarely touch derivatives trading. And the two organizations totally part ways on deposit insurance. The ABA wants to trim back the Dodd-Frank changes, while the ICBA members want to keep the savings they gained from the law.Wilmarth and others criticized Dodd-Frank for not going far enough to deal with banks that are to big to fail, but, in most ways, it is tougher on the big banks than it is on the small ones, they said.Our Ruling:Gingrich said that community banks are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank. But as a whole they are healthier than a year ago. No doubt the improvement in the economy has helped, but community banks also have benefited from a reduction in fees paid to the FDIC as a result of Dodd-Frank.From the point of view of community banks, Dodd-Frank is imperfect and still unfolding. But it has exempted community banks from many new regulations. That said, the shape of the rules to come will make a big difference in its final impact on them.To say that this industry is being destroyed by Dodd-Frank is untrue and unlikely to be true in the future if regulators continue to respond to the concerns of small banks. We rate Gingrich's statement False.", "hrefs": "http://www2.fdic.gov/qbp/2011jun/qbp.pdf"}, {"sentence": "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1ce81073-8a07-4eda-83a2-70e02ed776fe", "hrefs":

Obama & the federal govt could learn a few things from FL &@FLGovScottFL's credit rating was recently upgraded to AAA.Same for Scott's official campaign Twitter feed@ScottForFlorida, which sent this message: RT@FreedomsMob: USA downgraded by S&P, Florida upgraded to AAA by S&Phttp://t.co/F2qa5XK.The link takes people to an interview between Scott and CNBC host Larry Kudlow. While the U.S. had its own debt downgraded, the Sunshine State of Florida (got) upgraded by S&P, Kudlow said before introducing Scott.Did Florida's credit rating go up, while the United States' credit rating went down?Standard & Poor's is a New York-based ratings agency that studies the financial markets. It issues guidance to investors and rates various investments for financial risk. That includes investments in public debt, such as bonds issued by the state of Florida.S&P spokesman Olayinka Fadahunsi told us that Florida has held S&P's AAA rating since February 2005. That means the agency considers Florida to have extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments.It's also the highest rating the agency gives.So how could Florida's rating have been upgraded?It wasn't, Fadahunsi said.Here's what happened: In January 2009, the agency changed its outlook on Florida debt. An outlook is an evaluation of the likely direction of a rating over six months to two years. In 2009, S&P's outlook on Florida's rating dropped from stable, which means that a rating isn't likely to change, to negative, which means that a rating may be lowered.In July 2011, as the United States was having its rating issues, things reversed course in Florida. S&Prevised its outlook for Florida from negative back to stable (registration required to see report)based on the latest budget passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature and signed by Gov. Rick Scott.The outlook revision reflects our view of the progress the state has made in addressing its structural imbalance through significant cost-cutting measures adopted in fiscal 2012 and maintenance of strong reserves, said Standard & Poor's credit analyst John Sugden-Castillo.The outlook change did not affect Florida's AAA rating.We also asked S&P spokesman Fadahunsi whether the agency considers a change in outlook a credit upgrade.We don't consider outlook changes upgrades or downgrades, he said.State Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater put it best in an Aug. 9, 2011,interview with theSt. Petersburg Times. Florida was AAA before the downgrade, it's AAA today, and in fact the rating agencies just upgraded our longer term outlook, Atwater said.Part of the problem with this myth is that the media has at times perpetuated it. On Aug. 16, for instance, theWall Street Journalpublished an opinion piece headlined Upgrading the States.It began:Ohio and Florida get plenty of attention as Presidential election swing states, but this year they deserve notice for another reason. While Uncle Sam was having its debt downgraded, Ohio and Florida both got upgrades from Standard & Poor's in July as a result of their improved fiscal management.After more detail about Ohio, it added:Ditto for Florida, which won a AAA rating after closing a budget hole with what S&P said were 'significant cost-cutting measures' and making a commitment to maintaining strong reserves. Governor Rick Scott's 2012 budget was praised for 'significant measures' to address its budget deficit and for being 'proactive in reducing expenditures to adjust for revenue shortfalls.'We also found this Aug. 16 report fromWOKV radio in Jacksonville.

back money lent to it by the American government, with interest, six years ahead of schedule.President Barack Obama, who is expected to highlight the milestone in a visit to a Toledo, Ohio, Chrysler plant on June 3,called the repaymenta significant milestone for the turnaround of Chrysler and the countless communities and families who rely on the American auto industry. He and other Democrats adopted an I-told-you-so stance, with some Democrats taking the opportunity to remind the public that many Republicans opposed the auto bailouts.In apress releasefrom Chrysler Group LLC announcing the loan repayment, the company's Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne stated, Less than two years ago, we made a commitment to repay the U.S. and Canadian taxpayers in full, and today we made good on that promise.For this item, we're going to focus on whether the company repaid U.S. taxpayers.", "hrefs": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/24/statement-president-obama-chrysler-s-repayment"}, {"sentence": "Chrysler Group LLC repaid $5.1 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) loans and formally terminated its ability to draw from a remaining $2.1 billion line of credit extended through TARP. Together with interest and fees, Chrysler Group has now paid $6.5 billion to the U.S. Treasury. It borrowed $5.1 billion from the U.S. government when it began operations under new ownership in June 2009. In addition, the U.S. Treasury still holds a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group.So is Chrysler now really square with the American taxpayer?The press release doesn't mention it, but there's more to the government's investment in Chrysler than the loans to Chrysler Group LLC.In its ownpress releaseabout Chrysler's loan repayment, the U.S. Department of Treasury lays out a more complete picture of taxpayer support of Chrysler:Treasury committed a total of $12.5 billion to Chrysler under TARPs Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP), the release states. With todays transaction, Chrysler has returned more than $10.6 billion of that amount to taxpayers through principal repayments, interest, and cancelled commitments.  Treasury continues to hold a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler. As previously stated, however, Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler.In an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on May 24, 2011, Ron Bloom, assistant to President Obama in charge of manufacturing policy, broke it down more plainly:Today, Chrysler is reducing their obligation to the U.S. taxpayer by $8 billion. They have previously provided us with $2.6 billion of funds. So, that $10.6 (billion) stacks up against $8.5 billion that the president invested in Chrysler and $4 billion from the prior administration. So, that's over 100 percent of all monies that this administration invested and about 85 percent of the total invested funds by the United States government.So how can the Chrysler Group LLC claim to have squared its obligation to the American taxpayers when only 85 percent of the taxpayers' investment in Chrysler has been recouped?Notice how we keep writing Chrysler Group LLC. There's a reason for that. That's the new Chrysler company that emerged from bankruptcy in 2009.We'll let Gualberto Ranieri, head of communications for the Chrysler Group LLC, explain.Ranieri likened the generic use of the word Chrysler to a fruit salad, which is made up of lots of different fruits: apples, strawberries, blueberries...you get the idea. When you talk about Chrysler, there's not just one company. There's the old Chrysler, the company that was liquidated in bankruptcy. There's the new Chrysler, aka Chrysler Group LLC, the newly formed company that purchased most of the assets of Old Chrysler in a bankruptcy sale. There's also the financing firms Chrysler Financial and GMAC.We are not responsible for the old Chrysler, Ranieri said. We are not responsible for Chrysler Financial. I am not responsible for my brother's loans, even though we have the same last name.Chrysler Group CEO Marchionne can only speak for the new company, Ranieri said, and the government money extended to Chrysler Group has been fully repaid, with interest.That's technically true, Edward Niedermeyer, editor-in-chief of The Truth About Cars websitewrote this week. It does, however, fail to account (again) for the $1.9 billion Debtor-in-Possession 'loan' which financed Chrysler during bankruptcy and was conveniently left to die with the remains of 'Old Chrysler.' Nor does it account for the $1.5 billion loaned to Chryslers suppliers to keep them afloat amidst the bailout chaos.Chrysler and its political bedfellows should be forgiven for a little cheering, Niedermeyer wrote. The loan repayment is a positive sign of hope for a once seemingly doomed company.Its just that taxpayers still deserve a full and transparent accounting of 'every penny' (to borrow a phrase) that actually went into Chrysler, not just 'loans made in the last two years' or 'loans made by the Obama Administration' or other weasel-wordings employed to make the bailout seem more successful than it is, Niedermeyer wrote. Though bailout supporters will doubtless argue that 'it doesnt matter' because Chrysler is alive today and 'thats what matters,' this doesnt justify a lack of transparency. In fact, if the bailout was successful because GM and Chrysler survived, thats all the more reason to not fear the truth about what the bailout actually cost.James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said there was nearly $2 billion in taxpayer money that went down with the ship with the old shell of Chrysler. Technically, he said, Chrysler Group LLC is a different company. But from a taxpayers' perspective, there's little distinction.If the taxpayers were a bank, they wouldn't stay in business very long, he said. The taxpayers took a loss, or they are still in the red at least.Now, the U.S. Treasury still owns a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group. That has an undetermined value, as the company has not yet gone public. But as the Treasury itself acknowledged, Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler.We asked Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University what he made of Marchionne's statement.This certainly appears to be another instance of careful language, where all of Chrysler's statement is focused on loans to Chrysler but not the other Treasury investments, White said.  Yes, this appears to be an incomplete statement.As we noted earlier, the statements made by Marchionne were similar to those made by General Motors CEO Ed Whitacre last year. But the situations are different. For one, the government took a much larger equity stake in GM. For more details, see ourfact-checkrelated to Whitacre's claims last year.Again, there may be cause for celebratory comments from Chrysler. But Marchionne's statement, while technically accurate, doesn't tell the full story. Yes, Chrysler Group LLC has fully repaid the loans made to it two years ago. But that's not the full measure of the American taxpayers' investments to try to save Chrysler, including $2 billion to old Chrysler that was wiped out in bankruptcy.

We would urge the SEC to implement this provision with extreme care.Do these types of comparisons make any difference? We turned to Graef Crystal, an expert in executive compensation and a frequent critic of CEO pay, for his views. These numbers get thrown around a lot by people to prove whatever, he said. Some CEOs might be surprised by the numbers, he said, but generally what matters most to executives and those who set their pay is how they compare to their peers, he said. They dont look down, and they dont look across at China.In fact, he said, as proxy statements disclose details about pay that may now be opaque, it could ratchet up pay.He also noted that there is a significant correlation between sales volume and the pay of CEOs.

It is made up of 500 firms which have market capitalization (number of shares multiplied by stock price) of $10 million or more. In contrast there are nearly 6,000 publicly traded firms on the nations two largest stock exchanges. So comparing the compensation of CEOs at only the select companies in the S&P 500 to the pay for all nonsupervisory production workers is not an apples-to-apples comparison.Turning back to the bumper sticker, is it true that corporate executives earn 431 times as much as the average worker? Not any more, since the most recent study in the same series found the figure in 2009 was 263 times the average worker pay. But, having gone through the pain of removing outdated bumper stickers ourselves, well allow a little leeway for the figures lack of currency. And, leaving aside the question of whether it is warranted or not, there is still a sizable gap between corporate executive pay and worker pay, although probably not as large as the gap between S&P 500 CEOs and the average of all nonsupervisory production workers, some of whom work at much smaller companies.

Barry Pfitzner, a professor of economics at Randolph-Macon College.Pfitzner noted that the U.S. is no longer on the gold standard, which ended in 1914.", "Even the gold exchange standard -- under which official holders of dollars like foreign banks and treasuries could convert dollar holdings to gold -- ended in 1971.The current market gold price is nothing more than the equivalent of any other speculative commodity.", "Not unlike, say, silver, diamonds, platinum -- or for that matter, hog futures, Pfitzner said.", "So one could argue that the dollar has lost 98 percent of its power to purchase gold.", "So what?", "Irrelevant.", "And the Fed is not to blame.", "It does not control the price of gold.Dean Croushore, chair of the economic department in University of Richmonds Robins School of Business, agreed.Economists generally think of purchasing power as the amount of goods that a person can buy with a dollar, not the amount of gold that a person can buy with a dollar, he said.", "Measuring the amount of goods that one can buy with a dollar is best done using a price index, such as the consumer price index.Well, thats easy enough.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, a dollar in 1913 had the same buying power as $22.09 today, about a 95 percent decline.Rather than the gold standard, the BLS calculator uses the average Consumer Price Index for a given calendar year.", "That data represents changes in prices of all goods and services purchased for consumption by urban households.Now, on to the next point.", "Is the Fed really responsible for the dollar's decline in value over 90-plus years?That is not a great record and the blame does belong with the Federal Reserve, especially in the high inflation years from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, Croushore said.", "He added that the Feds record improved in the past 20 years, when the average annual inflation rate has been 2.5 percent.Pfitzner noted two problems with putting all the blame on the Fed: the change in what money is used for and the difference in incomes.No economist would argue that the index from 1913 is comparable to the index in 2010, Pfitzner said.", "The mix of goods that consumers purchase is entirely different.As to his second point, the annual income per person today is about $33,000 today, compared to about $400 in 1913.", "So while the dollar is worth far less today, we have far more of them to spend.If we blame the Fed for inflation (and the taming of inflation in recent decades), seems they should also get some credit for growth in real incomes, Pfitzner said.Barry Bosworth, an economist at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, said the Federal Reserve isn't responsible for the U.S. dollar's value, which he called pretty constant relative to other currencies.The decline in the value of the dollar is the result of inflation, but advocates of the gold standard may argue that it could have been avoided if the U.S. had stayed on the gold standard, so they blame the Federal Reserve Bank, Bosworth said.So lets look back over the facts.No doubt, the value of a dollar has plummeted since 1913, when milk cost eight cents a quart.", "The Tea Partys says the buck has dropped by 98 percent, but its use of the gold standard to measure the greenback is not a relevant gauge.", "Using the Consumer Price index, as many economists recommend, we find the dollar fell by 95 percent since 1913.So the Tea Party, despite its disputed methods, wound up with a figure thats in the ballpark.But in bemoaning the drop in value of a dollar, the Tea Party omits a huge mitigating factor: salaries have grown enormously since 1913 and consumers have more to spend.", "If the Feds historic handling of

If this is risky, I know a guy at Merrill or Dean Witter.And NationsBank helped NationsSecurities by providing brokers with lists of customers who had Certificates of Deposit about to mature.The bank and stock brokers pushed the mutual funds because they received more lucrative fees, Cray said.The allegations led to a class-action lawsuit from investors who lost money by unknowingly making the risky investments, which in the end lost money. The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission also began investigations. Eventually, NationsBank and NationsSecurities settled the investigations, agreeing to pay $8.1 million to investors in 2002, paying civil fines to the federal government of $6.75 million in 2000 and $6.4 million in 2002 and $4 million to the SEC in 1998. No criminal charges were ever filed.Sink says the lawyer who started the case, Jonathan Alpert of Tampa, has said Sink had nothing to do with the scheme.Here's what Alpert told theSt. Petersburg TimesandMiami Heraldin October when previously asked about Sink's role in selling the risky investments.Alex Sink could've done nothing about it. It was run out of Charlotte, said Alpert, referring to NationsBank's headquarters. I know she knew what was going on - that investments were being sold in the bank -- but that's it. And she was powerless to stop it, anyway. I had e-mails where the state presidents were being told what to do, that they had to help the securities people. They would dig into customers bank accounts to identify people who had enough money to buy securities.", "hrefs": "https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/oct/26/rick-scott/alex-sink-faces-her-own-fraud-charges-cnnst-peters/"}], "label": "true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2010/oct/25/glenn-nye/glenn-nye-claims-he-voted-against-wall-street-bail/", "title": "Says he voted no on the Wall Street bailouts.", "author": "Warren Fiske", "posted": "10/25/2010", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["U.S. Rep Glenn Nye portrays himself as a boldly independent Democrat who bucks his party on key issues such as health-care reform and the Wall Street bailout.In at least four TV ads, the freshman congressman from Virginia Beach and Norfolk has stressed he voted against the bank bailout, which is formally known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.I stood up to my party leaders and voted no on the Wall Street bailouts, Nye said in one ad.", "(To emphasize his theme, he titled the ad Independence.", ")But theres a big problem with his claim: Nye was not a member of Congress when TARP was approved.The final House vote approving TARP came Oct. 3, 2008 -- 32 days before Nye was elected and 95 days before he took office.The bill set up a $700 billion bailout fund for banks that had made bad investments.", "President George W.

Republican primary for governor, is trying to use a similar tactic against his Democratic opponent, Alex Sink.Scott is highlighting Sink's record as a member of the Florida Cabinet in a new ad called No bid, alleging that Sink steered government contracts -- and the money that goes with it -- to her former employer Bank of America. Watch the adhere.Newspapers discovered Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink funneled three quarters of a million dollars in no-bid contracts to Bank of America, the narrator says. That's the same Bank of America once run by, you guessed it, Alex Sink.The ad goes on to say that Sink never disclosed her conflict of interest and never even asked for other bids.We wanted to put the no-bid Bank of America contract claim to the rigors of the Truth-O-Meter.The single source in the ad is aSt. Petersburg Timesarticle published Aug. 2, 2009. Thearticle, written by Sydney P. Freedberg and Adam C. Smith, deals with Sink's decision to create a blind trust to manage her personal investments. A blind trust is pretty much what it sounds like: Sink's investments are managed by third-party trustees, and Sink does not know when she buys or sells stocks.She created the blind trust in December 2006 to guard against speculation that her stock portfolio would affect her decisions as state chief financial officer. Those very allegations dogged her predecessor, Tom Gallagher, who while in office traded stock in companies that had contracts with the state or were regulated by his office.TheTimesarticle pointed out some flaws in Sink's decision, namely that the trust isn't truly blind because Sink knew what investments initially made up the blind trust. She also isn't required to list the specific investments that make up her blind trust as part of her annual financial disclosure form.What does any of that have to do with funneling money to Bank of America, as Scott's ad alleges?Sink said that what went into her blind trust is substantially what she reported on a financial disclosure statement in 2006. Among other holdings, it listed two accounts that contained $4.9 million in assets, including stock in Bank of America and Raymond James. Sink spent 26 years in banking, retiring in 2000 as head of Bank of America's Florida operations. That year, she made $3.4 million from the bank in salary, pension, deferred compensation and stock grants.In their article, Freedberg and Smith pointed out that Sink could still own Bank of America stock.And in late 2008, Freedberg and Smith said, she voted with the governor and other Cabinet members to allow negotiated, or no-bid, bond deals for a financial underwriting team that includes her former employer, Bank of America. One transaction resulted in $770,000 in fees for a subsidiary of the bank and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit.If a state official casts a vote that would result in private gain, Florida law requires the official to disclose the conflict within 15 days.

pension system unless they have previously worked in a legitimate business.", "Meanwhile, participation by the self-employed was for many years voluntary (and very low), though mandatory participation is being phased in by the 2008 reforms.", "Even among workers in traditional jobs, participation rates have usually topped out around 80 percent, with the percentage taking part at any given time even lower, since workers do not always keep up their contributions due to unemployment or a failure to comply with the law.This is a serious issue.", "As Kritzer notes, only a small portion of workers with less-than-perfect participation histories would have enough contributions to qualify for the guaranteed minimum benefit at retirement.", "The 2008 reform addressed coverage concerns by introducing a universal pension paid to all Chileans over the age of 65 regardless of their contribution history.", "In addition, workers with small pensions from their individual accounts will have them topped up by the government.While we think it's fair for the ad to note that the Chilean system has holes, it's important to note that the pre-1981 system had holes too -- and that the nature of

By now, almost all Chileans are enrolled in the post-1981 system.The program details have changed somewhat over the years, most recently due to a major round of changes in 2008. But the general outline has remained the same. Ten percent of workers' income is automatically deducted to fund their retirement, disability and survivor insurance, plus an additional charge for administrative costs. Employees can choose from among several government-approved private pension management companies, each of which offers five varieties of funds with varying degrees of risk. The funds and their approaches have been reviewed by a government regulator. Total assets in the system by the end of 2009 reached $107 billion in U.S dollars, or about 65 percent of Chiles gross domestic product.Because the Chilean system has been a trendsetter, it has been studied extensively. Independent analyses suggest that over the long term, the level of support for retirees under Chile's system has been close or better than that in similar countries. But the Chilean system has also faced its share of criticism. Some of that criticism echoes what the ad says. Here's a closer look at the three issues raised in the ad.Hidden fees. High fees have been a longstanding concern about the Chilean system. Due to lack of competition among private-sector money managers that participate in the system, these management companies' profits have been much larger than profit margins in other sectors of Chiles financial services industry, wrote U.S. Social Security Administration researcher Barbara E. Kritzer in one paper. Over a full career contributing to the system, workers pay around 15 percent for administration, according to the International Organization of Pension Supervisors. This is in the middle of six Latin American countries and below five Eastern European countries with a Chilean-style individual accounts system. Several experts said that a series of government reforms in 2008 helped lower fees.In our reporting, we found that even supporters of the system acknowledged that fees have been a problem. But are they hidden, as the ad says? None of the handful of experts we spoke to said so. In fact, fees are more obvious to contributors in Chile than in other countries because they are levied on top of the mandatory contribution to private pensions. So while the ad is on track in its criticism of fees, it is wrong to say they are hidden.Fewer benefits. Most studies have shown a long-term rate of return in the Chilean system of roughly 10 percent, which is high by international standards. But even if those rates of return are optimistic going forward -- whether because they were boosted by a period of unusually strong returns or because of insufficient participation by Chilean workers in the plan -- experts we spoke to agreed that for Chileans, the current system is preferable to the pre-1981 system. In fact, Pinochet's system remained in place after the transition to democracy and was retained by the socialist administration of Michelle Bachelet. (Bachelet lost power in March 2010.)Mauricio Soto of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College has written that the old pension system was in crisis prior to 1981 -- paying more in benefits than it was receiving in contributions, with a projected actuarial imbalance greater than the country's gross domestic product. In addition, the patchwork system was poorly administered and inefficient and led to discrepancies in which white-collar workers could comfortably retire in their 40s, while blue-collar workers had to wait until their 60s to qualify for minimum retirement benefits.There's no question that the current investor-based pension system carries risks, being subject to markets that can go up or down. But Chile's old system simply wasn't sustainable. It was unfunded and essentially a fantasy, said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, a longtime champion of the Chilean system.So to suggest, as the ad does, that switching to a private system in 1981 resulted in fewer benefits is at best misleading.Millions of people with no coverage. This charge is true -- but misleading for a couple reasons.Though the proportion of Chileans participating in the system has varied over time, the percentage has hovered around two-thirds, a rate similar to under the pre-1981 system. This is clearly less than the nearly universal coverage provided by the U.S. Social Security system. But Chile is also not nearly as rich as the U.S.Several experts we spoke to agreed that the coverage gaps have at least as much to do with the nature of the Chilean economy as with the design of the country's retirement system. Soto notes that low-income Chileans working in the underground economy account for about 30 percent of the workforce. These workers are typically not covered by the pension system unless they have previously worked in a legitimate business. Meanwhile, participation by the self-employed was for many years voluntary (and very low), though mandatory participation is being phased in by the 2008 reforms. Even among workers in traditional jobs, participation rates have usually topped out around 80 percent, with the percentage taking part at any given time even lower, since workers do not always keep up their contributions due to unemployment or a failure to comply with the law.This is a serious issue. As Kritzer notes, only a small portion of workers with less-than-perfect participation histories would have enough contributions to qualify for the guaranteed minimum benefit at retirement. The 2008 reform addressed coverage concerns by introducing a universal pension paid to all Chileans over the age of 65 regardless of their contribution history. In addition, workers with small pensions from their individual accounts will have them topped up by the government.While we think it's fair for the ad to note that the Chilean system has holes, it's important to note that the pre-1981 system had holes too -- and that the nature of the Chilean economy plays at least as big a role in causing this problem as the retirement system itself.So where does this leave us? The ad demonizes the Chilean system in ways that we think are exaggerated. Fees are a problem, but they are not hidden. Rather than offering smaller benefits, the system has provided strong returns and is almost certainly sounder today than prior to 1981. And the coverage gaps that exist now are not unique to the privatized system and have a lot to do with specific factors at play in Chile.The ad does have a point that the Chilean system, at least if it's implemented without major differences, would likely be seen by most Americans as inferior to Social Security. The size of the coverage gaps in Chile's system, while understandable given Chile's economic situation, would be unacceptable to many, if not most, Americans. But this reasonable point is undercut by the ad's overheated rhetoric (human rights violator), imagery (the goose-stepping soldiers) and exaggerations about the substance of the Chilean plan.

$26.574 trillion for the entire economy.", "That's 18 percent.", "If you calculate it as a share of the private economy alone, which was $23.467 trillion that year, then it accounted for a little under 21 percent.Neither calculation reaches the 25 percent Gregory specified -- but the best estimation for the financial sector may be even lower.We asked economists whether they thought that

would be wrong, said J.D.", "Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation.", "At the core of Gregory's premise is that people are making money off of money.", "Real estate, rental, and leasing all involve tangible property of some sort.Fortunately, the statistics break out finance and insurance as a separate total.", "This category generated $2.169 trillion in gross output in 2008, which equals about 8 percent of the whole economy and 9 percent of the private economy.", "So by this measure, the actual percentage is far below what Gregory said.Value added by industry.",

you use the narrower finance and insurance figure instead, you'll find that this category generated $1.198 trillion in value added in 2009, which equals about 8 percent of the entire economy and almost 10 percent of the private economy.", "Once again, the narrower category falls far short of Gregory's estimate.Compensation of employees by industry.", "For 2008, finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing accounted for about $718 billion in employee compensation, compared to $8.037 trillion for the whole economy.", "That's 9 percent.", "If you calculate it with private

Burtless, an economist with the liberal-to-centrist Brookings Institution, suggests that Gregory may have been thinking about financial-sector corporate profits as a share of all corporate profits, which requires a different calculation.In 2009, the financial sector -- which does not appear to include real estate in this case -- recorded $331.2 billion in profits.", "Compared to the $1.309

Burtless said.", "The years 1950 to 1973 were pretty good years for middle-income families, and back in that era, financial companies earned an average of 13 percent of all corporate profits.", "If Gregory was trying to suggest there may be something wrong with an economy in which 25 percent of corporate profits are earned by bankers, brokers, hedge fund managers, insurance companies, and the like, there may be something to that argument.A final note.", "While we aren't directly rating Gregory's claim that the financial sector ... doesn't actually make anything besides money, we thought it would be worth relaying a strong objection to Gregory's characterization by Foster of Heritage.You don't have to love Wall Street or the big banks to acknowledge the vital role of financial markets in

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who notes that the loans were repaid not with GM earnings (in fact, SEC filings show GM expected to have negative net cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2009) but rather from GM tapping into a multi-billion-dollar TARP-funded escrow account.Therefore, it is unclear how GM and the Administration could have accurately announced yesterday that GM repaid its TARP loans in any

financial condition is stabilizing.", "So we felt it prudent to start to get the taxpayer their money back.In a Senate Finance Committee hearing on April 20, 2010, Neil Barofsky, the special inspector general for the TARP, was similarly asked if GM was taking money out of one pocket and putting it in the other to do that.The source of that was an equity capital facility ... that's basically escrow money, Barofsky said.Some of the money that was given to GM, it basically wasn't all given as a lump sum check, saying, here, all this money's available to you, Barofsky explained.", "Some of it was

any money left in that account after a certain period of time, it has to be used to repay the debt.And basically what GM is doing is it's pulling that forward, and it's taking the money out of this TARP capital facility and using it to pay off the debt, the $6.7 billion debt that was previously owed.ABC News quoted a Treasury Department spokesman saying that the cash in the restricted account was the property of GM.This account was expected to be used for extraordinary expenses, the Treasury official said, and the fact that GM has decided that it does not need to reserve these funds for expenses is a positive sign for our overall investment.In an interview with PolitiFact, Lawrence J.", "White, economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, warned not to make too much of the source of the funding.To me, money is fungible, he said.", "''At the end of the day, it shows that GM found itself with enough of a surplus to pay back this piece of government support.", "The

the slate with the U.S. government.", "Whitacre's claim may be technically accurate, White said, but if it was meant to give the impression that that clears GM from its financial involvement with the federal government, that's not correct.Said David Zaring, professor at the Wharton School of Business: Its absolutely an exaggeration based on the fact that the government owns 60 percent of the company.", "But yes, thats a repayment of money by a company the taxpayer owns.", "In that sense, I wouldnt really crow too much about the repayment, if I were Ed Whitacre.Several economists we spoke to said the repayment is undeniably a sign of progress for the struggling company.", "But nearly 90 percent of the government's investment in General Motors through TARP still hangs in the balance,

agency to regulate consumer financial products.", "Rather, he opted to establish a new regulator inside the Federal Reserve.", "Furthermore, the manager's amendment included more than 20 Democratic amendments.", "One, for instance, would give a new council looking for emerging threats to the financial system the authority to decide what events are likely trigger a liquidity crisis.It's also

them, said an account inCongressional Quarterly.", "Dodd said his committee held an open markup.", "401 amendments were filed with the committee, but my Republican colleagues did not bring up a single amendment and declined my offer to include some of their amendments in the managers amendment.So, while it's unclear why GOP members decided to withdraw their amendments, it appears they had the

simply saying that he expected bipartisan talks after the bill passed the committee.But to say that no amendments were adopted at all is incorrect.So Corker is correct that it only took the committee about 21 minutes to debate and vote on the bill, and he's also right that Democratic leaders promised more bipartisan negotiation before the legislation comes to the Senate floor.", "But he's wrong

Any little bit of light underneath the door will inevitably be exploited.Ultimately, our sources agreed that while the bill makes aggressive efforts to reduce the likelihood of bailouts, it doesn't make them illegal. And short of, say, passing a constitutional amendment ruling out bailouts, any future Congress or administration would be able to act as conditions demanded.Nothing, not even a bill by Mr. McConnell, would rule out bailouts, said Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business. There's no realistic legislation that could absolutely guarantee no bailouts.Finally, a word about Reid's reference to taxpayer. It's true that the bill, as of now, would use an industry fund to pay for winding down troubled companies, meaning taxpayers would not be directly involved. But James Gattuso, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, writes that whether the money comes from other banks or from taxpayers is a distinction without a difference, since the costs would eventually be passed on to consumers.", "hrefs": "http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/20/mitch-mcconnell/bank-bailouts-not-bill-liquidation/"}], "label": "barely-true"}, {"url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2010/apr/20/mitch-mcconnell/bank-bailouts-not-bill-liquidation/", "title": "New financial regulation actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks.", "author": "Angie Drobnic Holan", "posted": "04/20/2010", "sci_digest": [], "paragraphs": ["Sen.

We do not see any element of the bill that expressly permits ongoing, endless outlays from the federal treasury.
