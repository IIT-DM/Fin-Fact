Decades ago, some outlaw biker gangs appropriated several Nazi-related symbols, including the SS bolts, essentially as shock symbols or symbols of rebellion or non-conformity. Thus SS bolts in the context of the outlaw biker subculture does not necessarily denote actual adherence to white supremacy. However, because there are a number of racists and full-blown white supremacists within the outlaw biker subculture, sometimes it actually is used as a symbol of white supremacy. Often the intended use and meaning of the SS bolts in this context is quite ambiguous and difficult to determine. The photograph of the \"Bikers for Trump\" member with an 'SS' tattoo on his arm was taken in Portland, Oregon, during a \"Patriot Prayer\" rally. That photograph was not shared by President Trump, nor did any other information suggest the same person was in attendance at the 'Bikers for Trump' rally in Bedminster, New Jersey.

Bernie Sanders linking to an article in The Nation about the rising cost of insulin: several local outlets reported post The Nation We cannot call ourselves a great country as long our young people are literally dying because they cannot afford life-saving medication. This young man, Shane Patrick Boyle, died on March 18 after his GoFundMe campaign to pay for insulin came up $50 short. Something has got to change. Our job is to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and enact policies that make prescription drugs affordable for everyonenot ones that make the CEOs of the pharmaceutical industry rich. In addition to highlighting the sad circumstances surrounding Boyle's death, The Nation also pointed to Alec Raeshawn Smith, a 26-year-old who died in June after he lost his insurance and started to ration his insulin: died Alec Raeshawn Smith, age 26, was found dead in his apartment on June 27. He was rationing his insulin after he aged out of his parents insurance coverage. The sad fact is more people would be alive today if insulin was affordable for all Americans. The deaths of Smith and Boyle and their reported struggles with health insurance were met with skepticism by some readers. Others encountered this news on social media, where it was shared with incomplete or incorrect information. For instance, comedian David Anthony conflated the deaths of these two individuals when he wrote that a 26-year-old had started a GoFundMe to get insulin: For the rest of my life I will never forget a 26 year old started a gofundme to get insulin, didnt get the amount he needed and died rationing his not costly medicine. Just before Thanksgiving.  Dave Anthony (@daveanthony) November 24, 2017 November 24, 2017  Alec Raeshawn Smith was 26 years old at the time of his death; however, we have not been able to find anything to indicate that he had set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for insulin. (A fundraiser was set up after his death to cover funeral costs.) Shane Patrick Boyle, on the other hand, was older when he died, and he did set up a fundraiser for medication. fundraiser Smith passed away on 27 June 2017. In his obituary, his family asked for donations to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, and encouraged everyone to sign a petition for affordable health care: obituary In lieu of flowers memorial donations may be given to Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, www.jdrf.org. We would also like to encourage everyone to go to www.jdrf.org and sign the Coverage 2 Control petition which will provide affordability, choice and coverage for people with Diabetes.  www.jdrf.org www.jdrf.org Boyle died of the same treatable complication that killed Smith: diabetic ketoacidosis. Before his death on 18 March 2017, he set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for one month of insulin:   The only archived version of this campaign is from 23 March 2017, five days after Boyle's death. Although this copy shows that Boyle had raised $1,590 of a $750 goal, it appears that the majority of this money was raised after his passing. (All eight comments were posted in the days following Boyle's death and the visible donations, more than $200, were posted within a day of its archival date.) Ted Closson, a comic book artist and friend of Boyle's, wrote that Boyle was \"$50 shy of his goal\" for over two weeks: wrote   A second GoFundMe campaign to raise money for a memorial for Boyle and his mother also suggests that the fundraiser was short of the $750 goal at the time of Boyle's passing (emphasis ours): campaign The world lost a wonderful man due to complications of type 1 diabetes. My cousin, Shane Boyle, put everything into taking care of his ailing mother at the expense of his own needs. Shane's mother, Judy Boyle, passed away on March 11th and we lost Shane to diabetes exactly a week later on March 18th. After his death, we learned that Shane lost his prescription benefits when he moved to Mena, Arkansas to care for his mom. We found a GoFundMe where he was trying to raise $750 to get just one more month of insulin and supplies. Unfortunately, he didn't get help in time. Shane died because he was trying to stretch out his life saving insulin to make it last longer. Shane was working hard to take care of his mother's funeral arrangements when he died. Her service had to be cancelled because of the unexpected financial burden of losing two family members in a week's time. I am hoping we can raise the funds for a combined funeral service for Shane and Judy Boyle. If we can raise more than is needed for the service, any remaining funds would go to a charity that provides insulin to diabetics like Shane. We don't want other families to suffer the pain of losing a loved one because they couldn't afford medications. Thank you for any help you can provide, even if all you can offer is a kind message or sharing a special memory. Vice also mentioned the circumstances surrounding Boyle's death in a story about the rising price of insulin. rising Long before Boyle launched a fundraising campaign, he worried about a Trump presidency's effects on the price of insulin. Immediately after the election, on 9 November 2016, Boyle wrote on Facebook (emphasis ours): wrote Facebook Last night/ this morning, I was so depressed I did not want to live in this world anymore (and as a type one diabetic, I honestly don't know how long I will live if I lose access to affordable healthcare). Today, I feel more optimistic, not because I think everything is going to be okay, but because I have seen so many of your posts, recognizing the fight that is ahead, and talking about organizing, not just sitting back and complaining or planning for the next election.

The claim, predictably, went viral, with people from across the United States posting angry comments on unrelated City of Roanoke Facebook posts. claim Facebook live videos Someone claiming to have knowledge of the incident also commented, claiming that Durham's boyfriend had threatened a coworker. The comment was later deleted:   Although we were unable to substantiate those claims, the City of Roanoke's Office of Communications sent us a statement refuting Durham's claim on 12 March 2018: A former employee of the City of Roanoke recently posted via social media assertions regarding the basis of her dismissal from City employment. Her posting has also been reported in other media. The City does not publicly comment on specific personnel matters. In light of these assertions, however, it is important to note that the City of Roanoke respects the Constitutional rights of its citizens and that the dismissal in question was not based upon anyones exercise of such rights. In addition, the office told us: The City has no policy or procedure limiting the right of its employees to hold concealed carry permits as authorized by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Durham herself told The Roanoke Times that her termination papers showed different reasons for her firing from the city, where she had worked for less than a year: reasons Four months ago, she said, her trainer taught her a procedure that she followed, but then was reprimanded for it by her supervisor. So she alerted her trainer, who sent her a nasty email calling her sloppy and unprofessional. Durham said she took the matter to her supervisor, who, along with the trainer, threw her under the bus. Later, Durham said, she was given a set of performance expectations that required her to close cases at a faster pace. She acknowledged it took her time to adjust to the caseload in Roanoke after coming from rural Craig County, but said she exceeded all expectations. However, Durham said, she was told that it was actually because of her gun permit: The next day, at about 4:30 p.m. Friday, she was summoned to the office of the assistant director of the department, was told she was being fired and given the document listing the reasons. At the top, she said, was a concern about workplace safety. Durham said she asked about it and was told by the assistant director that her possession of a concealed weapons permit made her a safety risk in the building and for co-workers. Three Roanoke police officers escorted her to her desk, Durham said, where her personal possessions were loaded onto a cart and pushed to her car by one of the officers while the two others escorted her out of the building. We obtained a copy of the official police report in response to our request, which reads in part: Mr. Goss advised that she has a conceal carry permit and believed that she usually has a weapon in her vehicle.... We arrived at 1547 hours. The call was reported on the 3rd floor (Social Services Department). Upon arrival to the 3rd floor we were escorted to one of the offices in the back where we met with Mr. Goss and another employee advising us they wanted us there because they didn't know how Ms. Durham was going to react to the situation. On 13 March 2018, a copy of Storm Durham's termination letter was shared by WSLS.com. In it, \"performance concerns, attendance, dress code issues and unprofessional behavior\" were cited as the reasons for her dismissal: shared   13 March 2018, 3:46 P.M.: Added excerpts from The Roanoake Times and the official police report. 14 March 2018, 2:43 P.M.: Added letter of termination provided to Durham by the City of Roanoke Department of Social Services.

        ],
        "justification": "On 28 December 2015, an image purportedly showing a shark attacking two motorists stranded on a flooded Missouri highway started going viral on Facebook:  Before we examine the origins of the above-displayed image, let's take a moment to judge the authenticity of the photograph based on simple common sense. The man in the above-displayed picture is standing in about thigh-high water, and since the average male in the United States is about5 foot 9, we can reasonably assume that the water is no more than a fewfeet deep. The rest of the lane is visible in the upper left-hand corner of the image, so it appears that this flood only affected a small portion of the roadway. Also, Missouri is a landlocked state in the central U.S. far from any ocean, so any flood waters in that area would likely be fresh water and not salt water. All of these factors make the pictured site a highly unlikely habitat for the ocean-going great white shark species. average In fact, a larger version of the image clearly shows that entire road is not flooded:  The text accompanying the image alleges that the incident took place in Missouri, a Midwestern state located about 400 miles north of the Gulf of Mexico:  While that is not an impossible distance for a great white shark to travel, it is highly implausible that a large sea creature such as a shark would be able to traverse a fresh water river all the way from the ocean up toMissouri. (A story earlier this year about a bull shark caught in the Missouri River turned out to bean April Fool's joke.) story The Facebook post also mentions that the shark attack victims pictured were recent recipients of Mark Zuckerberg's alleged $4.5 million giveaway. This is another indication that the photograph is a jape, since the claim that the founder of Facebook was giving away money to random people on Facebook was itself a hoax. money While Bill Tennison scored a viral hit in December 2015 when he claimed that a motorist was attacked by a shark on a flooded highway in Missouri, he wasn't the first person to sharethis fake photograph. This image has been circulatingonline since at least 2000 and has been attached to flood waters in Ireland, Houston, Englandand New Orleans. Ireland Houston England New Orleans Also, as many commenters have pointed out, the license plates, road signs, and cars seen in the image indicate the pictured road is more likely located somewhere in the United Kingdom than Missouri. Update: We received the following comment on 31 December 2015 from Stephen Rushbrook. Rushbrook This was taken by Computer game Artist Russell Hughes when he was working for Stainless Games back at our farmhouse offices in the Isle of Wight That spot is infamous for flooding. So on that stormy day we were all by the roadside laughing at those who didn't know how to drive through a flood. Later (after the pub, blacksmiths arms just up the road) he turned his photo into this. He then sent it to the company. It escaped when Matt Edmunds sent it to his friend at Reuters. It then became 'news picture of the day' and that was that. Within the day we were getting emails from our friends from round the world saying have you seen this ?

The cruel practice takes place on French-controlled Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, where Prince William spent two holidays. A six-month-old labrador pup was recently found ALIVE with a huge double hook through its snout  like the dog above  and another through a leg. The pup was found in a coastal creek and is thought to have somehow freed itself from a fishing line. But other dogs and kittens have been chomped up and swallowed by sharks. The RSPCA plans to petition the French government, demanding an end to the hideous torture.  [Collected on the Internet, September 2012] PETITION: Please help stop French Islander and Mexican fishermen using live dogs and kittens as shark bait To: The French and Mexican Governments We have to stop this PLEASE help! French Islanders using live puppies and kittens as shark bait?? Please stop this senseless abuse to innocent puppies and kittens. French Islander and Mexican fishermen are using LIVE puppies and kittens as shark bait!! No living being should have to undergo this torture and insurmountable fear! This is inhumane and must stop NOW. Together we can make a difference and let our voice be heard as ONE. Please sign this petition and please pass this along. Thank you for caring. Blessed be Currently the penalty is only 2 years and $36,000 that is far too little for such a heinous crime. We urge that you raise the penalty to 10 years in prison with NO parole and a fine of $100,000. This will hopefully act as a deterrent and will stop these horrendous acts against innocent animals. Please do the right thing and help us stop these people. Islanders on the French controlled Reunion Island have been using live dogs as shark bait. The Sun claims that a six-month-old labrador pup was recently found alive with a huge double hook through its snout  like the dog above  and another through a leg. It is also claimed that local fisherman have also been using kittens! Reunion Island is an overseas dpartements of France and an official region of France, giving it the same status as a province or state in other countries. The claim that live dogs (and cats) were being used as bait by shark fisherman on Runion Island (a French-controlled territory just off the coast of Southern Africa in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar) started hitting the world press in August 2005 and picked up steam in early October 2005, when it was reported by publications such as the UK's Sun (an excerpt from which is quoted at the head of this page) and Sweden's Aftonbladet, complete with a heart-rending picture of a purported \"bait dog\" with a large hook through its muzzle. Animal rights groups such as the RSPCA have taken up the cause of putting a stop to the horrible practice. Runion Island Sun Aftonbladet RSPCA Many observers remain skeptical of such claims, however, positing theories that range from media and animal rights groups having been taken in by a hoax to a deliberate disinformation campaign being waged by activists who seek to end the slaughter of sharks for their fins and cartilage by Indian Ocean fisherman. Arguments have flown back and forth over the practicality and plausibility (or lack thereof) of Runion Islanders fishing for sharks in the manner described. activists A 2006 Runion newspaper article acknowledged the practice and reported the recent prosecution of a deliveryman (and amateur fisherman) on that island over animal cruelty charges associated with the described activity, suggesting that although there may be some truth to the shark-fishing claim, the practice does not appear to be as widespread or horrific (or tolerated) as implied by news reports in the foreign press. Rather than describing hordes of shark fisherman impaling live dogs on hooks and dragging them behind boats as shark bait, the article noted that employing dogs in shark-fishing was largely the province of a small group of amateur fisherman rather than large numbers of professionals, that the dogs used were generally dead animals picked up from roadsides or culled from the island's large population of unwanted strays (estimated at 150,000), and that the no-longer-alive animals were attached to unattended buoyed \"shark trap\" platforms rather than dragged alive behind boats. article The French embassy in Washington, D.C., also maintained that although the practice was not unknown, its occurrence and acceptance was not nearly as prevalent as recent news reports had made it seem: Dear Sir/Madam,Thank you for writing to us with your concerns. We too denounce the barbaric practices you refer to. Such acts are obviously illegal and will not be tolerated on French territory. But while we share your revulsion, we would like to emphasize that the practice of using live dogs or cats as shark bait is in fact exceptional and isolated. It was never widespread nor traditional, but introduced by ruthless individuals, and has been strictly banned for decades now. TV reports that raised initial indignation when they were aired in France and abroad in 2005 were filmed locally in 2003 following the discovery of a mutilated dog. The last few months have seen two identical events which received heavy media coverage (one of these events was soon determined to be a false alarm). But can these vile occurrences lead us to conclude that there is an ongoing tradition of barbarism on Reunion Island? Reunion Island, a French territory and a European region, obeys the laws and regulations of the French Republic and the European Union. It respects the rule of law and does not practice inhumane ancestral practices. The facts that elicited your complaint are the act of a few isolated, irresponsible parties who are being sought by the police and will be brought to justice. The authorities on the island are closely monitoring the situation; one person is in custody and appeared in court on Friday September 30, 2005. All suspicions of such acts will be investigated, and animal protection organizations that have any specific information on these matters are strongly encouraged to inform French police authorities. The French minister for agriculture and fisheries, Dominique Bussereau, is fully aware of the media and public outcry regarding this issue, and has written to the French National Assembly to emphasize that several measures have been taken to strengthen already existing laws. Veterinarians have been directed to immediately report any suspicious wounds to authorities, and the police will increase their inspections of fishing and pleasure vessels. Meanwhile, a sterilization campaign, launched in 2001 to reduce the number of stray dogs and cats on the island, continues. Animal rights are an important issue in France: over half of French households have at least one pet, and France has some of the world's most stringent animal rights legislation. French law provides for the prosecution of those who are cruel to animals. Voluntary cruelty to animals is punishable by a sentence of two years in prison and a 30,000 euro fine (equivalent to about $36,000).

Rather than describing hordes of shark fisherman impaling live dogs on hooks and dragging them behind boats as shark bait, the article noted that employing dogs in shark-fishing was largely the province of a small group of amateur fisherman rather than large numbers of professionals, that the dogs used were generally dead animals picked up from roadsides or culled from the island's large population of unwanted strays (estimated at 150,000), and that the no-longer-alive animals were attached to unattended buoyed \"shark trap\" platforms rather than dragged alive behind boats.",

            "College students tripping on LSD stared at the sun until they went blind?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Several students tripping on LSD stared at the sun until blinded.  \nStatus:  False.\n Origins:  This   legend, one the 1960s' most ubiquitous pieces of drug scarelore (along with \"teenager on acid trip thinks he can fly and jumps out window\") was nothing but pure hoax.  Nonetheless, the national print media fell for it twice. This twisted tale was born on Thursday, 18 May 1967, when California newspapers began reporting a horrific tale concerning some Santa Barbara college students who damaged their eyes by staring at the sun while they were under the influence of LSD.  Here's how the story was written up by the Los Angeles Times:  \n\nFROM SUN GAZING WHILE ON 'TRIP' Four LSD Users Suffer Serious Eye Damage Exclusive to The Times from a Staff Writer SANTA BARBARA  Four college students have suffered permanent impairment of vision as a result of staring at the sun while under the influence of LSD, according to a spokesman for the Santa Barbara Ophthalmological Society. One of the youths told his doctor he was \"holding a religious conversation with the sun.\" Another said he had gazed at the sun \"to produce unusual visual displays.\" The students, all males, suffered damage to the retina, the sensory membrane which receives the image formed by the lens. In the same way that a piece of paper will burn when bright light is beamed through a magnifying glass, a pinhead-size hole was burned into the retina of each eye of the students as sunlight passed through the lens. What this has left the students with is not total blindness but a blind spot in the center of their vision. As a result, the victims have lost their reading vision completely and forever, the ophthalmological spokesman said. \"For example, if you wanted to read,\" he said, \"you might see all of the corners of the page and most of the print  except you wouldn't be able to see that one word you were looking at. \"If you were to look at a traffic stoplight, you might see the pole and trees and cars  but you wouldn't see the stoplight itself. \"That little black hole always moves directly where you want to see,\" he said. Solar burns of the retina, the spokesman said, are not uncommon, particularly among children watching eclipses of the sun.  But he knew of no previous cases which resulted from someone being under the influence of LSD. In the cases here, the victims admitted they were users of LSD. Three of them attend UC Santa Barbara, the other goes to Santa Barbara City College. Their ages range from 18 to 24. The spokesman said it was his impression that each of the sun-staring incidents occurred separately. He did not know whether the students knew each other. The four had no awareness of pain or discomfort while the sun was burning through the eye tissue, the spokesman said. The damage is permanent, because tissue so damaged does not regenerate itself.\n Do you recall the first of those six one-word interrogatives all good journalists are supposed to ask?  Good.    Now ask yourself, what the heck happened to the who in this story?  Not a SINGLE NAME is mentioned anywhere in the article! None of the students is identified, none of the doctors who presumably treated them is named, the ophthamologist quoted at length is never referred to any more specifically than \"a spokesman,\" and even the reporter (\"a staff writer\") remains anonymous.  How is it that this unidentified reporter managed to procure bizarre quotes from the alleged victims (e.g., \"I was holding a religious conversation with the sun\") yet failed to gather any other basic information, such as the students' names or places of residence?  Why is it that no mention is made of the medical facility where these students were presumably treated?  How come the \"spokesman for the Santa Barbara Ophthalmological Society,\" who is quoted at length, is never identified?   This story has HOAX written all over it, even before we consider the implausibility of four students' independently staring at the sun until their retinas burned, all on the same day in the same town. (A similar article from the San Francisco Chronicle, also credited to an anonymous \"correspondent,\" mentions that the ophthamologist \"would not be identified,\" and that he \"refused to reveal the victims' identity.\") The LSD horror story was picked up by the Associated Press and quickly spread all over the U.S., appearing in such  prominent news publications such as The New York Times and Time magazine.  One might expect that even though these staid news journals were taken in by the hoax, they learned their lesson when no more details were forthcoming.  (We saw, for example, no follow-up articles describing how these students were coping with their impaired vision, nor did the press offer any rueful \"I'll never use drugs again\" comments from any of the unfortunate victims once they'd had time to reflect on their foolishness.)  It took a scant eight months before the media were trumpeting the same headline again.  Here's an Associated Press dispatch as it appeared in the Los Angeles Times on 13 January 1968: \n\n6 College Men Take LSD, Blinded by Sun WASHINGTON (AP)  Six college men suffered total and permanent blindness by staring at the sun while under the influence of the drug LSD, it was learned Friday. The six, all juniors at a western Pennsylvania college that officials decline to name, lost their sight after they took the hallucinatory drug together last spring. Norman M. Yoder, commissioner of the Office of the Blind in the Pennsylvania State Welfare Department, said the retinal areas of the youths' eyes were destroyed. Federal officials questioned about the case said it is the first they have heard of in which total blindness resulted. The only similar case officials knew of was one reported last May in which four students at the University of California at Santa Barbara suffered permanent loss of their reading vision by staring at the sun after taking LSD. Lie on backs in Sun Yoder said in a telephone interview from Harrisburg that the Pennsylvania students all had taken LSD at least once before. He said they went to a grassy area in a woodland about half a mile from the college and took the drug there. Then, he said, they all lay on their backs in the grass \"and were not consciously looking at the sun.\" The youths were found at the scene, blind and helpless, the afternoon of the same day by fellow students  who knew of the \"trip\" plans. Those using the drug had been gone about six hours. Yoder said the youths didn't even realize they were staring at the sun \"until they came out of the trance,\" but that they had come to their senses when the other students arrived. The afflicted students have since been receiving rehabilitation services of the Pennsylvania Welfare Department.\n First of all, notice that the ante has been upped: now there are six students; the victims have been made completely blind; and, as Newsweek described it, this tragedly befell engineering students who were \"nice kids, not hippies\" (unlike those California freaks who blathered on about having \"religious conversations with the sun\"). And once again, there's that nagging non-specificity of detail: the students, their school, their rescuers, the doctors who treated them, and the medical facility where they were taken are all unnamed.  The spokesman is identified this time, but as we're about to see, Dr. Norman M. Yoder is not quite a reliable  source. Although the incident in Pennsylvania was reported as a breaking news story, it had allegedly occurred 20 months earlier (in April 1966). Dr. Yoder, blind from childhood due to an accident, had attended a lecture on the \"dangers of LSD\" in the autumn of 1967, and shortly afterwards he mentioned the story of the blinded students to Joseph Hunt, the commissioner of the Rehabilitation Service Administration, an office of the federal cabinet's Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Hunt asked Yoder for a written account of the incident, and Yoder complied by submitting actual case studies of six blind students (with the students' names covered over), all of whom were reportedly receiving state aid. This \"report\" was leaked to an Associated Press reporter who released it to the media on 13 January 1968, and outraged government officials took quick action. The next day the Federal Drug Administration announced it would conduct an investigation and prosecute the persons who had supplied LSD to the blinded students. On January 16, Pennsylvania state senator Benjamin R. Donolow and the press secretary for vacationing Pennsylvania governor Raymond P. Shafer both stated at news conferences that the story was true, as did Governor Shafer himself on January 17. Some sensible skeptics managed to make themselves heard, however. Ophthamologists expressed their doubts that even LSD could override self-preservation instincts long enough to keep a person's eyes focused on the sun until retinal tissues burned, or that such an occurrence could have remained unreported twenty months later.  And when investigators began to check on the case reports offered by Dr. Yoder, they found several damning inconsistencies: one of the \"victims\" had been receiving state aid since before April 1966, and another hadn't even been a student at the time of the alleged blindings.  Yoder admitted on January 18 that he had made the whole thing up because of his \"concern over illegal LSD use by children.\" The \"distraught and upset\" Commissioner Yoder was immediately suspended from his post as he checked himself into the Philadelphia Psychiatric Center, where he spent four weeks before being permanently removed from his position with the Welfare Department. (Although Dr. Norman Yoder is the name now mentioned whenever this story is discussed, the creation of this legend should be credited to the anonymous hoaxster[s] who had planted the \"blinded students\" articles in California newspapers eight months earlier.) As usual, the unraveling of the legend received far less attention from the press than its sensational outbreak had produced, and it remained a widely believed drug horror story throughout the next decade. (Newsweek reluctantly printed a tiny retraction in response to a reader who wrote them that \"the entire affair was the ill-conceived hoax of individuals who possibly share your zealotry for evoking before the public's terror-charged eyes the many perils presumably awaiting the hallucinogenic traveler.\")  Joel Fort provided an apt and succinct commentary on this legend in his 1969 book The Pleasure Seekers: \n\nNo instances of blindness have been shown to result from LSD use, but, of course, there are millions of blind people and hundreds of known causes of blindness which the public and press have shown much less concern about than the propaganda associating LSD with this severe disability. The propensity of the mass media uncritically to accept lurid and sensationalistic stories emanating from generally untrustworthy and uninformed government sources is probably far more dangerous to our social fabric than LSD. Printers' ink in one sense is the most dangerous chemical in use.\n\n Sightings:  In episode #36 of Dragnet 1967, Sgt.

Why isn't the mainstream media covering this? These two officers in Georgia have killed over 250 people in the line of duty. The officer on the left, Shane Walsh, has killed 41 people in the line of duty, before being killed in cold blood on a cold fall night by his very own partner and best friend on the right, Rick Grimes, back in late 2011. This was due to a custody dispute and argument over who was the better father and lover to Rick's wife, Lori Grimes, who slept with Deputy Walsh several times and was believed to be pregnant with Deputy Walsh's child as well. If that's not bad enough, Deputy Grimes is still allowed to keep his position as a Georgia full-time deputy sheriff and holds custody over his son Carl and his recently deceased wife Lori and Shane Walsh's child Judith.

        "justification": "In August 2020, a widely shared image claiming to depict a 392-year-old shark resurfaced on social media, garnering thousands of shares on both Facebook and Twitter. Facebook Twitter   This was a variation of a familiar meme, which we identified as \"mostly false\" in December 2018. We are rating the newer variation as \"mixture\" because the image that circulated in 2020 was, indeed, a photograph of a Greenland shark. However, we were unable to determine the exact age of the shark in question, though the age of a given Greenland shark can be estimated by its length (more on that later).  December 2018 Both viral memes originated from a study published in the journal Science in August 2016. In the study, researcher Julius Nielsen, who was then a Ph.D. student at the University of Copenhagen, set out to define the life history of the Greenland shark, scientifically known as Somniosus microcephalus. These deep ocean fish have been described as an \"iconic species of the Arctic seas\" and remain one of the most enigmatic creatures on Earth (see National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration picture below), mainly due to their unique ability to survive at depths of at least 7,200 feet. Science Julius Nielsen at least 7,200 feet   When the research was first announced in 2016, many mainstream media publications picked up the study and declared that the Greenland shark was the longest-lived vertebrate known on the planet. In the years following the publication of the study, various iterations of the photograph's subject and its age have recirculated in different forms. A reverse-image search found 56 results, dating back to as far as 2018. Following another round of social media virality, Nielsen took to Instagram in December 2017 to address misleading claims related to the age of the shark in question: media publications declared everse-image search Instagram Social media are going beserk over old Greenland sharks these days?? All of this is just the same story coming to life from August 2016 and please note that we have not found any sharks to be 600 or 500 yr old.... we have ESTIMATED (meaning that it has not been verified) that one shark was AT LEAST 272 yr old or in more detail that this shark was between 272-512 yr old with 95.5% certainty (the later also being an unverified estimate). Over the course of a three-year project to study the biology of the Greenland shark, the team used radiocarbon dating to determine the ages of 28 specimens that had been accidentally caught as by-catch over several years. The findings concluded that the slow-maturing species grows by about .4 inches each year, and can reach lengths stretching to over 16 feet. The largest shark analyzed in the study was measured at nearly 16.5-feet long, and was believed to have been around 392 years old in 2016  which would make her about 396 in August 2020. However, radiocarbon dating studies typically determine age ranges rather than point to a specific age. Based on the analysis of 28 female Greenland sharks  each of which measured between 2.5 and 16.5 feet long  the study authors estimated an average species lifespan of at least 272 years. If the estimates followed the annual growth of .4 inches to a tee, then one might calculate the largest shark to be 502 years old. Range estimates, on the other hand, showed that the largest shark was likely 392 years old, give or take 120 years.  A University of Copenhagen news release published at the time of the study described Greenland sharks as \"among the largest carnivorous sharks on the planet,\" whose role as an apex predator in the Arctic ecosystem is \"completely overlooked.\" Greenland sharks can reach lengths of up to 24 feet and weigh more than 2,000 pounds. news release What remains unclear is whether the shark featured in the meme was that same large shark mentioned above, or another one photographed as part of the research. So, while the photograph does, in fact, depict an individual, long-lived Greenland shark, the exact age of the specimen is not made readily clear in the research.

        ],
        "justification": "More than a century after the infamous sinking of the RMS Titanic, which resulted in the death of more than 1,500 passengers, the internet continues to obsess over the tragedy. Case in point: July 2022, a fake video shared to TikTok that claimed to show the sinking of the cruise liner racked up nearly a half-million likes. A caption accompanying the video read, Rare footage of the 1912 sinking of the Titanic. However, the video is a fake.   Titanic left its port of Southhampton, England, for its transatlantic maiden voyage on April 10, 1912. Four days later, the nearly 900-foot vessel collided with an iceberg near Newfoundland, Canada, at 11:40 p.m. Two hours and 40 minutes later, the vessel broke in two and sank, according to the Titanic Inquiry Project. Because many of its passengers were noteworthy individuals, the sinking of Titanic quickly became one of the first international news stories of the 20th-century  and along with it came a slew of misinformation, notes the Titanic Newspaper Archives. Newfoundland, Canada Titanic Inquiry Project Titanic Newspaper Archives Apparently, that legacy of misinformation has followed the wreckage 110 years later. The room that appears in the video presumably contains the Grand Staircase, which was described as one of the most impressive features on board the RMS Titanic and the center of first-class activity. James Camerons 1997 film classic \"Titanic\" resurfaced the fame of the centerpiece.  described Titanic  Public Domain Back to the TikTok video. How do we know that is is fake? First, listen to the audio. You can hear dramatic screaming in the background, but there are no visible people in the frames. Lets also mention that handheld video cameras werent a thing in 1912. Sure, cameras in the 1910s were more mobile than those of previous decades, but The Living Image vintage camera museum notes that cameras of this era [were] still mainly of wooden, folding construction  heavy and not easily mobile. There is surprisingly little genuine film footage of the Titanic both right before and after the disaster, but it does exist. British Path was a producer of newsreels throughout the 20th century, reported the pop-science website IFLScience. A six-minute newsreel produced in the aftermath of the disaster spans multiple scenes after the vessel sunk and the ensuing search for survivors. The first scenes from the footage below depict the Titanic as it left port for disaster. cameras in the 1910s notes British Path IFLScience the vessel sunk  As you can see, authentic film footage from 1912 is much different than the clips shared to TikTok. Lastly, we checked the Instagram account associated with the TikTok profile. It led us to a person presumably named Taylor Tituss, who has a description in the profile reading, I make video edits for fun.  Taylor Tituss \"So, to clear things up, the video is fake,\" Tituss told Snopes, adding that he took the footage from a YouTube clip posted to the platform in May 2021. A caption accompanying the video, which had over 1.5 million views as of this writing, claimed the following:  Mr Joseph Davies a 17 year old boy who was a Photographer on the Titanic the day it perished down in the Atlantic ocean in 1912.This footage was recovered in 2020 by a historian Investigating the sinking of the titanic.He commented \"A camera was found in the Atlantic ocean where the titanic sits to rest. It was a miracle the camera was still intact after it was found in 1989.\"\"After years and years of trying to recover the footage found in the films, they were unsuccessful until in 2020 when they became successful recovering the footage using state of the art technology.\" Mr Joseph died during the sinking of the titanic, the end bit where the video cuts out is when Mr Joseph drowned to his death trying to capture the sinking of the titanic. His remains were never found. We previously fact-checked the claim that an \"old camera\" from the Titanic was found deep in the ocean. That's also false, as is the below video: \"old camera  As we previously reported, a young girl named Bernice Palmer did capture photographs of the iceberg  that Titanic collided with, as well as images of survivors. The Natural Museum of American History published that Palmer carried a handheld camera on the ship that responded to the Titanics distress call: reported published In 1900, the Eastman Kodak Company came out with the handheld box camera known as the Brownie. An immediate hit, more than 100,000 were sold in its first year. Canadian Bernice Bernie Palmer received a Kodak Brownie box camera, either for Christmas 1911 or for her birthday on January 10th, 1912. In early April, Bernie and her mother boarded the Cunard liner Carpathia in New York, for a Mediterranean cruise. Carpathia had scarcely cleared New York, when it received a distress call from the White Star liner Titanic on 14 April. It raced to the scene of the sinking and managed to rescue over 700 survivors from the icy North Atlantic. With her new camera, Bernice took pictures of the iceberg that sliced open the Titanics hull below the waterline and also took snapshots of some of the Titanic survivors.

It does not appear in the transcript of the event, nor can Clinton be heard speaking this phrase during the broadcast.  transcript broadcast It seems to have originated with a social media user named Rocky Raczkowski, who (according to his post) was not directly quoting Clinton, but was giving his interpretation of what he thought Clinton had said in response to a question about Supreme Court justices: Rocky Raczkowski   Raczkowski's interpretation was later shared by Mike Hewitt, a politician and radio show host, who posted the message as if it were a direct quote from Clinton, while darkly hinting at a media so corrupt that they refused to cover the what she had really said: message   Of course, the reason that most media sources did not report on this quote is that it is not a quote, but a highly subjective (and inaccurate) interpretation of her words. Here's Clinton's actual response to a question about how she would select a Supreme Court justice, which is nothing like the questionable paraphrase offered by Raczkowski and shared by Hewitt: QUESTION: Good evening. Perhaps\n the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice? RADDATZ: We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. Well, youre right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against. Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesnt agree with that. I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we dont always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a womans right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality. Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards. I want a Supreme Court that doesnt always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because youre wealthy and you can give more money to something doesnt mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else. So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, theyve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty. I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.

As this claim circulated on social media, we started receiving queries asking if Trump supporters were truly sharing the image. One reader even asked if it had been shared by the RNC:  Is the RNC really posting this image of Charles Manson and Donald Trump photoshopped together to appear as if Manson is Jesus endorsing Trump? While it's certainly possible that a handful of Trump supporters have shared this image by accident, we found no record of it being shared on the social media pages of the Republican National Convention, the White House, or the GOP. While we have not perused the accounts of every elected Republican lawmaker, we can say that we have not encountered any high-profile Republican accounts sharing the image in earnest, nor any postings by Trump's supporters that were widely shared on social media.  Republican National Convention White House GOP The image of Manson and Trump appears to be a manipulated version of a painting that originally showed Trump and Jesus entitled \"You are not Alone\" that was uploaded to Fine Art America by Danny Hahlbohm on May 28, 2020. Here's a look at the original painting (left) and the manipulated version (right): Fine Art America   A third version of this painting was also circulated on social media. This alternate version, however, also depicts Jesus standing behind Trump, not Manson. Hahlbohm confirmed to us in an email that he was the artist behind this alternate version, explaining that this was just an earlier version of his painting he had since revised.  A third version of this painting Here's a comparison of Hahlbohm's painting from Fine Art America (left) and the earlier version (right): Fine Art America   To sum up: A painting of Jesus standing behind Trump was digitally altered to make it appear as if Trump were being watched over by cult leader Manson, not Jesus. While the Trump / Manson image went viral along with the claim that it was unknowingly being shared by Trump supporters, we could find no popular instances of Trump supporters sharing the Manson image in earnest.

While this image is often shared as if it shows all of the churches that were \"destroyed\" in France, this map actually documents a wide range of nefarious activity, such as vandalism, theft, and arson, that occurred at both churches and cemeteries over an apparent span of two years (not four), covering 2017 and 2018. christianophobie.fr It should also be noted that while this map does document some relatively serious crimes, such as arson or the toppling of church statues, many of these pins correspond to graffiti-related incidents. We also found one pin related to a person's simply interrupting a church service. This map does not show churches that have been destroyed in France. However, it does correspond with what French authorities have reported concerning vandalism at places of worship in the country. Newsweek reported in March 2019 that France had seen a \"spate of attacks\" against Catholic churches: Newsweek France has seen a spate of attacks against Catholic churches since the start of the year, vandalism that has included arson and desecration. Vandals have smashed statues, knocked down tabernacles, scattered or destroyed the Eucharist and torn down crosses, sparking fears of a rise in anti-Catholic sentiment in the country. In March 2019, France's central criminal intelligence service, SCRC, reported that there were approximately 875 acts of vandalism against Catholic churches in 2018. The Ministry of the Interior came to a similar conclusion. Ministry of the Interior The Ministry of the Interior released a report in February 2019 that tallied the number of acts of degradation (or vandalism) against various religious establishments. The Ministry found that there were 1,063 anti-Christian acts in 2018 (approximately 700 of which related to property crimes and 100 of which related to violent acts), 541 anti-semitic acts (81 of which were related to violence, 102 related to property crimes), and 100 anti-Muslim acts. The Ministry stated that one reason churches were targeted more frequently than the places of worship of other religions was that France simply had more churches. France is home to approximately 40,000 churches: stated 40,000 churches \"The ministry also said that the large number of degrades to Christian sites was partly explained by the higher number of churches compared to the places of worship of the other two religions.\" The Ministry noted that attacks on Muslims were at their lowest levels since 2010, attacks on Christians were at the same level as the previous year, and that attacks on the Jewish community rose in 2018. Christophe Castaner, minister of the interior, condemned acts of hate against all religious people and places of worship.  \"Hate has no place in the Republic. We are determined to protect all French people, to protect secularism, the freedom not to believe, as to believe in respect, in complete safety. These numbers show that we must not let our guard down. Anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, anti-Christian, racist, xenophobic: there is no small attack, no small insult.

But, I searched here and didn't find anything related...  \n There is something being shared on FB that Play Station 4's are being given away due to the boxes not being sealed and they are asking everyone to share them and comment (done).\n Origins:  A common Facebook scam that entices users  to like, share, and promote a Facebook page through staging what appears to be a massive giveaway targeted PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 users in November 2014. Though the exact details vary from scam page to scam page, the basic premise remains the same: Under a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5-related name, the scammers post images of stacked, partially-wrapped consoles and state a large number (generally 200) of those units cannot be sold because they were \"unsealed.\" Claiming to have already given away a few dozen units, the pages promise a larger number of PlayStations remain to be distributed for free if users simply like the page, share it with friends, and comment \"done.\" While Sony has never engaged in such a giveaway, and the Facebook pages' affiliations are never made clear (nor is there ever a reason given for how the page operators acquired thousands upon thousands of dollars of desirable electronic goods), the lure of a free PlayStation is often enough to induce Facebook users to put their reservations aside and participate. Images from the PlayStation giveaways are provably inaccurately attributed. A reverse image search reveals one common image used in the PlayStation giveaway scam actually depicts consoles stacked for distribution following a release in 2013: \n\nGreatness has arrived.

        "justification": "On Nov. 28, 2022, the@Xx17965797N Twitter accounttweeteda video with a misleading caption that claimed the clip showed a sea of lined-up electric scooter bikes that were abandoned because of the high cost of electric vehicle (EV) battery replacement. The tweet read, \"Electric green scooters that have reached end of battery life. Due to the batteries being so expensive to replace, electric scooters are abandoned because disposing of them any other way is dangerous and expensive.\" tweeted This was not true, despite the tens of thousands of combined retweets and likes that the tweet received.  The same video upload from @Xx17965797N was also misleadingly reshared by accounts including@PeterDClack, @JamesMelville, and @MillerForTexas. The former two tweets received thousands of engagements, despite the fact that the information pushed in the original tweet was not true. @PeterDClack @JamesMelville @MillerForTexas In cases like these where a caption is incorrect but the picture or video is real, we issue a fact-check rating of \"Miscaptioned.\" Days before the @Xx17965797N tweet was posted, the@ElevaBrasilES account also misleadingly tweeted that the same video was shot in France. The tweet went up on Nov. 21 with an incorrect caption that read, \"Green energy Cemetery of electric motorcycles in France. Now designated as a 'biohazard zone.'\" (Note: This mention of France reminded us of other rumors we've debunked in the past, in particular about two photosof other car graveyards. The two pictures showed false captions that claimed the cars had been abandoned due to the high cost of battery replacement, just like the video we're looking at in this fact check.) tweeted two photos The oldest upload of the video that we could find came from TikTok user @smartsetting. The video was uploaded on Nov. 7 and by the end of the month had received nearly 5 million views.   Based on watching the video, the scooters appeared to be parked in a parking lot near a basketball court, perhaps in a university complex or public park. Several blurry Chinese characters were visible on the side of the bikes. At the end of the clip, a tall building could be seen on the right-hand side of the frame. Other than those pieces of information, we didn't have much to go on. In order to find the truth behind this video, we first used Adobe Media Encoder to export a JPEG file for each and every frame from the video. The results of this export were 440 individual images from the 14-second video. We then performed numerous reverse image searches with these picture files using Google Images and TinEye.com. These reverse image searches provided several clues as to where other users had reposted the video. However, we did not find any further details from these searches. Next, we tried several searches on Google, Twitter, and YouTube with phrases such as \"electric scooter China\" and \"electric bike graveyard China,\" among other terms. This helped to find several repostsof the video. The searches alsoshowedresults for many of the sites in China that are the final resting placesfor massive stacks of bicycles dumped by bike-sharing companies with failed business models. Perhaps the most striking video we found was titled, \"No Place To PlaceThe Wonders of Shared Bicycle Graveyards in China.\" several reposts showed results sites final resting places failed business models video At one point in our research, we stumbled upon an AFP videofrom 2021 that appeared to show the same yellow color and model of electric scooter bike. The caption for the clip said that it was captured \"outside the city of Shenyang.\" The end of the video showed a stadium with special colors for seating zones. video model After an exhaustive search, we were able to find this same stadium by using the map tools on the Chinese website Baidu.com. Unlike Google Maps, Baidu.com has street-level views of nearby roads. However, this part of our effort wasn't very helpful. It remained unclear if this was the same location where the viral clip was shot. Baidu.com In the end, it was going back to TikTok that helped us find the origins of the video. A search on TikTok for \"electric share bike China\" brought us to this video from @evstevepan. The video showed the same kind of yellow electric scooter bike with a similar logo. A scan of the logo using a mobile phone camera and Google Translate revealed the company name Meituan, which is known as an \"all-encompassing platform for local services.\" this video We then searched the internet for Meituan and electric scooters, which produced plenty of pictures on Shutterstock.com. For a moment, the two large characters on the side of the scooter didn't seem to match those from the viral video. We then horizontally flipped a still-frame from the viral video, which led us to discover that it had been mirrored, meaning that all words and numbers were backward. plenty of pictures All of these developments in our research led us to news articles that helped to show our findings were lining up. In April 2018, news broke that Meituan had purchased the company Mobike for $2.7 billion. According to the story, Mobike is \"a Chinese startup that helped pioneer bike-sharing services worldwide.\" broke But by November of that same year, TechCrunch reported that Meituan would be \"[walking] away from bike-sharing and ride-hailing,\" as there wasn't enough demand from customers for the supply of its bike-sharing venture: reported In April, Meituan entered the bike-sharing fray after it scooped up top player Mobike for $2.7 billion to face off Alibaba-backed Ofo. Over the past few years, Mobike and Ofo were burning through large sums of investor money in a bid to win users from subsidized rides, but both have shown signs of softening their stance recently. Mobike is downsizing its fleets to \"avoid an oversupply\" as the bike-sharing market falters, Meituan's chief financial officer Chen Shaohui said during the earnings call. Ofo has also scaled back by closing down many of its international operations. ... During its third quarter that ended September 30, Meituan posted a 97.2 percent jump on revenues to 19.1 billion yuan, or $2.75 billion, on the back of strong growth in food delivery transactions. The firm's investments in new initiatives  including ride-hailing and bike-sharing  took a toll as operating losses nearly tripled to 3.45 billion yuan compared to a year ago. Meituan shares plunged as much as 14 percent on Friday, the most since its spectacular listing. Just as so many electric bicycles from bike-sharing companies had piled up across China, so had electric scooters like the ones seen in the viral video. In sum, social media users falsely claimed that a video showed tons of lined-up electric scooter bikes that were abandoned in a \"graveyard\" due to the high cost of EV battery replacement. All evidence pointed to a simple answer: supply and demand. The number of electric scooter bikes and bicycles far outnumbered the number of people who requested to use them (or else they went missing or were stolen), which resulted in downsizing by some companies, and the closure of others.The clip appears to have been shot in China, although its precise location is unclear. far outnumbered went missing or were stolen We reached out to Meituan for comment on Nov. 29 but did not receive a response in time for publication. 25  2022 .

Jadi kakak aku bikin ginian (unggahan di Facebook) buat bercandaan doang sama teman-teman toys lovernya,\" kata Octavia saat dikonfirmasi kumparan, Jumat (13/10/2017). Octavia dan kakaknya tidak menyangka unggahan ini akan viral di Facebook dan banyak orang yang percaya. Padahal awalnya hanya untuk bercanda. Kakak saya hanya bikin postnya saja buat joke satir sama teman-teman komunitasnya. Tapi ternyata terus tembus 5,5 ribu share karena orang pada percaya,\" kata Octavia. Menurut Octavia, kakaknya mendapatkan foto boneka itu dari rekannya sesama penggemar mainan. Keduanya bertemu dalam forum Toyslover Planet 12. The photograph is not a real baby, but just a doll. \"It's a silicon doll my sister uploaded to Facebook to share with her friends who love toys,\" confirmed Octavia, Friday (13/10/2017). Octavia and her sister did not expect this upload to go viral on Facebook and that so many people would believe it. Initially, it was intended as a joke. \"My sister made a post just to joke with her friends, but it kept going with 5.5 thousand shares because people believed it,\" said Octavia. According to Octavia, her sister got the doll photo from her fellow toy fans. They met in the Toyslover Planet 12 forum. These images show a silicon doll that was created by Italian artist Laira Maganuco. These images were featured on her Etsy page in a listing for a \"baby Licantropo,\" or baby werewolf, doll. Maganuco also posted images showing the creation of this \"baby Licantropo\" to her Facebook page: featured Facebook   The images were originally shared with the claim that this creature was the result of a human mating with a lioness. Although scientists are experimenting with various chimeras, it is generally thought that creating human-animal hybrids is virtually impossible: impossible In general, two types of changes prevent animals from interbreeding. The first includes all those factorscalled pre-zygotic reproductive isolating mechanismsthat would make fertilization impossible. After so many generations apart, a pair of animals might look so different from one another that theyre not inclined to have sex. If the animals do try to get it on despite changed appearances, incompatible genitalia or sperm motility could pose another problem: A human spermatozoon may not be equipped to navigate the reproductive tract of a chimpanzee, for example. The second type of barrier includes post-zygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms, or those factors that would make it impossible for a hybrid animal fetus to grow into a reproductive adult. If a human were indeed inclined and able to impregnate a monkey, post-zygotic mechanisms might result in a miscarriage or sterile offspring. The further apart two animals are in genetic terms, the less likely they are to produce viable offspring. At this point, humans seem to have been separate from other animals for far too long to interbreed. We diverged from our closest extant relative, the chimpanzee, as many as 7 million years ago. (For comparison, our apparent tryst with the Neanderthals occurred less than 700,000 years after we split off from them.) Bosch, Torie.  \"We Mated with Neanderthals.

            "A single, unverified Facebook post is never a good reason to panic. "
        ],
        "justification": "In March 2019, a number of social media users encountered a piece of text warning them to be extra cautious in public bathrooms because intravenous drug users purportedly were known to clean their needles by sticking them into rolls of toilet paper:   I took a HAZWOP class about 6 months ago and ever since then I always look at the toilet paper roll in a porta potty or public restroom before deciding to do my business. The instructor warned us about intravenous drug users cleaning their needles by stabbing the dirty needle into the roll of toilet paper to clean the blood off of the tip. This photograph and text was originally shared by Facebook user Gavin Aubert. The post racked up hundreds of thousands of shares, but was ultimately deleted after it attracted bots that flooded the comments section with spammy links. We managed to get in contact with Aubert's wife, who told us that her husband truly wrote the text, and that the photograph had been taken at a KFC in Federal Way, Washington.  deleted While Aubert may be relaying something he actually heard during a HAZWOPER class  Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response is a set of guidelines set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  that does not mean that this practice is widespread. A spokesperson for OSHA told us that the organization had not heard of this practice. We received a similar response from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The Institute told us that concerned citizens should check with their local public health departments for more information, but, generally speaking, the organization had no evidence that drug users were cleaning needles by stabbing them into toilet paper rolls in public bathrooms.  A spokesperson for the Washington State Department of Health said that they were also unaware of any reports of drug users cleaning needles by sticking them into toilet paper rolls: We have never heard of this. This practice seems extremely unlikely because the tip of the needle could break off if one tried to stab it through a toilet paper roll. I'm not sure why someone would risk that if what they wanted was to use the same needle for another shot. Logically it would be much easier to wipe off the tip with some toilet paper rather than stabbing it through the roll. Here is the info on how someone would properly clean a needle/syringe. info That said, the best public health practice endorsed by CDC and the US Public Health Service is to use a new sterile needle/syringe for every injection. We reached out to the Federal Way Police Department but did not hear back by press time. As noted by the Washington Health Department, the method described in this viral Facebook post is not effective in cleaning a needle. Health officials also say drug users should never share needles as it puts them at risk of getting or transmitting disease such as hepatitis or HIV. HarmReduction.org also recommends against re-using needles in general: HarmReduction.org The only to definite way to avoid disease transmission of this sort is to never share needles, syringes, or other injection equipment. It is therefore extremely important for every injector to have his or her own set of works, and an ample supply of needles and syringes so that they never have to share or re-use their ownbut especially othersinjection equipment. Cleaning needles and syringes is a complicated process that, even if done according to the best scientific advice currently available, is not a 100% fool-proof method of avoiding harmful bacteria, viruses, and other blood-borne pathogens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that drug users can reduce the risk of HIV by cleaning their needles in bleach, but this method still does not completely eliminate the risk. The CDC suggests that drug users find a local syringe service program (SSP) to obtain free sterile needles: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The best way to reduce the risk of getting or transmitting HIV through injection drug use is to stop injecting drugs. Talk with a counselor, doctor, or other health care provider about substance use disorder treatment, including medication-assisted treatment. To find a treatment center near you, check out the locator tools on Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) or www.hiv.gov, or call 1-800-662-HELP (4357). If you continue injecting drugs, never share needles or works. Many communities have syringe services programs (SSPs) where you can get free sterile needles and syringes and safely dispose of used ones. They can also refer you to substance use disorder treatment and help you get tested for HIV and hepatitis. Contact your local health department or North American Syringe Exchange Network (NASEN) to find an SSP. Also, some pharmacies may sell needles without a prescription. Other things you can do to lower your risk of getting or transmitting HIV, if you continue to inject drugs, include: Cleaning used needles with bleach. This may reduce the risk of HIV but doesn't eliminate it. In short, rumors about intravenous drug users cleaning their needles by stabbing them into rolls of toilet paper in public bathrooms were based on a single, unverified Facebook post. As of this writing, we have not encountered any evidence to suggest that this practice is widespread.    Are Fentanyl Users Cleaning Needles by Poking Toilet Paper Rolls?

Although that particular warning came in late 2014, rumors about adverse pet reactions to  Facebook EverPet brand cat and dog food (commonly sold at Dollar General stores) have circulated on the internet since at least as far back as 2010. It is not uncommon to find stories on social media attributing a pet's death to a particular brand of cat or dog food, as people  brand who have experienced the untimely loss of a beloved animal companion attempt to spare other families the trauma they have endured. Similar warnings have circulated about brands such as Purina, with grieving owners similarly convinced the food their pet consumed was responsible for the animal's illness or death. Purina In the absence of confirmation or denial from Dollar General, well-intentioned pet owners seized on anecdotal information about the brand on the web, but the owner of the dog referenced above later admitted that the pet's death had not been linked to EverPet: \n \n\n Unlike Purina, discount brand EverPet has no dedicated website or social media presence where they address such complaints.

        "justification": "A few days before the release of \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,\" a movie starring Tom Hanks about children's television host Fred Rogers, a representative for Ancestry.com told CBS News that the two men were related: CBS News Tom Hanks bears a shocking resemblance to children's television star Fred Rogers, who he plays in the upcoming film \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.\" But the similarities are more than just good casting  the performers are actually related, according to a discovery made by Ancestry.com. Hanks is sixth cousins with Rogers, and they share the same great-great-great-great-great grandfather, Johannes Mefford, a company representative told CBS News. The company utilized its database of over 20 billion online historical records to form Hanks' family tree, the representative said. We have no reason to doubt Ancestry.com's claim. However, some readers may not quite understand just how distant a distant cousin really is.  The genealogy website reported that Rogers and Hanks are sixth cousins who share a 5x great-grandfather (or a great-great-great-great-great-grandfather). Here's how Ancestry.com described Hanks relationship to Rogers:    Fred Rogers and Tom Hanks are sixth cousins sharing the same 5x great-grandfather, Johannes Mefford, who immigrated from Germany to America in the 18th century. Johannes raised a family of patriots; three of his sons (including Tom Hanks and Fred Rogerss ancestors) served in the Revolutionary War. Fred Rogerss 4x great-grandfather, William Mefford, served in the navy and was captured by the British in 1782. He endured life on a prison ship in Barbados and Antigua until he was released ten months later. Tom Hankss 4x great-grandfather, Jacob Mefford, joined the War as a private and participated in a skirmish at Chesapeake Bay. So, Rogers and Hanks not only share the same ancestor, they also descend from two brothers who fought for Americas independence. While it may be \"true\" to say that Hanks and Rogers are related, phrasing their relationship this way is a bit misleading.  We found varying estimates about just how closely related sixth cousins really are, but the general conclusion was that these \"relatives\" were very distant. For instance, a study by Ancestry DNA in 2014, based on British birth rates and census data, found that the average person in Britain had about 175,000 sixth cousins.  found While it's true that Hanks and Rogers are related, they are distant cousins who probably don't share much in terms of DNA. But don't let that take away from Hanks' performance as Rogers in \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\":  We reached out to the Association of Professional Genealogists and the International Society of Genetic Genealogy. We will update this article when more information becomes available.

The filings indicate that two factors provided the lion share of Amazons reduced federal tax liability: $220 million worth of tax credits, and $917 million in tax-deductible executive pay derived from the sale of stocks:   The third negative item in the SEC filing, $789 million in reduced tax burden as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, will be applied to future tax years, according to a report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. report SEC filings do not require a company to list the specific credits they utilize, but there are several avenues Amazon would likely have pursued. Annette Nellen, a professor and director of the Master of Science in Taxation program at San Jose University, said that Amazons write-offs likely include credits for research and development, domestic production, and equipment depreciation. And according to a report from the Economic Policy Institute, Amazon receives myriad tax incentives from state and local governments as well: said report \nThe expansion of Amazons physical distribution network has coincided with a strategic business plan of negotiating millions in tax abatements, credits, exemptions, and infrastructure assistance from state and local governments in the name of regional economic development. By the end of 2016, Amazon had likely received over $1 billion in state and local subsidies for its facilities, which would include not only fulfillment centers but sortation centers that only sort packages, mailing centers, and other facilities.\n Publicly-traded corporations can list the stock options they grant to employees as a business cost in their accounting, and if an option-receiving employee makes over $1 million a year in salary, the profits from the sale of those stocks can be then counted as a federal income tax deduction for the corporation (primarily due to a Clinton-era compromise over how to cap executive pay). Stock options allow an employee to purchase stock in their employers company at a set price, regardless of its current market value: list \nOptions give executives and investors the right to buy shares of a company at a later date and at specific prices. For example, if a chief executive joins a media company when its stock is trading at $55 a share, but years later, the share price has skyrocketed to $100, that chief executive can still buy the shares at $55, pocketing the massive difference.\n In the cases of their highest paid employees, Amazon and other companies are able to deduct the massive difference employees make when they sell that stock at a profit. According to the Center for Tax Justice, because companies typically low-ball the estimated values, they usually end up with much bigger tax write-offs than the amounts they deduct as a 'cost' in computing the profits they report to shareholders. The $917 million in stock-based compensation listed in Amazon's SEC filing likely stems from their top employees' cashing in on their stock options for a large profit. deduct While it is impossible to know the exact amount of money Amazon did or did not pay to the federal government in 2017, their own accounting suggests that they expected their federal corporate income tax burden to be negative that year.

FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, April 2015] \nPhoto looks unreal, says \"Fb\" will donate $1 for each share of photo showing baby born with heart outside of its body.\n  Origins:  In April 2015, an image urging viewers to share a photograph of a baby born with his heart outside his body in order raise funds for his medical care was circulated widely via Facebook. But neither the image nor its claim was new; the tandem was simply a reiteration of a hoax that had circulated more than a year earlier involving the same photograph and plea. This \"raise money for a child's medical care by sharing this photo on Facebook\" format of hoax is common: Previous variations include a child purportedly shot  by a family member, a toddler who needed shot a heart transplant, and a little girl from Poland in desperate need of money for burn treatment. heart transplant burn treatment As is often the case with these popular social media hoaxes, the image used was one of a real child suffering a real medical condition, and that image was deliberately selected with the intent of tugging at the heartstrings of Facebook users for purposes unconnected to the depicted child's recovery or well being. The photograph used in this case is one that was widely reproduced in conjunction with 2012 news coverage about the case of Hayes Davis, who was born with omphalocele, a birth defect in which the fetus' intestines and other abdominal organs stick out from the belly button: news coverage \n\nAfter a pregnancy with seemingly endless appointments and ultrasounds, [Kelly] Davis gave birth to Hayes March 25, 2011, via Cesarean section at Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, Tx. \"I was so excited to meet him, but the anxiety was almost overwhelming,\" the new mom said. \"I didn't know if he would breathe on his own or eat on his own or whether the omphalocele would stay intact.\"\n In January 2012, doctors successfully corrected Davis' condition: \n\nAfter his mom spent months treating the condition and even documenting her world on her blog, \"O Baby,\" Hayes underwent surgery to correct the organs. \"The surgery went perfectly,\" Davis said. \"Both surgeons were incredibly pleased. We're looking forward to a simpler way of life.\"\n Images such as the one of the \"baby born with his heart outside his body\" are carefully selected by Facebook scammers preying on the sympathies of social media users.\nMany folks believe that sharing the image is harmless: If the claim is true, the baby is helped; and if it's false, only a small amount of their time was wasted. But these types of hoaxes are typically lures for the distribution of malware as well as clickjacking, clickbaiting, and like-farming activities, made all the more reprehensible for their dishonest and unauthorized use of such photographs.

        "justification": "In the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the U.S. Capitol, right-wing conspiracy theorists and internet users began to share a letter, supposedly written by Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Ted Wheeler, mayor of Portland, Oregon. The letter appeared to encourage Wheeler to \"stick to the proven Democratic play book\" and \"blame Trump\" for civil unrest in the city in August 2020. share unrest   The letter was dated Aug. 27, 2020, and read as follows: Dear Mr. Wheeler,  I have seen your response to the riots in your city and I am urging you to stick to the proven Democratic Play book. I would like to review this with you now.\n1. Deny there is a Problem. (Press will support this)\n2. Refer to everything as peaceful and calm. (Press will help here also)\n3. When all hell breaks loose, go on camera and show your support for anybody breaking the law. (Press will praise you for this, you will be a new hero, trust me).\n4. When you can no longer keep any order \"BLAME TRUMP!\" (I cannot over emphasize #4, This has worked every time we have used it and again the Press has told me they will support and fact check any claim we make!! THIS IS POLITICAL GOLD!!)\n5. Go on Television and Condemn TRUMP and refuse any assistance! We CANNOT give TRUMP any victory before the election!!!!! Many of those who shared the letter claimed additionally that it had been obtained from a laptop stolen from Pelosi during the riots. One widely shared screenshot indicated that the letter had also been shared on the social media website Parler by the controversial pro-Trump attorney Lin Wood. claimed additionally obtained indicated controversial pro-Trump On Jan. 10, Google and Apple removed Parler from their app stores, and Amazon removed the site from its online platform, meaning we could not access Wood's Parler posts at the time of this writing, so we can't verify whether he did share the Pelosi letter. removed However, we do know the letter was fake. First of all, it bore several prima-facie hallmarks of being inauthentic: the informal style and tone (\"stick to the proven Democratic Play book\"); the scattered use of all caps (\"THIS IS POLITICAL GOLD!!\"); frequent deployment of exclamation marks; inappropriate capitalization (\"Play book\" and \"Problem\") and inappropriate lack of capitalization (\"best wishes\"). Those traits immediately marked the letter as being more akin to a hyper-partisan Facebook post than formal written correspondence between the speaker of the U.S. House and the mayor of a major American city. On Jan. 6, Capitol rioters did steal a laptop from a conference room used by the speaker of the House. However, Pelosi's Deputy Chief of Staff Drew Hamill quickly clarified on Twitter that the laptop was used only for giving presentations. In an email sent to Snopes, Hamill explained that not only was the letter fake, but the laptop in question would not have allowed anyone access to Pelosi's personal, private correspondence in the first place. clarified Furthermore, a spokesperson for Wheeler confirmed for Snopes that the Portland mayor had never received any letter from Pelosi that matched the content of the one shared widely in January 2021.  Those dual attestations, combined with the unavailability of evidence to authenticate the letter, and the existence of convincing indications that it was not written by Pelosi, mean we are issuing a rating of False.",

            "Here's the lowdown about the Facebook warnings regarding NameDrop, an iPhone feature that debuted with the September 2023 release of iOS 17."
        ],
        "justification": "In late November 2023, Facebook users shared variations of a viral warning about a relatively new iPhone feature called NameDrop, also known as \"Bringing Devices Together.\" The posts hinted that NameDrop, dubbed by Apple as \"a new AirDrop experience,\" was dangerous, and said that users needed to take action to protect their privacy and security. Multiple U.S. police department Facebook pages also shared the warnings, which perhaps was one of the reasons that we received so many reader emails about this rumor. U.S. police department Facebook pages We reviewed multiple versions of the same warning about NameDrop on iPhone devices. One such warning read as follows: warning IMPORTANT PRIVACY UPDATE: If you have an iPhone and have done the recent iOS 17 update, they have set a new feature called NameDrop defaulted to ON. This feature allows the sharing of your contact info just by bringing your phones close together. While you do need to accept the transfer, if you would prefer to shut this off go to: Settings, General, AirDrop, Bringing Devices Together. Change to OFF. PARENTS: You may consider changing these settings after the update on your childrens phones, also, to help keep them safe as well! Despite the virality of these warnings, here's the truth: These posts are based on a misunderstanding of how the NameDrop feature works with an iPhone, just like so many other technological scares that in past years were also virally shared on Facebook. Barring the possibility of any future security holes being uncovered by users, the NameDrop feature was designed with multiple layers of protection. NameDrop is a feature that allows two users to hold their iPhone devices very close to each other in order to share a phone number or email address. This also works with an iPhone and an Apple Watch or two Apple Watches. NameDrop Basically, instead of asking a friend for their contact details or handing your device to a friend to have them input their information, NameDrop allows this exchange of basic data to happen in a much easier, yet still secure, manner. The feature was first included in the software update known as iOS 17. It released in September 2023 after being announced in June. iOS 17 announced  Apple says that, for NameDrop to work, users' devices must be \"within a few centimeters\" of each other to initiate the first step of the process. Also, both users must be signed into iCloud. Users can then select if they want to share their phone number or email address and must tap a \"Share\" button to complete the exchange of one of the two pieces of basic contact data. To be clear, no contact information is automatically shared when two devices are brought together without a user taking action. Further, NameDrop does not work unless the devices are already unlocked. Think of the following scenario: You sit down in a cozy coffee shop with your phone in your purse or on the table. Another customer is sitting several tables away. That other customer isn't going to be able to initiate the NameDrop feature on your phone because the devices are further apart than the \"within a few centimeters\" of proximity specified by Apple. Even if that other customer walks by and bumps into the purse or your phone on the table, if your phone is locked with a passcode or other security feature, they couldn't even begin initiating the NameDrop feature. Further, even if your phone is unlocked, you would still have to tap some buttons in order for the person to receive your contact details. In other words, there are multiple layers of security that were implemented for the NameDrop feature that are meant to protect users. The only way a person could misuse the NameDrop feature on your phone is if they take your unlocked phone away from you without your permission and initiate the sharing of contact information. However, this does not make the NameDrop feature unsafe. It simply means that you need to not allow strangers to take your unlocked phone away from you. All of the data we've detailed above led us to our rating of False, meaning that, as the authoritative tech blog Wired.com put it in the headline of their article, \"No, You Dont Need to Turn Off Apples NameDrop Feature in iOS 17.\" article If users, including parents, still wish to turn off the NameDrop feature, simply navigate on an iPhone to \"Settings,\" \"General\" and then \"AirDrop.\" To disable NameDrop, toggle the \"Bringing Devices Together\" feature to off. This screenshot shows NameDrop (\"Bringing Devices Together\") enabled.

        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Trapped miners gave their oxygen to one of their number, a young father, who survived. \nStatus:  Multiple  see below.\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, 2006] \n\n\nI am sure everyone is aware of the mining tragedy in Buckhannon. I work in Buckhannon and the lady who cleans our office was in here late last night as I was still working.  She came in very excited that someone was still here so she could share some good news surrounding this incident.  I though it was incredibly inspiring, touching, and worth sharing as a testament to God's purpose in all things. She had a couple relatives who died in the  accident, and she knew the family and young man who survived.  Randall McCloy apparently has a young family and small children, and those fellow miners who were trapped with him made the decision at least in part to give their oxygen to this young man so he could survive to raise his family.  According to her there are notes in several of the deceased miners lunch boxes describing their decision.  Her comment was that she knew several of them and that some weren't right with the Lord, but her belief is that the Lord, working in ways we cannot comprehend, opened an opportunity for them to open their hearts to God, and then make an extreme sacrifice of love for another. I was in awe at this story of self-sacrifice, and know that this could only be the work of the Lord for such a thing to happen.  My hope is that the media, so caught  up in tragedy chasing, latches onto this inspirational story as fast as they do the opportunity to report about the death, loss, and other surrounding travails of this situation.\n Origins:  On 2 January 2006, parts of the Sago Mine in West Virginia collapsed, leaving unknown the fate of thirteen miners trapped by the accident. Rescuers did not reach these men until almost two days later, at which time it was discovered twelve of  the miners had perished, eleven of suffocation and one from injuries received in the  blast. The lone survivor, Randal McCloy, was treated for carbon monoxide poisoning and organ damage. His family elected for him to receive hyperbaric therapy, the same treatment given to scuba divers suffering from the bends: Patients breathe 100 percent oxygen (room air is 21 percent oxygen) in a chamber where the atmospheric pressure is two to three times normal to help the oxygen penetrate tissues it cannot reach under normal conditions. To effect this treatment, McCloy was kept in a medically-induced coma.  While this 26-year-old father of two struggled to recover, speculation regarding the possible reasons for his being the only survivor of this mining disaster remained unanswered.  One theory asserted the other miners, knowing that all would perish otherwise, shared oxygen from their self-rescuers with McCloy: \n\n[The Daily Telegraph, 2006] The miner's father, Randal McCloy Sr, said that he believed \"in his heart\" that his son's mostly 50-something colleagues decided during their last, desperate hours to share their dwindling oxygen supply with his son because he was the youngest of the group and had two young children.  [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 2006] Ms. McCloy [Randal McCloy's wife] said she would not be surprised to learn, as friends and family have begun to speculate, that his fellow miners sacrificed some of their oxygen supply to save him when they were trapped underground together following an explosion Monday. \"I figure they thought of Randy as one of their sons and wanted to take care of him,\" she said.\n Final messages in the form of scribbled  notes to loved ones were found on some of the miners, but none of their contents (as released to the media) made mention of oxygen being donated to McCloy.  notes Several months after the accident, when Randal McCloy was sufficiently recovered to release a statement, the story he told was the opposite of the one presented above: At least four of the miners' air packs did not function, so McCloy shared his own rescuer with another miner, and the miners trapped with him shared theirs with the other three men whose own devices did not work: \n\nThe air packs  referred to as \"rescuers\"  are intended to give each miner about an hour's worth of oxygen while they escape or find a pocket of clean air. But at least four of the devices did not function, McCloy said. \"There were not enough rescuers to go around,\" McCloy said. He said he shared his air pack with miner Jerry Groves, and his co-workers did the same with the three other men whose devices were not functioning. Finally, resigned to their fate, the men recited a \"sinner's prayer,\" scrawled farewell notes to their loved ones, and succumbed, some as if drifting off to sleep.\n The miners did not all share their air packs with Randal McCloy because he was a young father in need of help  Randal and some others shared their own rescuers with four other men because there were not enough working packs to go around.

        "justification": "Claim:  E-mail sent from orbit captures Space Shuttle Columbia astronaut Laurel Clark's final words to her family.  \nStatus:  True.\n Examples:  [Collected on the Internet, 2003] \n\n\nLaurel Clark, one of the Shuttle astronauts, was in my cousin Carol's class in high school. Carol's parents were present for the launch and this is an e-mail I received from Carol's mother: I share this beautiful last E mail from our wonderful Laurel Blair Salton Clark in hopes that we may see our earth through her eyes and revel in the peace and beauty she was experiencing.......It is very hard for those of us who knew and loved her to accept what has happened to her and all the remarkable people with her..  Please join me in prayers for Laurel's family and for all the others affected by this terrible tragedy.     Love, Charlsey.....Mom ...or 'whatever  Subject: Hello from 150 NM above the Earrth  Hello from above our magnificent planet Earth. The perspective is truly awe-inspiring. This is a terrific mission and we are very busy doing science round the clock. Just getting a moment to type e-mail is precious so this will be short, and distributed to many who I know and love. I have seen some incredible sights: lightning spreading over the Pacific, the Aurora Australis lighting up the entire visible horizon with the cityglow of Australia below, the crescent moon setting over the limb of the\nEarth, the vast plains of Africa and the dunes on Cape Horn, rivers breaking through tall mountain passes, the scars of humanity, the continuous line of life extending from North America, through Central America and into South America, a crescent moon setting over the limb of our blue planet. Mount Fuji looks like a small bump from up here, but it does stand out as a very distinct landmark.  Magically, the very first day we flew over Lake Michigan and I saw Wind Point (Racine, WI) clearly. Haven't been so lucky since. Every orbit we go over a slightly different part of the Earth. Of course, much of the time I'm working back in Spacehab and don't see any of it. Whenever I do get to look out , it is glorious. Even the stars have a special brightness. I have seen my \"friend\" Orion several times.  Taking photos of the earth is a real challenge, but a steep learning curve. I think I have finally gotten some beautiful shots the last 2 days. Keeping my fingers crossed that they're in sharp focus. My near vision has gotten a little worse up here so you may have seen pics/video of me wearing glasses. I feel blessed to be here representing our country and carrying out the research of scientists around the world. All of the experiments have accomplished most of their goals despite the inevitable hiccups that occur when such a complicated undertaking is undertaken. Some experiments have even done extra science. A few are finished and one is just getting started today. The food is great and I am feeling very comfortable in this new, totally different environment. It still takes a while to eat as gravity doesn't help pull food down your esophagus. It is also a constant challenge to stay adequately hydrated. Since our body fluids are shifted toward our heads our sense of thirst is almost non-existent. Thanks to many of you who have supported me and my adventures throughout the years. This was definitely one to beat all. I hope you could feel the positive energy that I beamed to the whole planet as we glided over our shared planet. Love to all,\nLaurel\n Origins:  Personal   items from deceased love ones that preserve our last contacts with them and connect us with their lives and their final days on Earth  letters, journals, photographs, items of clothing  are usually treasured as special reminders of both the joy and fragility of those lives. Although the media through which we communicate may have changed, the poignancy of a loved one's last words to us has not.  A final message might now consist of a collection of electrons beamed to us from thousands of miles away rather than a letter written with pen and paper, but it is the content of that communication as an expression of a unique and cherished personality that matters most to us, not its form. Space Shuttle Columbia astronaut Laurel Clark of Racine, Wisconsin, left many friends and relatives behind, including a husband and an 8-year-old son, when her life ended in the tragedy of 1 February 2003.  The same technology that transmitted her last direct communication with her family is now being used by millions of people all over the world to share her final words with each other.   There is little doubt that these were Laurel's final words to her family, because they match the description of Laurel's last message given by her brother, Daniel, in an interview with CNN anchor Paula Zahn the day after the Columbia disaster (and the message was circulating before David's description of it was first aired): Laurel Clark interview \n\nIt was an e-mail to all of her family.  It was a very special e-mail for us because it was the last real communication we had directly from her. And she just talked about how thrilled she was to be up there, the view from up there, how great it was seeing different sites, being able to see on her very first day Wind Point in Wisconsin, which is where Racine is, and seeing something familiar there. Also different places around the world.  And then getting into how blessed she felt to be serving her country and getting to do the medical experiments, working with scientists around the world and how thrilling it was. And really helping to share with us a little bit of what she was going through, what it was like to eat in space and how she was acclimating to it, and that she was having fun. And I think it was  it was great to get that at the end.\n Last updated:  25 February 2007\n  \n",

Thank You\n Origins:  Messages like the ones cited above, which provide a privacy warning and purported solution for stopping strangers from viewing one's private Facebook content, seemingly circulate every time that social media site rolls out a new feature.  These messages were spread widely after the introduction of the Facebook Timeline, after the introduction of the Facebook Ticker, and again after the introduction of the Facebook Graph Search.  Each time, the warnings advocated users implement a proffered solution (unclicking \"Comments and  Timeline Likes\" under the \"Subscribed\" box) in order to prevent other friends of your Facebook friends (who may be strangers to you) from seeing your Facebook \"likes\" and \"comments\" activities (and vice-versa).   However, the supposed privacy concerns about Facebook's new Graph Search function expressed in these warnings are inaccurate, as are the instructions for remedying them. Graph Search First off, the Graph Search function merely provides Facebook users with another, easier method for finding information and content posted by other Facebook users.  It makes your Facebook info much easier to find,  but it doesn't change who can see that content; that aspect is still controlled by your own Facebook privacy settings.  Information you've chosen to share only with friends will still be visible only to your friends; information you've made viewable by everyone will remain viewable by everyone: \n\nWho can find your stuff? It all depends on which audience you choose. So if a photo is set to: Only Me = no one else can find it in search\nFriends = friends will see it in their search results\nPublic = anyone who searches for it can find it\n Second, the corrective instructions included in these messages for protecting your Facebook privacy by unchecking \"Comments and Likes\" is old information that was circulated when the Facebook Ticker was introduced back in 2011, and they were wrong even then.   As Sophos noted at that time, the proposed solution was time-consuming and didn't address the real issue of whether other people could see your activity on Facebook: Sophos \n\nThis appears to be the most commonly suggested solution on Facebook, and it's rubbish! It still doesn't stop *your* posts being broadcast. It's an illusion. This option stops you seeing when other people have broadcast a message to a wide audience. It does *not* stop your actions being broadcast by your friends! You have to do this for every single one of your friends. Time consuming *and* it does not solve the problem  it just stops you from seeing it. Please don't spread this advice, as it is confusing people and stopping the real problem from being fixed.\n Following these instructions will simply block your friends' updates from appearing on your timeline (or vice-versa); they won't prevent your updates (or other content) from being findable through Graph Search or visible to other Facebook users. One change that Facebook's Graph App has brought about, as reported at TechCrunch,  is that it's now easier for Facebook users to find photos of you that have been posted and tagged by others, and the visibility of those photos is controlled by the privacy settings of the persons who posted them (rather than by your privacy settings): TechCrunch tagged \n\nIf you recently discovered that people you're not even Facebook friends with have seen some embarrassing photos from your past, then yes, you can probably thank Facebook Graph Search for that. In terms of gaining access to users' photos, Graph Search allows any Facebook user to type in your name, and click the helpfully suggested link \"Photos of\" which appears underneath the search bar. Next thing you know, that Facebook user  possibly a complete stranger to you  can see a bunch of photos of you! And some of those may not be photos you were willing to share. The problem in a nutshell is that Graph Search isn't just about your privacy settings, it's about how respectful your Facebook friends have been of your privacy, too. For example, when vanity Graph Searching myself, I found that a college friend had posted old, slightly embarrassing photos \"publicly,\" tagging me and other friends along the way. Wow, thanks, friend! In the past, this wouldn't have been as big of a deal, because the photo would fall off your Timeline eventually. The photo was still public, but it was less-in-your-face about it, as compared with Graph Search. I could have always seen those photos  they were shared by a Facebook friend of mine with his friends. And I'm his Facebook friend. However, it would have taken a lot more effort to dig them up in the past; Graph Search makes it simple.\n To remedy this situation, TechCrunch advises: \n\nSo what can you do about the photos you didn't know were being shared? For starters, untag yourself in them. That's a quick fix for those that your friends have inappropriately shared. If you want to go the extra mile, report the photo. To do so, in the same place you probably went to remove the tag   the \"Options\" setting underneath the photo  click \"report/remove tag,\" then choose the second option (\"I want this photo removed from Facebook\") and the reason why. That will kick off the process of getting a more permanent takedown.\n\n In October 2013, Facebook did announce the completion of their removal of a privacy setting that allowed members to prevent themselves from appearing in search results: removal \n\nEveryone used to have a setting called \"Who can look up your Timeline by name?,\" which controlled whether you could be found when people typed your name into the Facebook search bar. The setting was created when Facebook was a simple directory of profiles and it was very limited. For example, it didn't prevent people from navigating to your Timeline by clicking your name in a story in News Feed, or from a mutual friend's Timeline. Today, people can also search Facebook using Graph Search (for example, \"People who live in Seattle,\") making it even more important to control the privacy of the things you share rather than how people get to your Timeline. The setting also made Facebook's search feature feel broken at times. For example, people told us that they found it confusing when they tried looking for someone who they knew personally and couldn't find in search results, or when two people were in a Facebook Group and then couldn't find each other through search. The search setting was removed last year for people who weren't using it. For the small percentage of people still using the setting, they will see reminders about it being removed in the coming weeks. Whether you've been using the setting or not, the best way to control what people can find about you on Facebook is to choose who can see the individual things you share.\n Information about controlling who can use Graph Search to find material you have posted to your own Facebook page can be found in Facebook's \"3 Tips About Search Privacy\" and a detailed \"How to Stop People from Snooping on You with Facebook's Graph Search\" article. 3 Tips About Search Privacy How to Stop People from Snooping on You with Facebook's Graph Search  Last updated:  28 September 2015\n ",

The version above (found on Twitter) featured a headline reading \"Chipotle Announced All Stores Will Be Closed by March 2016,\" with lead-in text stating: \"Unfortunate and surprising news from Chipotle Mexican Grill...\" A separate version (from the same source) was titled \"Chipotle to close at the end of 2015,\" with preview text stating: \"According to Chipotle, they will be closing all restraints [sic] as of January 1st, 2016.\" As is often the case with shares of this sort, the surprising \"news\" appeared to gain traction through users who posted the link without clicking through to read the article.

Good proof that humans evolve from marine lives,\" the X caption of Xinhua News Agency's post read. However, the in-question photo did not show the fin of a gray whale, but rather that of a sperm whale. The CCTV post with the image in question read: Xinhua News Agency China Central Television Two sperm whales became stranded near the Yangkou Port in Rudong County, East China's Jiangsu Province on Feb. 14, 2016, and they were later made into specimens in Shanghai and Dalian. Now, one specimen has returned to the port for exhibition. A 2018 research paper with the title \"The myodural bridges' existence in the sperm whale\" referenced the 2016 incident, as the whale was shared by Chinese authorities for the purpose ofscientific research: research paper A 15.1-meter long sperm whale was acquired opportunistically examined in this study from stranding with the permission of Chinese Authorities for Animal Protection. It died naturally in the beache of Nantong (Jiangsu province, China). The cadaver was permitted for scientific research under the approval of the Ethics Committee of Dalian Medical University. Some social media users were surprised that whales' bones had a so humanlike appearance. American Museum of Natural History explained that \"the sperm whale's flippers, or pectoral fins, help the animal maneuver through water.\" explained   (American Museum of Natural History) Moreover, the museum underscored that the sperm whale's bone structure is similar to human bones: They also share bone structure with the human arm and hand.In fact, the bones of cetacean flippers are the same kinds of bones as in the human arm, with an upper arm bone, two forearm bones, and hand, wrist, and finger bones. In whales, fingers are elongated and may have additional bones. The joint between upper arm and forearm is immobile, creating an effective paddle. Whales Online, a magazine published by the Group for Research and Education on Marine Mammals (GREMM), published an articlereferring to the whales' front limbs (emphasis ours): article The front limbs of whales' land-roaming ancestors grew much shorter and transformed into pectoral fins. The bones are no longer articulated and do not allow for any movement. The only point of articulation is the shoulder. These fins serve both as a stabilizer and a rudder. Five digits for toothed whales and right whales, four for rorquals: some are very long, with many more phalanges than in land mammals. The bones of the hand are embedded in a fibrous, rigid and resistant tissue and do not appear at the surface of the skin. And here's what the whale's full skeleton looks like: looks like   (baleinesendirect.org screenshot) Facebook. https://www.facebook.com/cctvcom/posts/sperm-whale-specimen-transported-back-to-porttwo-sperm-whales-became-stranded-ne/10155111753959759/.

One famous instance took place on an episode of Mister Rogers Neighborhood, when Rogers, a white man, dipped his feet in a wading pool alongside Francois Clemmons, a Black man. instance The episode, which aired in May 1969, broke color barriers at a time when Black people were barred from using swimming pools around the United States on account of their race. Civil unrest over segregated pools was also ongoing. That year, the Supreme Court ruled that pool access was a property right that could not be limited by race. broke ruled Decades later, the following meme circulated online:    Clemmons, who played Officer Clemmons on the show, was not a real police officer but an actor. During the episode, Clemmons visits Rogers in his neighborhood on a hot day, and Rogers invites him to dip his feet in a wading pool with him. Rogers also offers to share the same towel. The original clip from 1969 can be seen here at the 1:28 mark:    The meme above shows a photograph from when the scene was recreated by Clemmons and Rogers more than two decades after the original pool scene:   Clemmons reflected on the famous scene in an interview with WBUR's \"Here and Now\": interview I thought [that moment] was kind of light. I was expecting something like maybe calling [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] up or calling the president up or saying, you know, this is amoral and some kind of curse on these people, and he didn't do that at all. He said, 'Come, come sit with me.' And he said, 'You can share my towel.' My God, those were powerful words. It was transformative to sit there with him, thinking to myself, 'Oh, something wonderful is happening here. This is not what it looks like. It's much bigger.' And many people, as I've traveled around the country, share with me what that particular moment meant to them, because he was telling them, 'You cannot be a racist.' And one guy or more than that, but one particularly I'll never forget, said to me, When that program came on, we were actually discussing the fact that black people were inferior. And Mister Rogers cut right through it, he said. And he said essentially that scene ended that argument. Given that the scene took place and broke color barriers during a time when seeing a Black person in a pool with a white person was a civil rights issue, but Clemmons himself was not a real police officer, we rate this claim as Mostly True.

Broadly speaking, the warning appeared in two forms. The most commonly shared was a text post that typically read as follows: *Urgent: Health Bulletin to the Public * *Ministry of healths emergency notification to the public that the Coronavirus outbreak this time is very very serious & fatal. There's no cure once you are infected.*\n*Its spreading from China to various countries* *Prevention method is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold your thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within 10 mins.*\n*Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age.* *Everytime u feel your throat is dry, do not wait, keep water in hand.* *Do not drink plenty at one time as it doesnt help, instead continue to keep throat moist.*\n*Till end of March 2020, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train or public transportation* *Avoid fried or spicy food and load up vitamin C.*\n*The symptoms/ description are*\n*1.repeated high fever*\n*2.prolonged coughing after fever*\n*3.Children are prone*\n*4.Adults usually feel uneasy,*headache and mainly respiratory related*\n*5: highly contagious*   The message was typically followed up with an exhortation to share its warnings, such as, \"Please forward to help others.\" One version of the viral alert even concluded by pleading with readers, \"Please share if you care for human life.\"  warnings version The second principal form in which the message appeared was as a photograph of a printed email, dated Jan. 28, 2020, and purporting to have been sent by \"NWLLAB.\" It contained many of the same key components  it purported to come from an unspecified \"MOH\" (Ministry of Health), and its main recommendation to the public was again to \"keep your throat moist\" by drinking water. It read as follows: appeared photograph Pls tell ur families, relatives and friends MOH Health Bulletin to the Public: The Upper Respiratory Infection affecting China at present is quite serious. The virus causing it is very potent and is resistant to existing antibiotics.  (virus is not bacterial infection hence cannot be treated by antibiotics). The prevention method now is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold your thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within 10 mins. Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age. Everytime [sic] you feel your throat is dry, do not wait, keep water in hand. Do not drink plenty at one time as it does not help; instead, continue to keep throat moist. Till end of March, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train or public transportation.  Avoid fried or spicy food and load up vitamin C.  The symptoms/description are: 1. Repeated high fever.\n2. Prolonged coughing after fever. \n3. Children are more prone. \n4. Adults usually feel uneasy, headache and mainly respiratory related illness.  This illness is highly contagious. Let's continue to pray and wait for further notice about the infection.  Please share.    Neither the printed email nor the viral Facebook message were official statements produced by any public health authority. The alert was apt to spread widely online precisely because it did not include any details about its supposed source, aside from mentioning a \"Ministry of Health\" in an unspecified country or region.  The message also contained erroneous advice, claiming that readers could avoid contracting the virus by \"keeping your throat moist,\" avoiding fried or spicy food, and taking vitamin-C supplements. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the so-called \"novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\" outbreak is thought to have first been transmitted from animals to humans in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in China. Since then, it has spread from person to person. Previous coronaviruses like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been transmitted between humans primarily through \"respiratory droplets\"  that is, coughs and sneezes.  outbreak The CDC's general respiratory infection prevention advice applies to the 2019-nCoV outbreak, as follows: as follows No evidence exists to indicate that any public health authority is officially advising the public that a dry throat makes individuals more vulnerable to contracting the virus, and that therefore drinking water is an effective prevention method, nor that vitamin C deficiency contributes to one's vulnerability to contracting the illness, nor that fried and spicy food are a medium for transmission of 2019-nCoV.

O'Connell posted a photograph of his son with the helmet and explained that he had worn it throughout his FDNY career, including during 9/11 and its aftermath: Facebook   This was my FDNY helmet I wore my entire career including 9/11/01. It was stolen from my home a while back. I know it's a long shot but if enough people share maybe it turns up or is sent back so I can keep it in my family! Thanks! The NYC Wire Fire Facebook page helped spread O'Connell's message by resharing his post with the caption, \"In case anyone comes across this ... maybe the thief is stupid enough to try to sell on eBay.\" Within a week, the message reportedly reached more than 8 million people and had been reshared hundreds of thousands of times. Unfortunately, despite the wide dissemination of this Facebook post, it did not result in the return of O'Connell's FDNY helmet. Facebook reportedly AM New York reported on 24 June 2015, a few weeks after the Facebook post went viral, that while O'Connell had not been reunited with his helmet, he did receive an outpouring of support from the community and two replica helmets from \"good Samaritans hoping to sooth the sting\" of his loss: reported Retired firefighter Michael O'Connell's social media campaign to retrieve his stolen FDNY helmet has gotten him the next best thing -- two replicas thanks to some good Samaritans. \"There are still amazing people in this world!,\" O'Connell said. O'Connell, 39, recently turned to Facebook to track down the significant memento that he wore at Ground Zero following 9/11 and hoped to leave to his three children. What came back instead were two painstakingly created replica helmets from good Samaritans hoping to soothe the sting of his loss and an avalanche of human kindness and compassion. \"I'm taking the good out of this story, not the bad,\" said O'Connell, who was forced to retire from the FDNY after being diagnosed with sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease that attacks the lungs and lymphatic system, in 2007. \"We live in an amazing world. So many people are willing to help. I hope people recognize this more than all the hate out there,\" he said. Although this FDNY firefighter's message was originally posted in June 2015, social media users have continued to share his plea on Facebook over the ensuing years. In April 2019, for example, a screenshot of O'Connell's message that was posted by the \"Ramsey, New Jersey Volunteer Fire Department\" racked up more than 600,000 shares. Ramsey, New Jersey Volunteer Fire Department When viewers learned that this message was nearly four years old by the time they encountered it in April 2019, they were left wondering if O'Connell had ever been reunited with his firefighter helmet. Unfortunately, that's not the case. O'Connell told us in April 2019: \"I appreciate everyones support in this matter. Unfortunately, my helmet was never returned! Hoping that it will make its way back home one day as I am a retired FF who has fallen sick to my work on September 11th and this was the helmet that I wore that day and throughout my career!\" Stepansky, Joseph.  \"FDNY Firefighter's Helmet Worn During 9/11 Stolen from Long Island Home.\"\r\n  New York Daily Post.  3 June 2015.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. \n fighting Find out Read Submit Become a Founding Member CDC WHO In early 2020, a number of smartphone applications (apps) were tested and launched across North America to help regions identify which users have been infected with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, who they came into contact with, and transmission zones.  These apps are attempting to help make contact tracing easier, a form of disease control that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) calls a key strategy for preventing further spread of the disease. The process involves public health staff who work with COVID-19 patients to help them recall everyone they came into contact with during the time they may have been infectious. Staff then warn exposed individuals in a rapid and sensitive manner (while protecting the identity of the patient) and provide support and information on how to mitigate the spread.  calls In May 2020, a number of Facebook posts claimed that mobile apps that are using contact tracing to research COVID-19 transmission patterns are also taking information from the user's device to \"identify, track or locate\" various contacts on their phones or their Facebook friends lists. Most posts refer to one of two such apps: Healthy Together or ABTraceTogether. The posts say:     These posts greatly exaggerate the extent to which apps have access to contact lists and particularly to Facebook accounts.  Healthy Together, built by Twenty Holdings, Inc., was rolled out by the state of Utah in April and May 2020, as part of an effort to help public health officials trace contacts of those infected with the disease, and to allow Utahns to track their symptoms and find the nearest testing center. The app uses GPS, location data, and Bluetooth technology to identify potential contacts. rolled out Bluetooth technology allows health officials to gather data by connecting devices to each other, while GPS data allows them to track a person's movements and their location to within 5 to 10 feet. Thus, Bluetooth determines potential person-to-person transmission of the disease while GPS tracking figures out potential transmission zones and how contagious diseases can move through populations and regions.  allows The Utah government is encouraging more people to download this application. As of May 13, more than 45,000 people had done so, at least 2% of the states population, according to CNBC. CNBC The app is opt-in and voluntary and allows users to control what data they release. They own their personal data and can delete it at any time. Location data is automatically deleted after 30 days, symptom data becomes anonymous after 30 days, and users can identify what data they would like to share, which includes Bluetooth data, location data, or contact lists. The app The FAQ on the Utah governments coronavirus resources website suggest that officials are taking precautions around user privacy as well: FAQ Will anyone have access to personally identifiable information?\nPublic health officials and a limited number of development employees with Twenty Holdings, Inc. will have access to your name, phone number, and location data for COVID-19 tracing purposes only. What collective data would the Utah government like to share publicly in the weeks following the launch?\nThe State of Utah values the role of limited government and recognizes that asking you to provide personal information may be uncomfortable and concerning to some. However, you can be assured that your personal data will be used only for the purpose of fighting COVID-19. Utah will investigate GPS and location data to help understand transmission zones, with the goal of informing policy makers so they can make swift and smart decisions in the coming weeks or months. Healthy Together's privacy policy also states users may provide the following, among other details:  privacy policy We may receive: Registration and Profile Information. We may receive information from you when you register to use Healthy Together. That information may include, among other things, your full name, phone numbers, and device identifiers.\nContact List. If you choose to share your mobile device contacts or address book with Healthy Together, we will store your contacts or address book information, including the phone numbers and names of your contacts, to enable you to invite your contacts to Healthy Together and help facilitate your user experience. Healthy Together responded to Snopes' questions about these rumors: Only if a user opts-in to share their phones contact list, can they then invite friends on their contact list to use the app. Sending this invitation will prompt their contact to join Healthy Together, but this invitation to join the app is also opt-in. Sending an invitation to a friend does not mean Healthy Together will track or automatically collect data. If someone chooses to download the app by accepting their friends invitation, they too have to opt-in to share any data permissions. The app is not connected to Facebook and Healthy Together users cannot invite their Facebook friends to use the app. Healthy Together is not tracing anyone who is not a user of the app, and is not tracing anyone who does not opt in to the Bluetooth or location data permissions. Healthy Together is completely opt-in, users own their data, and can delete it at any time. Thus the app's ability to access your contact list is in the user's control and is available only to invite friends to download the app. The app does not appear to have the ability to access your Facebook friends list. Furthermore, the app can only track and identify people who have downloaded it, so those people without the app cannot be tracked.  The app ABTraceTogether requires even less information from the user. The other app at the center of the Facebook/phone contacts rumor mill has been downloaded in the Canadian province of Alberta 100,000 times as of May 5. This voluntary app also does not connect to your phone contact list or Facebook friends list but collects only the following information: 100,000 following information During the app set up, the only personal data we collect is your mobile number, so Alberta Health Services can contact you quickly if you were in close proximity to a COVID-19 case. With your consent, the ABTraceTogether app exchanges Bluetooth proximity data with nearby phones running the same app. This data is anonymized and encrypted, and does not reveal your identity or the other persons identity. In order to measure distance, information about your phone model and the signal strength recorded is also shared, since different phone models transmit at a different power. This data is stored only on your phone, and is not shared with Alberta Health Services. Should Alberta Health Services need the data for contact tracing, they will ask you directly to share it with them and enable an upload of your contact tracing logs. Contact tracers, health officials who are trying to track down people exposed to the virus, may ask users about their locations in verbal interviews. The app's privacy policy states: Contact tracers privacy policy The information you provide will be collected by Alberta Health and Alberta Health Services for the purpose of conducting contact-tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic response to manage the public health emergency under the Public Health Act. [...] ABTraceTogether enables you to exchange non-identifying information with other users via Bluetooth; other users will not have access to any of your individually identifying information. If you receive a positive diagnosis for COVID-19, Alberta Health or Alberta Health Services will send you a code to enter into the Application. Your information will then be accessed and potentially disclosed by Alberta Health and Alberta Health Services to one another, for the purpose of facilitating contact-tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The privacy policy further points out that because tracers rely only on Bluetooth technology and not GPS, they do not collect data about users' locations; they only communicate with nearby phones through Bluetooth for a limited period.  Privacy advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) are critical of apps that ask for names and phone numbers of users, arguing that will erode trust and discourage people from signing on. They argue that developers need to be as transparent as possible to ensure their app is effective. Bennett Cyphers, a Staff Technologist with EFF spoke to Snopes, arguing that ultimately these apps should only get what is absolutely necessary from the user, with \"as little private information [and] strict data minimization,\" something they don't agree apps like Healthy Together and ABTraceTogether are doing:  critical [The government] doesnt need [this information], they want it ... Apples and Googles proposals [have] ways to do it where the user's phone is able to give push notifications to the user through anonymized data. There are ways to do contact tracing that is privacy preserving, and that the government doesn't get data at all. The only difference between [the] decentralized contact tracing approach (which Apple and Google are proposing) and the centralized approach is that in the first model [when] someone who you've contacted is sick, [you will be notified] on your phone and it will tell you what to do and which public health officials to get in touch with. The other scenario is the government calls you themselves. The government prefers the latter because it gives them more control. We don't think there is a significant difference in the outcome [pertaining to health access] for users. ...All these apps are opting to share a record of who the people interacted with. That can reveal a lot about what you do, whether you engage in political activism, criminal activity, all kinds of things not related to COVID, and the government will have access [to it] ... We wouldn't be able to tell you what the government will do [with this] but what they could do ... [and] that's the problem. Jeff Jenkins, associate professor of Information Systems at the Brigham Young University, Marriott School of Business, said this about Healthy Together in a published news interview: \"Jenkins said he feels like the app gives users a reasonable amount of control over their data, even if its not totally clear how the data will be used. 'With any app, there is a tradeoff between the intended benefit  in this case, combating COVID-19  and privacy.'\" interview A range of contact-tracing apps were being tested and implemented in the spring of 2020. In May, Apple and Google released their own smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they have been exposed to someone with the virus. Unlike Healthy Together, their tech relies solely on Bluetooth technology to monitor person-to-person contact. Many of these apps are achieving mixed results, and the full implications of their impact on data privacy are being closely followed by groups like EFF and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  released In sum, little evidence exists to indicate that apps like Healthy Together and ABTraceTogether are collecting others' information from users' phone or Facebook contacts, especially without consent. As their privacy policies outline, the information they gather is for specific health-related purposes, and all the information given is with the user's consent. Healthy Together can receive your contact list if you agree to it, while ABTraceTogether only asks for your phone number. Furthermore, users have to actually install the app for their interactions to be monitored, or their location to be tracked. Individuals without the app will not be tracked this way. As such, we rate this claim a \"Mixture.\"  Update, Dec. 2, 2020: In July 2020, Utah's state epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn announced that Healthy Together's major feature of using GPS and Bluetooth location tracking would be turned off, \"Weve learned over the course of the last three months that location tracking isnt popular and as a result, it hasnt really been helpful to our contact tracing efforts.\" In November, the state's health leaders announced their intention to explore using Google and Apple technology to notify users if they had been exposed to the coronavirus. Healthy Together now serves as a symptom checker and a resource for people in the event that they get COVID-19. announced November ABTraceTogether has also face issues with its effectiveness. In November, the Alberta government revealed that its app had been used to trace only 20 cases over six months. The province also said that issues with the app could persist on devices made by Apple and the app needs further testing. Apple and Google's contact tracing software forms the backbone of the federal Canadian government's COVID Alert app, and is being used in all provinces except Alberta and British Columbia.

However, two Great White Sharks have managed to survive the trip and make their way up the Mississippi River and in to the Illinois River somehow. Believed to have started as a mating couple, the two are assumed to have swam the 1250 mile journey to the Chicago suburb River from the mouth of the Mississippi River that is also connected to the Gulf Of Mexico perhaps ending up at their current location as a recent influx of Asian Carp would be a great feeding ground for the apex predators. Officials in Morris have contacted the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and will likely have a team in the river soon to capture the two lost sharks.\n But this photograph does not show two great white sharks, nor was it taken in the Mississippi River (much less near St. Louis) or the Illinois River. This photograph has been circulating since at least 2008, when it was posted to Flickr along with the caption \"Bull Shark  Rio Sirena River Mouth.\" A bull shark would indeed be more likely spotted in the Sirena River (which is located in Corcovado National Park in Costa Rica) than a great white shark would be in the Mississippi River near St. Louis.

In 2013, RFKDNews used the same image alongside a report that six people in Illinois jad been eaten by \"river sharks\" after their hot air balloon popped. (They weren't.) image The National Oceanic and Atmospheric administration provides a guide to identifying sharks based on their dorsal fins. White sharks, also called great whites, have dorsal fins with a more ragged edge and are darker in color than bull sharks: guide White shark\n  Bull shark\n  Great whites rarely attack from the surface, preferring instead to grab their prey from underneath.

U.S. President Joe Biden held a number of bilateral meetings and news conferences during the event, and although a number of world leaders made remarks praising the American president  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Biden was \"a big breath of fresh air,\" and French President Emmanuel Macron said it was \"great to have a U.S. president whos part of the club\"  some Biden critics focused on a single image from the multi-day trip that they claimed showed Macron \"scolding\" the U.S. president: Joe Biden   This is a genuine image of Biden and Macron. However, the claim that Macron was \"scolding\" Biden is based purely on speculation. A single photograph is rarely enough to tell the entire story of an interaction. In fact, we've covered multiple instances in which single photographs were misrepresented and shared with misleading or fabricated context. In May 2017, for example, an image of Pope Francis \"frowning\" with former President Donald Trump was shared alongside an image of the pope \"smiling\" with former President Barack Obama. These photographs were both real, but they only showed a single moment from each president's meeting with the pope and did not accurately depict his mood during these meetings. We found other images that showed the pope smiling with Trump and frowning with Obama. image This tactic of cherry-picking a single image to create a misleading narrative was also at play when users shared the image that supposedly showed Macron \"scolding\" Biden. Although one could share this \"scolding\" image along with claims that Biden was \"bullied\" by European leaders, one could share other photographs (such as the one at the top of this page) to claim that Biden was best buds with Macron.  This image of Macron \"scolding\" Biden is available via Getty Images. The caption states that the two leaders were having a discussion before the start of the NATO summit: Getty Images \"US President Joe Biden (R) and French President Emmanuel Macron (L) have a conversation ahead of the NATO summit at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) headquarters in Brussels, on June 14, 2021.\"  We did not find video showing the specific moment captured in this photograph, but we did find some footage of Biden and Macron talking before the start of the NATO summit. You can catch a glimpse of Biden and Macron speaking at the 3:08-minute mark of the following video.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFfJkWTAu-E\n\nYou can't hear what they are saying to one another, but it doesn't appear that this is a heated conversation. Reporting from the NATO summit also made no mention of unusual tensions between the two world leaders. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Reuters reported: reported The United States is back as a cooperative leader of the free world under President Joe Biden, Frances Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday, illustrating the relief felt by many key U.S. allies that the tumult of Donald Trumps presidency is over. Macrons remark echoes that of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who hailed Biden on Thursday as a big breath of fresh air. Neither Macron nor Johnson drew an explicit parallel between Biden and Trump, though both praised Bidens distinctly cooperative tone and officials said there was relief after Trump at times shocked and bewildered many European allies. Biden, asked by a reporter if America was back, turned to Macron and gestured with his sunglasses towards the French president that he should answer that question. Yes definitely, Macron said. Its great to have a U.S. president whos part of the club and very willing to cooperate. What you demonstrate is that leadership is partnership, Macron told Biden as they sat on an outdoor terrace with a sweeping view of the turquoise sea behind them. Biden and Macron shared several moments together in June 2021. We found several images of them laughing together and even walking arm in arm. Reporting from the event also indicated that Macron's attitude toward the new U.S. president was generally positive. Here's a video of Biden and Macron during a meeting a few days before the NATO summit: laughing together walking arm in arm ",

At first, many thought it was a Pacific Sleeper Shark. The issue with that theory is the Pacific Sleeper Shark grow only to 20 feet, the shark featured is 50+ feet long. That measurement is estimated using the length of the cage, which is 10 feet across. Could this be the last remaining Megalodon? Watch and share! Buzz Channel's post was rife with misinformation. This video wasn't \"breaking,\" it didn't show a 50-foot shark, it wasn't filmed in the Mariana Trench, and it absolutely didn't capture an extinct megalodon. The earliest version of this video we could uncover was posted to YouTube in 2008: YouTube  That version of the video stated that the footage captured a 7-meter (22-foot) Pacific sleeper shark off the coast of Japan in the Suruga Bay. While certain details of the video are still unclear (such as the date it was made), the clip's description matches that of a shark filmed off the coast of Japan in 1989: matches In September 1989, a large female Pacific Sleeper  estimated to be 23 feet (7 metres) long  was filmed from the viewing ports of a submersible at a depth of 4,000 feet (1,220 metres) off Saruga Bay, Japan. Here's a comparison of the shark in the video and another sleeper shark:  While the shark in the video is indeed large, it would be considered rather small if it were actually a megalodon. Fossil records of that extinct shark species suggest that it reached a size of nearly 60 feet in length.",

        ],
        "justification": "  Claim:  Facebook has \"deleted all privacy settings\" and is \"getting rid of its privacy policy.\" FALSE Examples:  [Collected via Facebook, October 2013] \nOK FOLKS HERE WE GO AGAIN, AS OF MONDAY OCT 14, 2013 ACCORDING TO THE NEWS, IT WILL NOW BE HARDER THAN EVER TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GETTING ANY INFO ON YOU CAUSE FACEBOOK AND OBAMA CROOKED ASS SO CALLED GOVERNMENT HAVE TEAMED UP TO DELETE ALL PRIVACY SETTINGS ON FACEBOOK. MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE YR PRIVATE INFO, PLEASE SHARE AND DELETE YR MOBILE NUMBERS, EMAILL ADDRESSES ETC BEFORE YOU CANNOT. THIS IS ON FOX, ABC, CBS, AND ALL RADIO STATIONS !!!!!!!!\n \n I heard that Facebook is getting rid of its privacy policy?  If so, what about the safety of the children who are on Facebook?\n Origins:  Back in December 2012 Facebook announced it would be retiring an option that allowed users to control whether they show up when others type their names into the Facebook search bar.  The social network began eliminating that option (which shows up in privacy settings as \"Who can look up your timeline by name?\") from the accounts of people who weren't using it, and in October 2013 Facebook announced it would be completing the removal of that setting for the \"small percentage of people still using it\": removal \n\nEveryone used to have a setting called \"Who can look up your Timeline by name?,\" which controlled whether you could be found when people typed your name into the Facebook search bar. The setting was created when Facebook was a simple directory of profiles and it was very limited. For example, it didn't prevent people from navigating to your Timeline by clicking your name in a story in News Feed, or from a mutual friend's Timeline. Today, people can also search Facebook using Graph Search (for example, \"People who live in\nSeattle,\") making it even more important to control the privacy of the things you share rather than how people get to your Timeline. The setting also made Facebook's search feature feel broken at times. For example, people told us that they found it confusing when they tried looking for someone who they knew personally and couldn't find in search results, or when two people were in a Facebook Group and then couldn't find each other through search. The search setting was removed last year for people who weren't using it. For the small percentage of people still using the setting, they will see reminders about it being removed in the coming weeks. Whether you've been using the setting or not, the best way to control what people can find about you on Facebook is to choose who can see the individual things you share.\n This development did not, as claimed in some alarmist messages spread on the Internet, \"delete all privacy settings on Facebook,\" nor did Facebook \"get rid of its privacy policy\" (and the change certainly had nothing to do with the Obama administration or the U.S. government).  All of Facebook's other privacy controls and policies remain in place, and while the \"Who can look up your Timeline by name?\" setting had some utility for helping Facebook users be less visible to those who might be searching for them, it didn't absolutely prevent others from finding them: \n\n[The setting] wasn't perfect. It would not have stopped, for example, Facebook users from being able to access profiles if those users had been tagged in a public post or picture. Still, it did help those users to keep a lower profile on the social network, such as those trying to hide their profiles from abusive ex-partners or harassment.\n\n There is no equivalent function for preventing other people from finding a Facebook user by name in the search bar, as Facebook has been moving towards prompting users to maintain privacy on an item-by-item basis rather than by entirely hiding their profiles and activity from others.  However, as noted in a Washington Post Technology\narticle, using a variety of privacy settings and precautions can help prevent the revealing of your personal information to those whom you might not wish to see it: article \n\n[W]henever and however you post, you should be checking to see if what you're putting up is for public view or just for friends or specific lists of friends. Also, consider turning on Timeline approval, which shows you what your friends may be posting about your location or whom you're with. You can ask them to remove your name from those posts. Facebook has settings that let you review posts and photo tags before they're posted to your Timeline. If privacy is a major concern, use these tools and don't hesitate to ask other users to remove posts about you that make you uncomfortable. Another key option in the privacy settings menu is one that lets users disable search engines from linking to their timelines. That will at least cut down on the chance that someone looking for you outside the social network will be able to find your profile. If your whereabouts or similar information are sensitive, particularly if it's a safety issue, you should be very aware of locations on your posts  no check-ins  and be careful about writing posts that give clues about where you are. Users should also remember that they can also always block specific users from seeing their Facebook page or from contacting them, but this is more of a reactive step than a proactive one. Plus, just as you could alter your name (yes, in violation of Facebook's guidelines) to hide your identity, so could anyone who is looking for you. If you're concerned about past posts, Facebook has a setting that lets you limit the audience for posts and information that are already on your profile. You can also go to the \"Activity Log\" on your timeline to get an action-by-action view of how your activity shows up on the site. And finally, as Facebook itself makes clear, remember that \"things you hide from your timeline still appear in news feed, search and other places on Facebook.\" There include some things you just can't hide, namely profile pictures and cover photos, but also some news feed activity.\n In October 2013, Facebook also loosened restrictions on the extent to which teenager users could share their Facebook activity with others: restrictions \n\nFacebook Inc removed a restriction for users under 18 that previously limited who could see their online postings. Facebook said that teenagers would now be able to manually alter the setting and share information with the public. Until now, a teenager's postings on Facebook were only viewable to their friends, and to the friends of their friends.\n In September 2015, this old bit of misinformation was linked to a hoax holding that Facebook would be implementing a monthly charge to keep user profiles private. hoax \n\n\n\n   Last updated:  28 September 2015\n    Ngak, Chenda.  \"Viral \"Facebook Privacy Notice\" Is a Hoax.\"    Stern, Joanna.  \"Ignore the 'Copyright' Facebook Post.\"    Sydiongco, David.  \"Don't Bother Posting the 'Facebook Privacy Notice' That's Spreading Around.\"",

        "justification": "Claim:  E-mailed invitations from friends to join the Tagged.com web site are a form of scam or virus. MIXTURE Examples:  [Collected via e-mail, June 2008] \nI understand tagged.com is a virus ridden site and produces a virus that invades through the users address book..any truth to this?\n \n I have, in the past two days. received several email messages  often from the same person  saying \"___ has sent you a message from Tagged or photos from Tagged. When i called the supposed sender to ask about it, they said they did not send them & had received the same messages. We deleted them all but have been getting more of the same messages from other friends. Is this a new virus? Where & how did it start?\n \n This is fyi - I just received an email supposedly from a friend in Atlanta saying she wanted to share her pictures with me and I had to sign up to be her friend on a social networking sight named \"Tagged.\" She is not a photographer, and not the kind to share pics over the internet, but is a friend, and I didn't want to offend her, so I began the process. I didn't like info they were asking for (phone no, cell phone #, password, etc.) so I cancelled out of it and replied to the email, telling her I was her friend but wouldn't join the site. That email went to her - it was her legitimate address - but she emailed me back saying she had NOT tried to share any pics with me. Shortly after I got another email from her saying she had just received one from a friend who, when contacted, also had NOT sent it or tried to share pics with her. She ran a virus scan quickly and no virus was attached, so it is evidently some SCAM going around. My thought is that it is from someone trying to sign you up for phone rings, games, etc. I noticed about halfway through the sign-up process that the address in the line changed from the original one. So be warned - if you receive anything from anyone asking you to join TAGGED and see their pictures, DO NOT JOIN - do not respond in any way to it. It is phony as a $3 bill.\n Origins:  Millions of Internet users have received messages like the ones referenced above, e-mails with subject lines indicating that some acquaintance has sent them photos or a private message on \"Tagged\" and urging them to visit and join the site to view the material lest the sender \"think you said no :(\":  Many recipients, upon learning that these mysterious messages were not actually sent by the persons named, have believed them to be a form of virus or scam. While these messages may not technically fall completely within either the \"virus\" or \"scam\" classifications (because they don't furtively install malicious software on PCs, nor is there an intent to disable computers or obtain money through fraud behind them),  the method by which they're spread and their deceptiveness include elements of both those classes. Tagged.com is a social networking site which has been in existence since 2004.  Its current registration process asks applicants to supply an e-mail address and a password for accessing the corresponding e-mail account so Tagged can \"match you up with your friends,\" information which the company apparently uses to traverse address books (or other e-mail contacts) and send e-mailed invitations to the addresses found there  invitations like the ones noted above, which deceptively appear to have been sent by the Tagged members themselves and claim that the recipients have been \"added as a friend,\" \"sent photos\" or \"sent a private message\" on Tagged (even though no deliberate \"adding\" has taken place, nor have any photos or private messages for the recipients been posted for viewing). An April 2007 eWeek article describes and verifies Tagged's disingenuous e-mail generation process, and McAfee SiteAdvisor entry for Tagged.com has logged numerous complaints about the practice.   article entry Tagged.com's current terms of service (TOS) now include the following disclaimer acknowledging that its members' personal information may be used for the purpose of \"initiating commercial e-mail messages\" (i.e. sending spam): TOS \n\nE) Notice Regarding Commercial Email MEMBERS CONSENT TO RECEIVE COMMERCIAL E-MAIL MESSAGES FROM TAGGED, AND ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THEIR EMAIL ADDRESSES AND OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE USED BY TAGGED FOR THE PURPOSE OF INITIATING COMMERCIAL E-MAIL MESSAGES.\n In November 2009, tagged.com was ordered to pay $500,000 in penalties and costs to the state of New York and $250,000 in penalties and costs to Texas.  Tagged CEO Greg Tseng said the 5-year-old company had voluntarily proposed reforms and overhauled its registration process. It also planned to add more privacy features. However, the company has failed to admit any wrongdoing. Last updated:  14 November 2009\n    Associated Press.  \"Tagged.com Settles With NY, Texas in Invite Fight.\"",

MIXTURE: WHAT'S TRUE:   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed the social network is adding a function resembling that of the long-requested \"Dislike\" button.     WHAT'S FALSE:  The feature in question is specifically a \"Dislike\" button. Example:    [Collected via Twitter, September 2015] After years of demand, Facebook finally announce a dislike button.

As Facebook continued its domination of social media, CEO Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly discussed the \"Dislike\" button concept during interviews and Facebook Q&As. In July 2010, Zuckerberg told ABC's Diane Sawyer [video] he would \"definitely think about\" adding the oft-requested function, but on 2 April 2013 Facebook product engineer Bob Baldwin cast doubt on the feature's future in a popular Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) session: video Reddit AMA Actions on Facebook tend to focus on positive social interactions. Like is the lightest-weight way to express positive sentiment. I don't think adding a light-weight way to express negative sentiment would be that valuable. I know there are times when it'd make sense, like when a friend is having a rough day, or got into a car accident like my sister yesterday (she's okay!). For these times, a nice comment from a friend goes a long way. In December 2014, the \"Dislike\" button was addressed again in a Facebook Q&A with Zuckerberg. In response to a question about whether the social network ever planned to introduce one, he offered a detailed explanation as to why Facebook users ought not to expect the feature any time soon: Facebook Q&A You know were thinking about it, on the Dislike button. Its an interesting question, right, because there are two things that it can mean. And were considering and talking about doing one and not the other. So the one that we dont want to do: The Like button is really valuable because its a way for you to very quickly express a positive emotion or sentiment when someone puts themselves out there and shares something. And, you know, some people have asked for a Dislike button because they want to be able to say 'That thing isnt good'. And that's not something that we think is good for the world. So were not going to build that. I dont think there needs to be a voting mechanism about whether posts are good or bad. I dont think thats socially very valuable or good for the community to help people share the important moments in their lives. But the thing that I think is very valuable is there are more sentiments that people want to express than positivity or that they Like something. You know a lot of times people share things on Facebook that are sad moments in their lives, or are tough cultural or social things and often people tell us that they dont feel comfortable press Like because Like isnt the appropriate sentiment when someone lost a loved one or is talking about a very difficult issue ... everyone feels like they can just press the Like button and thats an important way to sympathize or empathize with someone in an important moment that put themselves out there to share. And giving people the power to do that in more ways with more emotions would be powerful, but we need to figure out the right way to do it so it ends up being a force for good, not a force for bad and demeaning the posts that people are putting out there. So thats an important thing. We dont have anything thats coming out soon but its an important area of discussion. Over the years, Zuckerberg's reiteration of the site's position on a \"Dislike\" button hasn't staunched the flow of news articles and blog posts heralding the imminent arrival of the feature. On 15 September 2015, news media announced anew that the \"Dislike\" button was coming to Facebook. However, Zuckerberg once again hadn't said precisely that: said You know, I think people have asked about the Dislike button for many years and probably hundreds of people have asked about this. Today is a special day because today is the day where I actually get to say that were working on it, and are very close to shipping a test of it. You know, it took us awhile to get here. Because you know, we didnt want to just build a Dislike button because we dont want to turn Facebook into a forum where people are voting up or down on peoples posts. That doesnt seem like the kind of community we want to create. You dont want to go through the process of sharing some moment thats important to you in your day and then have someone down vote it. That isnt what were here to build in the world. But over the years of people asking for this, what weve kind of come to understand is that people arent looking an ability to downvote other peoples posts. What they really want is to be able to express empathy. Although Zuckerberg's complete answer was slightly longer, he disclosed no additional details about the feature in development that he (it seems) erroneously described as a \"Dislike\" button. Facebook's CEO has long maintained that any such future project is likely to focus on expressions of empathy, not distaste.

        "justification": " Claim:  Lottery winners are sharing their fortunes with social media users. FALSE Examples:  [Collected via e-mail, November 2012] \na male named Nolan Daniels from Florida Ridge Fl is posting he will give a million dollars to the millionth person who shares his picture on Facebook... is this true?\n \n This guy on Facebook says he won Powerball and if you share his photo, he will give 1 million to a random individual. The picture features the user in question holding the \"winning\" Powerball ticket. \n Origins:  At the close of November 2012, the record Powerball jackpot was hit to the tune of $587.5 million. One of the winning tickets was sold in Missouri, and the other in Arizona. After the drawing, a couple in Missouri bearing the surname of Hill was identified as the holders of one of two winning tickets, and nearly  two weeks later Phoenix, Arizona, resident Matthew Good was identified as the other. Nolan Daniels looks nothing like either of those winners. While the numbers displayed in the photo that he'd like others to post to their Facebook walls in hopes of being the lucky millionth poster do match the winning numbers drawn for the $587.5 million jackpot, they're not in numerical order, which proves the photo is a fake. As stated in the Powerball FAQ: \"The tickets print the white ball numbers (the first five numbers) in numerical order.\" Powerball FAQ A handful of days later, a Facebook post authored by \"Sokhavy Hilton\" appeared. He announced: \nYes, I am one of the winner of 580$ Million PowerBall :) I will pick 10 random people to get 1 Million $ each if you share this! I care for others too! :) \n The chunk of cheese being used to lure the easily gulled had grown: while \"Nolan Daniels\" promised to bestow one winner with $1 million, \"Sokhavy Hilton\" promised 10 winners $1 million apiece.   In November 2014 a similar claim emerged, this one initially posted on Instagram before it crossed over to e-mail and other social media sites: \nMy wife just reposted an image from Rick Knudsen on Instagram saying that he'd send $1000 to anybody who follows and reposts. Sounds a bit like the Bill Gates email chain back in the early 2000's. Anyways, it seems super sketchy to me but couldn't find definitive proof on if it was legitimate or completely fake. Thanks @oprah & @tylerperry. Such a blessing for us to win this amount of money and now I'm giving back to those in need. My name is Rick Knudsen I won the California lottery of $180 Million. I am a father of five and very blessed. First 50k followers will receive a $1000 from me. ONLY WAY TO GET $1000 YOU MUST 1.) FOLLOW ME REPOST THIS VIDEO AND TAG YOUR FRIENDS 2.) SHOUT ME OUT 3.) COMMENT  \n While a man named Rick Knudsen did win a $180 million Powerball jackpot in California in September 2014, the Instagram account was a phony; mentions of Oprah and Tyler Perry were included to lend the hoax legitimacy.  So, once again, there is no free lunch to be had, no free-spirited $1 million giveaway from some hithertofore unheard of overjoyed Powerball winner. Instead, it's all just a hoax intended to lure the gullible into chasing a non-existent rainbow and in the process bestowing upon its perpetrator some cheap Internet fame.

His parents can't afford surgery so facebook and CNN are paying half of the expenses\n1 Like - $1\n1 Comment - 10$\n1 Share - 20$\n Origins:  In August 2015, the above-displayed image urging viewers to share a photograph of a boy with a massive tumor in order raise funds for his medical care was circulated widely via Facebook. But neither the image nor its claim was new; the tandem was simply a reiteration of a hoax that had circulated more than a year earlier involving the same photograph and plea. This \"raise money for a child's medical care by sharing this photo on Facebook\" format of hoax is common: Previous variations include a child purportedly shot  by a family member, a toddler who needed shot a heart transplant, a little girl from Poland in desperate need of money for burn treatment, a girl with a distended abdomen, and a baby born with its heart outside its body. heart transplant burn treatment abdomen heart As is often the case with these popular social media hoaxes, the image used was one of a real child suffering a real medical condition, and that image was deliberately selected with the intent of tugging at the heartstrings of Facebook users for purposes unconnected to the depicted child's recovery or well-being. The photograph used in this case is one that was widely reproduced in conjunction with 2012 news coverage about the case of a 9-year-old boy with a massive tumor who was brought to the U.S. from Ciudad Juarez in Mexico for medical treatment: news coverage \n\nA 9-year-old boy with a massive tumor was whisked from a dangerous neighborhood in Mexico in an armored vehicle by U.S. agents and taken across the border for treatment in New Mexico, his family said. The boy and his parents were snatched Thursday from the gang-infested neighborhood in Ciudad Juarez  one of the deadliest cities in the world  after members of a New Mexico Baptist church saw him near an orphanage and sought help. The parents of the child, identified by officials only as Jose to protect his family, said the tumor on his shoulder and neck has grown so large that it affects his eyesight and could move into his heart. With no money for medical care, the family sought treatment in Juarez and El Paso, but did not receive any help removing the tumor, which has afflicted Jose since birth. \n In November 2014, doctors in New Mexico successfully removed Jose's tumor: removed \n\nAn 11-year-old Mexican boy who had been suffering from a massive tumor and came to New Mexico for treatment has had the growth removed. Kristean Alcocer of the First Baptist Church of Rio Rancho said the boy underwent surgery at the University of New Mexico Children's Hospital to remove the tumor from his neck, shoulder and torso area. Alcocer says the surgery lasted a more than 12 hours and involved 25 medical professionals.\n Images such as this one are carefully selected by Facebook scammers preying on the sympathies of social media users. Many folks believe that sharing the image is harmless: If the claim is true, the child is helped; and if it's false, only a small amount of their time was wasted. But these types of hoaxes are typically lures for the distribution of malware as well as clickjacking, clickbaiting, and like-farming activities, made all the more reprehensible for their dishonest and unauthorized use of such photographs.

        "justification": "Claim:  Senator John Kerry's wife owns Heinz, a company that outsources much of its work abroad.  \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2004] Factories located at: Taipei, Taiwan (makes Heinz baby foods) Dublin, Ireland; Paris, France; Dovarmenez, France; Lisbon, Portugal; Madrid, Spain; Milan, Italy; Monguzzo, Italy; Athens, Greece; Warsaw, Poland; Pudliszki, Poland; Wodzislaw, Poland; Miedzychod, Poland; Moscow, Russia;\nGeorgievisk, Russia; Cairo, Egypt; Tel Aviv, Israel; Haifa, Isreal; Elst, The Netherlands and 6 other plants there; Brussels, Belgium; Dusseldorf, Germany; Seesen, Germany; Turnhout, Belgium; Rovereto, Italy; Chateaurenand, France; North York, Ontario, Canada; Wheatley, Ontario, Canada; Caracas,Venezuela; San Jose, Costa Rica; Johannesburg, South Africa; Gaborone, Botswana;\nHarare, Zimbabwe; Cheguta, Zimbabwe; Wellington, South Africa; Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Republic of Singapore; Auckland, New Zealand; Tokyo, Japan; Guangzhov, People's Republic of China (makes infant cereal); Qingdao, People's Republic of China (makes infant foods, ketchup, mayonnaise\n& puree); Inchon, South Korea (makes Heinz products and StarKist); Bangkok, Thailand; Mumbai, India; Jakarta, Indonesia; Surabaya, Indonesia; Manila, Philippines; Wanchai, Hong Kong.  Also recently purchased from Bordens these products: Classico Pasta Sauce; Aunt Millies Pasta Sauce; Mrs. Grass Receipt Soups; Wylers Bouillons & Soups. Think of the conflict of interest a President would have who's wife owns business interests in all of these countries and others. Pass it on!!!!\n \n Origins:  In 1995, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts wed Teresa Heinz, whom he first met at an Earth Day rally in 1990.  Born   Teresa Simes-Ferreira in Mozambique to Portuguese parents, Mrs. Kerry was previously married for 25 years to Henry John Heinz III, who was a member of the founding family of the H.J. Heinz Company and represented Pennsylvania for twenty years in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate prior to his death in a plane crash in 1991.  Mrs. Kerry inherited a Heinz family fortune estimated at over $500 million. H.J. Heinz Although Senator Kerry has been critical of the Bush administration for rewarding \"Benedict Arnold CEOs\" who move \"profits and jobs overseas,\" the above-quoted attempt to link Kerry (through his wife) with the very outsourcing he decries is flawed in two major ways.  First off, Teresa Heinz Kerry does not \"own the Heinz Corporation\"  she has no involvement whatsoever with the management or operations of the H.J. Heinz Company, nor does she own anything close to a controlling interest of the company's stock.  According to Heinz itself, the Heinz family trust which Mrs. Kerry inherited sold most of its shares of Heinz stock back in 1995 and currently holds less than a 4% interest in the company: Heinz \n There is no connection between any philanthropic programs of the H.J. Heinz Company and its Foundation and the Heinz family interests (including the Howard Heinz Endowment, the Vira Heinz Endowment, and the Heinz Family Philanthropies).\n  \n\n (A 4% stake in a company as large as Heinz still represents a considerable amount of money, but it isn't nearly large enough a share to give the holder any significant control or influence over the company's business decisions.) Moreover, the Heinz Company's operations are not an example of the type of outsourcing that is currently a hot political issue (i.e., sending out work to offshore companies to provide services which a company might otherwise have employed its own staff to perform).  Heinz is a U.S.-based global business which sells its products in dozens of other countries, and like other food companies it has to localize some of its production at factories located in its foreign market areas. (It makes little sense from either an economic or a freshness standpoint to be shipping fruits and vegetables and/or finished food products halfway around the world rather than producing them locally.)  One wouldn't expect, for example, every can and bottle of Coca-Cola sold anywhere in the world  whether it be Australia, China, or Portugal  to be produced by U.S. bottlers.) As the H.J. Heinz Company notes, well over half its sales come from foreign markets, and it therefore operates overseas facilities to serve those markets: \n \n\n Last updated:  2 September 2007\n  \n\n    \n \n",

The message was typically worded like this:   If you have a school-aged student in need of breakfast and lunch this summer, simply text FOOD to 877877 and receive a message back with a location closest to where they can get free summer meals. Even if you aren't in need, someone else's kids are. No child deserves to go hungry, ever. This is a real phone number, a real program, and an accurate message.

To use the service, text \"FOOD\" to 877-877 and enter your zip code when prompted. Spanish-speakers can also text \"COMIDA\" to 877-877. You can also locate registered, licensed free meal providers using this interactive map on the USDA website. interactive map Unfortunately, your nearest free meal provider may not be in your town.

The summer program is federally funded and administered by the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, which also runs the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program during the academic year, as well as the Child and Adult Care Food Program and the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. According to a spokesperson for the No Kid Hungry campaign, the Summer Food Service Program served 177 million free meals at 47,816 sites across the U.S. in 2016.",

It warned that if you get a text message from a range of unknown numbers and with a suspicious link for collecting your item: alerted users Dont click! The text message is not from Amazon and it is the latest in a long list of impersonation scams that have been happening since the start of the pandemic, often using Amazons brand. The bogus raffle and suspicious link are part of a con used to trick people into visiting a phishing website, where they unwittingly share account credentials as well as personal and financial information with fraudsters. According to Amazon, any customer who receives a questionable email, text or call from a person impersonating Amazon or an Amazon employee should report them to Amazon customer service. Amazon investigates these complaints and will take action, if warranted. You can submit suspicious information to stop-spoofing@amazon.com. Amazon also offers a page to help identify if an email, text or phone call is really from Amazon. BBB also included a screenshot of a message similar to the one received by our editor, except the recipient was told that they came third in the raffle. When our editor reported the number that texted her to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), it recommended a number of tips to block spam messages. The tips can be read here.

FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, December 2014] \nHi This has been popping up on Facebook for a while now so I thought you'd like to know about it. It's about Jumbone, a dog treat from Pedigree (Mars) and has all the hallmarks of a hoax - vague, lacking in verifiable facts and SHARE THIS OR YOUR PET WILL DIE!!!1!11!. It's gaining momentum.   Origins:  On 18 December 2014, a Facebook user posted the following vague warning about Pedigree brand Jumbone dog treats to the social network: \n\nURGENT. Don't give your dogs these. Pedigree Uk are re-calling them. You need to contact them if your dog has had one/been poorly. Please let all your doggy friends and family know.\n\n This warning apparently stemmed from a single, unsubstantiated item posted to Facebook a month earlier by a pet owner who claimed her dog had become seriously ill due to consumption of Jumbones:  The warning resonated with dog lovers on Facebook, and the message was shared tens of thousands of times in the span of a few days. On 22 December 2014 the official Twitter account for Pedigree UK addressed the Jumbone warning message, stating that the claim about a recall was false: addressed \n\nThese reports are false. We can confirm that there are no problems with Pedigree Jumbone. It's safe to eat and we pride ourselves on producing nutritious food that meets the highest quality and safety standards.\n\n  \n\n\n\n  Last updated:  22 December 2014\n ",

        "justification": "Claim:  You can make up to $75 per hour processing refunds for FedEx and UPS. \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2003] \n\n\nIf you're still looking for a real Home Based Business I'm pretty sure you'll like what we've got. How would you like to make $75 per hour processing FedEX and UPS refunds from your home computer.\nIf you're anything like most people I talk to, you'd love to work from home  if the business was REAL. Well, this is the REAL DEAL . . . click on the link below to access the FREE REPORT! I want to assure you this opportunity has NOTHING to do with MLM, internet marketing, affiliate programs, or any goofy scheme where you're required to recruit or sell anything  it's simply an incredible business that's made possible by a closely guarded SECRET of the shipping industry. We have successful Refund Processors all over the country. These are NOT mammoth companies with multi-million dollar marketing budgets, rather these are regular people just like you who started out with this software and turned it into a profitable success . . . and most of them paid $298 for the exact same package that you can purchase today for just $77.\n Origins:  One concept that generally holds true for all fantastic money-making schemes is this: those  who truly knew a \"secret\" to making $75 per hour wouldn't be sharing it with you  they'd be using it to make money themselves and keeping it a secret from others in order to maximize their share of the profit pie.  If someone offers to sell you a fabulous money-making \"secret\" for $77, as is the case here, you can bet your bottom dollar that the true secret behind the seller's financial success is duping suckers into paying $77 for a worthless product or information of dubious value. What's being hawked here is a software package that processes airbills and produces reports listing packages which were delivered late.  Most package delivery services such as FedEx or UPS guarantee on-time delivery and promise refunds for late deliveries, so presumably all the items identified on a report produced by this software would be eligible for refunds.  According to one sales pitch, this is how the home-based entrepreneur supposedly makes his $75 per hour: \n\nABC company sends 200 FedEx overnight packages per week. On average 7% of the packages are late. FedEx guarantees on time delivery. In this case, a refund is owed on 14 packages (7% of 200). Take 14 packages times $17 (cost to send package) and you come up with $238. So, $238 is owed by FedEx in refunds to ABC company. Our software produces a report that tells you how many packages ABC is owed a credit on (14) and also the total amount of refund owed ($238) this takes 2-5 minutes. Then you simply call FedEx (on a toll free #) and request the refund of $238 (FedEx asks for the the airbill number to verify that the refund is due); and they credit the account, this only takes 30 minutes. You bill ABC for $119 (50% of the recovered money). You make $119 in approximately 35 minutes and don't forget, you process their shipping refunds every week!\n Theoretically this program could work, but there's one large catch to it: You, the entrepreneur, have to find companies like ABC  companies that ship lots of packages by FedEx, are willing to share their airbills with you, and are amenable to allowing you to process their refunds and keep a share of the proceeds for yourself. Suffice it to say there aren't many companies that fit this bill.  FedEx clients can track and verify package deliveries (and request refunds for late deliveries) for free on the FedEx web site, so those clients have no real need to pay someone to do it for them.  Even if the process were too cumbersome for clients to handle manually, they still wouldn't need to pay you to do it for them; they could simply purchase the same software product themselves for $77 and have one of their $8 per hour employees run a report and make a phone call to FedEx once a day or so.    The bottom line: the only people making money from \"refund processing\" software are those who are selling it to gullible buyers.

        ],
        "justification": "Scammers and malware purveyors are always looking for ways to entice online users into following web links that will lead those victims into the traps set for them, and offers of free airline tickets are prime bait in that pursuit of prey.  Airline tickets are something nearly everyone uses and have considerable value, but their non-material nature and the fact that they're not tremendously expensive (compared to, say, a new car) makes it seem plausible to the public that they're something a business might actually be giving away for free as part of an advertising promotion.  The name of Southwest Airlines, a major U.S. airline which is also the world's largest low-cost carrier, has frequently been invoked in various online \"free ticket\" giveaway scams in recent years.  In February 2016, social media users encountered posts that appeared to be from Southwest Airlines, offering to give away four tickets to Las Vegas and $5,000 spending money to Facebook users who shared and liked a page.  The primary type of free ticket fraud is the \"sweepstakes scam,\" which intended to lure victims into completing numerous surveys, disclosing a good deal of personal information, and then agreeing to sign up for costly, difficult-to-cancel  \"Reward Offers\" hidden in the fine print.  The scammers spread links via e-mail and Facebook that purport to offer free air travel tickets to those who follow those links. These web pages (which are not operated or sponsored by Southwest Airlines) typically ask the unwary to click what appear to be Facebook \"share\" buttons and post comments to the scammer's site (which is really a ruse to dupe users into spreading the scam by sharing it with all of their Facebook friends). Those who follow such instructions are then led into a set of pages prompting them to input a fair amount of personal information (including name, age, address, and phone numbers), complete a lengthy series of surveys, and finally sign up (and commit to paying) for at least two \"Reward Offers\" (e.g., Netflix subscriptions, credit report monitoring services, prepaid credit cards): \nPursuant to the Terms & Conditions, you are required to complete 2 of the Reward Offers from the above. You will need to meet all of the terms and conditions to qualify for the shipment of the reward. For credit card offers, you must activate your card by making a purchase, transferring a balance, or making a cash advance. For loan offers you must close and fund the loan. For home security and satellite tv offers you must have the product installed. You may not cancel your participation in more than a total of 2 Reward Offers within 30 days of any Reward Offer Sign-Up Date as outlined in the Terms & Conditions (the Cancellation Limit).\n Not only that, but the fine print on the \"free\" tickets offers typically states that by accepting its terms, the user agrees to receive telemarketing phone calls and text messages from a variety of different companies:  Similar phony free ticket lures are used to spread malware.    In those versions of the scam, those who attempt to reach the URL provided for the purpose of claiming the free tickets are instead victimized by a Facebook \"lifejacking\" attack, a malicious script that takes over a user's Facebook profile without their knowledge and propagates itself to their friends' accounts as well. lifejacking Southwest Airlines has responded to such scams by issuing messages on Twitter that read: \"Hey folks! There is a scam being passed around on Facebook about a free ticket offer from SWA. Please don't click or share the links!\" As well, Southwest spokesperson Christi McNeill has said of these attempts to defraud that \"We are aware of the scam for free tickets being spread across Facebook. This offer is in no way affiliated with Southwest Airlines and we are working with Facebook to get it removed.\"  ",

        ],
        "justification": "In late 2019, readers asked us about blog posts that were widely shared on social media and falsely claimed that the reality television star Duane Chapman, known as \"Dog the Bounty Hunter,\" had died either by suicide or from a pulmonary embolism.  Those reports were false. Beginning on Nov. 20, admirers of Chapman and his late wife, Beth, who died in June after herself being the subject of death hoaxes, began posting tributes to him and sharing one of two blog posts.  hoaxes The first purported to be hosted by a website with the domain name whatnow.actual-events.com, but when internet users clicked on the story on social media, they were redirected to the domain newspanel.suzeraincollections.com. There, the story carried the headline \"Duane 'Dog' Chapman Died of Pulmonary Embolism. He Didn't Survive His Second Attack. He Was 66 -- WGN.\"  first   The highly dubious website falsely attributed the claim about Chapman's death to WGN America, a real U.S. television network that broadcast the Chapmans' most recent reality show \"Dog's Most Wanted.\" The hoax article also misleadingly used WGN America's logo in a sharebait video that purported to be a television news report about Chapman's death, but that paused after a few seconds and required users to share the article on social media in order to continue watching:   In reality, WGN America had no connection to the story and did not report on Chapman's death in November 2019, because Chapman did not die in November 2019. The specific claim that Chapman had died from a pulmonary embolism (a blocked artery in the lungs) was rather insidious. At first glance, it appeared especially plausible to many fans of the television star because he was in fact diagnosed with that very problem in September 2019. diagnosed The second blog post shared by social media users was even more distasteful than the first. It falsely and misleadingly used the logo of BBC News, a highly reputable and widely trusted information source, to report that Chapman had taken his own life.  In this instance, social media users shared an article that appeared to be hosted on the domain bbc-newsroom.actualeventstv.com, but which redirected to news-room.easystepsdiy.info. On social media, the post carried the headline \"Duane 'Dog' Chapman Died of Suicide After Depression Attack on His Sickness -- BBC News\" but when users redirected to the source, the article's headline proclaimed: shared proclaimed \"Breaking: (Actual Suicide Video) Duane 'Dog' Chapman Died of Suicide After Depression Attack on His Sickness -- BBC News.\" Despite the extremely distasteful claim that the video in the article contained footage of Chapman's suicide, it contained nothing of the sort and, just as in the first article, the video stopped after a second or two and required viewers to share the post on social media in order to continue watching.     The claim that Chapman had taken his own life was, like the claim he had died of a pulmonary embolism, particularly insidious. In the season finale of \"Dog's Most Wanted,\" broadcast by WGN America on Nov. 6, Chapman spoke about the recent death of his wife from cancer, and the considerable difficulty he was experiencing in coping with her loss.  At one moment in the episode, he reportedly discussed how he had contemplated taking his own life, such was his grief. People magazine quoted Chapman as saying: People \"I just hope that I dont live very much longer without her, because now she made the first step, shes through the gate,\" he added. She paved a way for me. I want to take a [god damn] pain pill so bad. I feel like if I did something to myself right now and passed away suicidal and I got to heaven and was like, Hi honey, and would she go, You [dumb ass], why would you do that? Or would she go, Wow, youre here. Ill be like Of course Im here. You left me. Im here. So, am I obligated to do that?  Because of that widely reported revelation, a report that Chapman had died by suicide would have appeared somewhat plausible to many readers.  The dubious nature of the websites involved, and the absence of any corroborating evidence or reports by actual news organizations, meant that some readers would have immediately recognized the stories as hoaxes. However, a significant number were taken in by them, and shared them on social media, to the extent that Chapman himself intervened. He provided the gossip website TMZ a photograph of himself holding the Nov. 19 edition of the Denver Post, and a handwritten sign that read \"I'm alive!\" Chapman then posted a screenshot of that article to his own Instagram page the next day. photograph Instagram If you need help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255.

It appears that this photograph was first posted to Flickr by EMS Flight Crew, an international community of air medical professionals, in October 2010. That posting did not include any information about where or when this accident occurred, nor any information about what caused the crash (such as texting and driving.) We assume that the driver was alive when emergency crews first arrived on the scene, as the photograph was accompanied by a number of tags such as \"air evac,\" \"air rescue,\" and \"life flight.\" Flickr Although it was originally posted and shared simply because it is an image of a shocking car accident, by 2012 it was being used to dissuade drivers from texting and driving.

Texting while driving is certainly a dangerous (and illegal) activity that could result in a similar car crash to the one depicted above. However, there's no evidence that this specific car accident was actually caused by a distracted driver. The story about the bisected driver clutching her phone was likely manufactured in an attempt to scare drivers from using their phones while driving.

This is the full text of the alert, according to which these apps are controlled by \"extreme hackers\" out to invade your privacy: WARNING FACEBOOK There is a website link traveling around Facebook at an extraordinary rate which allows you \"to see what you would look like as the opposite sex\" and also one that lets you see what you look like \"as a bald person\". DO NOT enter these links, they are controlled by extreme hackers who are now gaining control of people's personal information and selling it on the black market. As soon as you have clicked share to Facebook it gives these hackers instant access to your own personal details and puts your family and friends personal details at risk. PLEASE SHARE TO MAKE YOUR FRIENDS AWARE As is typical of such alerts, certain features of actual Facebook apps that access personal information in users' profiles have been misconstrued as illegal and the security threat they pose is exaggerated. A number of apps of this kind are constantly promoted on Facebook. This example poses the question, \"What would you look like as a bald person?\":   Clicking on the link opens an external web page that instructs the user to log in with Facebook to see the results:   This disclaimer appears in fine print at the bottom of the page: This app uses data and contents only if they are publicly available or with the consent of the users. We kindly ask you to use the app only, if other users will not be affected adversely. *Only users who have reached the age of 16 may use this free function. You agree that your picture will be transmitted to the provider FaceApp (St. Petersburg, RU) for the sole purpose of its editing and will be deleted afterwards (data protection and objection notice). Users who log in are then presented with a dialogue box informing them that certain information (typically their Facebook profile data, photos, and e-mail address) will automatically be shared with the web site if they continue (although this particular one doesn't, some apps also request permission to post on the user's Facebook page). If they choose to continue, users are then presented with a selection of photos from their Facebook page and invited to choose one for the demonstration. The app displays the chosen photo side-by-side with an altered version depicting the subject without hair, and invites the user to like the app. It is all relatively harmless, but Facebook users should take seriously all notifications to the effect that they by using the app they are granting the company that provided it access to some of their personal data. We also advise reading the Terms of Service and Privacy notifications provided by such apps (usually via links somewhere on the associated web page) for a detailed description of what you're agreeing to. By granting access to your e-mail address, for example, you're agreeing to receive marketing e-mails and/or newsletters from that company. These pages are also where you would be notified if the company plans on sharing your data with third parties. Terms of Service Privacy Facebook provides this general overview of what types of information games and apps are allowed to collect when you install them: provides Keep in mind when you install an app, you give it permission to access your public profile, which includes your name, profile pictures, username, user ID (account number), networks and any info you choose to make publicly available. You also give the app other info to personalize your experience, including your friends list, gender, age range and locale. other info In short, the companies that offer apps like these aren't typically \"hackers\" (much less \"extreme hackers,\" which sounds exciting, but we're not sure how one goes from being a mere hacker to an extreme one), nor do they sell your private data on the \"black market.\" However, when you use such apps you do grant them access to personal information in your Facebook profile, which may also be shared with third parties. The moral of the story is: Use Facebook apps cautiously, but don't buy into fear-mongering warnings about them.",

        "justification": "In early March 2021, readers alerted us to a Facebook scam that involved a Bora Bora vacation getaway. This led us to revisit Facebook pages like Las Vegas Travel that advertised a Las Vegas vacation giveaway. involved Las Vegas Travel We previously made note of the suspicious Vegas page in July 2020. At the time, we archived a post from a different, though similar one: Las Vegas Vacations. At least one of the pages had a Russian page manager. archived On July 2, we noticed that the Las Vegas Travel page had shared a post from Las Vegas Vacations. It mentioned a purported grand opening celebration for a resort. \"We're going to celebrate our grand opening by doing something special for you. We will be rewarding someone who has shared then commented by August 26th with a 7-night stay for up to 5 people in a luxury suite. Don't worry about flights and transfers, it's all included.\" shared  As of March 2021, the above post and likely many other posts like it had been deleted. This appeared to be an effort to cover the tracks of the scammers so they could keep the pages alive for future fake giveaways.  Just like with the Bora Bora getaway, the Las Vegas pages were illegitimate. They should be avoided for the possibility of phishing, identity theft, and other potential consequences. We strongly suggest against submitting any personal information to links on these pages. Since July, the Las Vegas Travel page attempted to expand its scheme to Instagram. Meanwhile, the Las Vegas Vacations page was still running the \"Grand Opening Celebration\" scam. expand still running  The Las Vegas Vacations Facebook page was created in July 2020. It was purportedly managed from the United Kingdom and Germany.  For almost a year and a half, Facebook failed to take action on the illegitimate pages. The Las Vegas Travel Facebook page was created in 2019. As of March 2021, it had around 250,000 followers. Las Vegas Vacations was created in July 2020. It was building toward 50,000 followers. The scam appeared to work in a similar way to the Bora Bora getaway. In fact, the same person or group of people appeared to manage both fake giveaways. We came to this conclusion after noticing similarities in dates and text on the pages. Further, the same .xyz domain website was listed. Bora Bora getaway Here's how the scam worked. First, Facebook users were asked to like, share, and comment with the word: \"WIN.\" This February - We are giving away 10 nights at the The Venetian Las Vegas for 5 people. Includes Flights, Accommodation & Transfers. You will have 2 years to use the holiday! To participate:\n1. Like\n2. Share\n3. Comment: \"WIN\"\nCloses 28th February at 9pm. Next, a personal Facebook profile that appeared to be a page responded to each entrant. (A Facebook profile is for an individual person. A page is for companies, bands, personalities, etc.) The response to each entrant read: \"You win. Check my profile.\" The profile named \"Las Vegas-Nevanda\" had a name in its Facebook URL: facebook.com/titis.ariandini. It read: \"Titis Ariandini.\"  \"Honey, just a reminder that we're having dinner on Friday with the Vegas-Nevandas.\"  Entrants who clicked to view the \"Las Vegas-Nevanda\" profile were led to yet another post. It advised Facebook users to visit a link to register for a prize.  The post also told readers \"this is original and official.\" How reassuring.  One Facebook user named Jason appeared to believe the scam giveaway was real. In the same comment, he also referred to effective measures to reduce the chance of more deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic as a \"communist shutdown.\" The link in the post led to a registration page that mirrored scammy websites we've seen before.  Needless to say, this is not a registration page from a real Las Vegas resort.  The registration page resulted in affiliate marketing links for streaming movie websites. This was where the Bora Bora getaway pages ended as well. The point of the affiliate marketing was for the scammers to make commissions on signups on the streaming movie websites. Again, it was also possible that the scam involved phishing, identity theft, and other dangerous outcomes. We found a number of other pages that shared the Las Vegas scams. They appeared to be in the same network of Facebook pages. They included: Maldives 2021, Bora Bora Vacations, Cancun Tours, New York Christmas Vacations, Maldives Getaways, Santorini - Greece, Package Holidays 2021, Dominican Republic Vacations 2021, Bali Tourism, Visit Hawaii, Seychelles Holidays, Tourism Bali, Cabo Tourism, Cabo San Lucas 2021, and Bali Holidays. Maldives 2021 Bora Bora Vacations Cancun Tours New York Christmas Vacations Maldives Getaways Santorini - Greece Package Holidays 2021 Dominican Republic Vacations 2021 Bali Tourism Visit Hawaii Seychelles Holidays Tourism Bali Cabo Tourism Cabo San Lucas 2021 Bali Holidays We noticed that some of these pages were scrubbed of their past scam posts. This allowed the page managers to plead innocence and continue running their post-and-delete operations. Further, this list of pages perhaps only scratched the surface of the entire scam empire. In sum, the giveaways that showed up on the Las Vegas Travel and Las Vegas Vacations Facebook pages were not legitimate. Facebook failed to take action on these scams despite their existence dating back to at least 2019. As a rule, it's always good to look for the \"verified\" badge on Facebook pages. \"verified\" badge",

        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  A Bath & Body Works manager refused to serve a group of disabled students.  UNDETERMINED Example:  [Collected via e-mail, November 2014] \nPLEASE DO NOT DO BUSINESS AT THE CHESTERFIELD MALL BATH & BODY WORK!! I was very disappointed today while on a field trip with my Special Education students. They were given an assignment to find stores on their own and locate a product and write down information about the product. This seems like an easy task, however this is an important skill these students are still learning. As we got ready to walk into Bath & Body Works we were met by a worker who told us we were not welcome to come in the front door. We stopped in our tracks and I told him who we were and what we were doing. He told me we were not welcome in the store. He then pointed out to the sensor at the entrance and told me that if the three students and I walked in the door of his store that I would hurt the sales for the store since we couldn't buy anything. He had no clue that I was going to buy something. He told us we could not enter so I explained to the students that we were not welcome. They did not understand why. I then found out that a few other groups tried to go into the store and were met with the same rudeness. I can't believe they would treat these disabled students like this! If you have a family member or a friend who has a disability or know someone with a disability please share this. This filed trip turned out to be more than a life skills and social skills lesson, they were exposed to discrimination!!Please share this with everyone you know!! People with disabilities do have money to spend, and they did spend money on our trip today!!\n Origins:  On 6 November 2014, a Facebook user posted the above-quoted claim about her experience at the Chesterfield Mall in Missouri. According to her account, although other stores in the mall had warmly welcomed her party, the manager of the Chesterfield Bath & Body Works was uniquely unkind to her small group of disabled students. Not long after the first post, the woman updated her Facebook page to link to a news story about a similar claim involving a Bath & Body Works store in Alabama. Additionally, she reposted the statuses of two fellow teachers or school staff members who described the same initial claim stemming from the students' visit to Bath & Body Works on 6 November 2014: Alabama \n\nI am respectfully asking each of you to boycott the Bath & Body Works at Chesterfield Mall (the actual mall, not the outlet). We took our students to the mall to work on a life skills scavenger hunt today and the man that was working there prevented three of our groups of students and paras (1para and 2 students... not large groups) from entering the store. He was rude and said it would drive away his customers. He treated everyone very rudely and tried to cover himself when I went to confront him and get his information. We have done this scavenger hunt before and have never run in to any other problems. In fact, everyone else from the food court to the carousel to the other retailers up to the mall manager (yes, i took it that far ) were more than respectful. Whenever you are doing your holiday shopping or any time for that matter, please consider going to Chesterfield Mall and skipping that store. I will be contacting corporate tomorrow. In this day and age, it is downright disgusting that anyone with special needs would be treated in such manner. Please spread the word to not patronize this store. I'd like for him to understand that this type of discrimination will not be accepted.\n \n FYI Our special needs students had the opportunity to take a community access field trip to Chesterfield Mall today! What a wonderful time they had ordering their lunch, riding the carousel and working on social skills. Unfortunately they also experienced the cruelty of discrimination at Bath & Body Works. Three groups of no more than 3-4 ( including at least one staff member) were met by an employee with arms outstretched refusing them access to the store! They were told only purchasing customers were allowed in and they would hurt his business! Apparently our kiddos didn't \"look\" like they were there to buy anything from their store. Shame on him! Our own Casey Brown calmly approached him to inquiry about the treatment of the students and was equally treated rudely! Everyday we stress the importance of treating each other with kindness, respect and understanding with these children. And yet this man clearly never got them memo.  So maybe rethink your shopping trip at Christmas time and bypass the Chesterfield Bath & Body Works! I have a feeling that boycotting that store will hurt his sales much more than our presence in his precious store! And by the way, corporate office, mall manager and other B&B Works locations have been contacted by several of us.\n The original claim about the Chesterfield Bath & Body Works manager has been shared tens of thousands of times since it was first posted on 6 November 2014. It's worth noting all three accounts are different versions of the same single incident and are not indicative of any wide-ranging claims about Bath & Body Works' treatment of disabled individuals. On 7 November 2014, a statement posted by the company to the main Bath & Body Works Facebook page addressed social media controversy over the Chesterfield claim: Facebook \n\nDear fans: We appreciate your concerns regarding the information that has been shared about Chesterfield Missouri Mall. Please be assured that we take this situation very seriously and are investigating this matter in an effort to resolve it as soon as possible.\n\n The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported: reported \n\nThe employee apparently assumed the group wouldn't be buying anything and was concerned that if they walked past the sensor that tracks the number of people in the store each day, it would hurt their sales percentage.\n\n Last updated:  8 November 2014\n ",

That is actually an image of singer Patti LaBelle performing at the \"Women of Soul: In Performance at the White House concert in 2014: performing Yep here's video pic.twitter.com/IIkMDuKB7e pic.twitter.com/IIkMDuKB7e  Zachary Pleat (@zpleat) August 16, 2018 August 16, 2018  Jessica Santostefano, Vice President -- Media Desk at Fox News, issued an apology for the mistake: apology We sincerely apologize to Aretha Franklins family and friends.

Isden wrote: At first I thought the gemsbok must have walked through the web, but on closer inspection it was clear that it was much more intricate than that, and there were living spiders in the webs too.

        "justification": "A phenomenon know as \"like-farming\" refers to unscrupulous online activity in which fraudsters post salacious material in order to generate as many likes, shares, and comments as possible. As the popularity of these posts and pages grows, so do the opportunities to scam social media users. For instance, a fraudster may edit a post to include a malware link or request personal information  or, if the audience has grown large enough, change the page's focus entirely and start selling spammy products.  In January 2020, the popular grocery chain Aldi was used in one such scam. A fraudulent post from a page resembling the official Aldi USA Facebook page promised everyone who shared or commented on it the chance to win a year's worth of free groceries: This post did not originate with the official Aldi Facebook page, and the grocery chain is not giving away a year of free groceries to any Facebook fans who like, comment, or share this post.   For starters, the post does not appear on the official Aldi USA Facebook page, nor on any of the store's other social media pages. We also checked the grocery chain's website for any mention of a grocery giveaway, but this too-good-to-be-true deal is not listed among Aldi's specials.  official Aldi USA Facebook page social media Aldi's specials Lastly, this fraudulent Facebook post follows the same script of dozens of other like-farming scams: It makes a big promise (a year of free groceries) in order to entice readers, then makes a simple request (to comment or share) to ensure that this post reaches a larger audience. The post is also light on specifics (11 pm in what time zone? And what Sunday?) and originated on a page unaffiliated with the grocery chain.  Here's how the Better Business Bureau described like-farming scams: What Exactly is Like-Farming? Like-farming on Facebook is a technique in which scammers create an eye-catching post designed to get many likes and shares. Posts often give people emotional reasons to click, like, and share, such as adorable animals, sick children, or political messages. For example, some posts claim that Facebook will donate money for every comment or share. As more people like and share the post, it appears in more news feeds, giving the post a much wider audience. Why Do Scammers Farm for Likes? As with many scams, like-farming has several different aims. When scammers ask you to register in order to win a free iPad or a free flight, this is a way to steal your personal information. Other versions can be more complex. Often, the post itself is initially harmless  albeit completely fictional. But when the scammer collects enough likes and shares, they will edit the post and add something malicious. Thats often a link to a website that downloads malware to your machine. Other times, once scammers reach their target number of likes, they strip the pages original content and use it to promote spammy products. They may also resell the page on the black market. These buyers can use it to spam followers or harvest the information Facebook provides. This is not the first time that Aldi has been used for this type of scam. In 2015 (and again in 2019), a scam post offering free Aldi coupons was circulated on social media.  free Aldi coupons We reached out to Aldi for more details and will update this article if more information becomes available.

The earliest iteration of the post, on 4 February 2018, emanated from a Facebook user in Nigeria, who posted:    The post was accompanied by a photograph of the alleged assailant:   Besides lacking much in the way of context, the photo can be found on at least two online dating sites, with divergent information: The man is identified as a resident of Casablanca on Wamba; but on JeContacte he's described as hailing from Cameroon. Wamba; JeContacte However, the web site The Zambian Observer claimed that he was Congolese in a post accusing him of committing several murders: post Zambia shares a border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in December 2017 a reported thousands of Congolese refugees made their way into Zambia to escape from violence in their own country. The article appears to be using the man as an anti-immigrant scapegoat and a way to attack a specific politician. reported Other iterations of the post placed the man in Freeport, Jamaica; Washington D.C.; Toledo, Ohio; and in New York City, where some social media users posted the picture and the original caption, adding the phrase \"my friend from the DA'S office in Brooklyn just sent me this. Share it for your safety\":   A spokesperson for the actual Brooklyn District Attorney's office told us that they \"know nothing\" about the person in the picture or the allegations. But as often happens around social media, users shared the claim while admitting that they had no idea whether they were helping the spread of misinformation:       But there has yet to be actual corroboration of any of the claims surrounding the unnamed man; police officials in both New York City and Washington D.C. told us that they had never heard of the post or any allegations about a \"murder cab.\" The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles said that \"2465RB\" did not match any license plate attached to a taxi or any other sort of vehicle. And a spokesperson for the Toledo Police Department told us, \"We have looked into this and it is not credible.\" We also contacted police in Zambia seeking comment, but had not heard back as of time of publication. The fact that the claim spans several continents and countries suggest that this is a false rumor, as does the Zambian Observer's claim that the man was doing \"ritual killings.\" If this man were murdering people in Brooklyn (or Toledo, or Washington D.C., or Freeport et al), and if law enforcement had his photograph, it would have been reported in major U.S. newspapers, police would know about it, and official government sources would have published warnings.

This reality has led to rumors that President Donald Trump's administration, or some of its members, have a financial interest in promoting specific tests as opposed to others that would be more widely available or more easily distributed. more widely available One claim that has emerged in this vein came from a report by Raw Story that asserted \"the Kushner family is trying to cash in on the pandemic that could kill millions of us.\" The basis for this claim concerns the health insurance startup Oscar co-founded by Jared Kushners brother, Joshua Kushner. Jared Kushner is the son-in-law of and special adviser to Trump. report On March 13, 2020, Oscar announced that it would be launching a testing-center locator for COVID-19: announced Today, Oscar, a tech-driven health insurance company, launched the first testing center locator for COVID-19 in the U.S., featuring more than 100 centers today. It is accessible to the general public and more testing centers are being added every day. However, the details of Oscar's testing locator have been described incorrectly in several viral social media posts alleging profiteering from the Kushners during the coronavirus pandemic. A well-shared post by a user named \"Boston Judy,\" for example, asserted that \"we didn't have testing because the Trump family circle wanted to wait till they could make a profit.\" well-shared post   Even if this assertion had merit, the actions Oscar took merely help locate unaffiliated testing centers. As an insurance company, Oscar does not manufacture, perform, analyze, or sell any actual COVID-19 test. Further, the test-center locator that Oscar developed is open to the general public and is not limited to people who get insurance through Oscar. Once a user has taken a short survey, the locator will provide the closest locations for testing in areas in which they operate. While the service also acts as a promotion for the company, it can serve as a testing center locator for any interested party. open \"Boston Judy\" later clarified that Oscar was not producing tests, but that the company would get to \"bill the feds for evaluating people for COVID and referring them to a testing center if they meet the criteria [for testing].\" While the legislation that would allow for such a reimbursement likely will include a fund for covering the cost of these tests, the legislation has not yet been finalized, and it's unclear that it would really be a windfall for Oscar, either. On March 13, 2020, U.S. House Democrats and the White House reached a deal on a package of legislation that included a requirement that insurance companies cover the full cost of COVID-19 with no cost sharing. As described by the Brookings Institute, this legislation, if and when it is passed by the Senate and signed by the president: described Would offer financial support to state governments by temporarily increasing the share of Medicaid spending financed by the federal government, require almost all forms of health insurance to cover COVID-19 testing without cost-sharing, and create mechanisms to pay for COVID-19 testing for uninsured people. In other words, while the government will likely be subsidizing insurance companies like Oscar, they are doing so to cover losses incurred by the requirement for full reimbursement to members. These laws, and the federal reimbursement they would authorize, would apply to any health insurance company in America, not only Oscar. would apply Joshua Kushner co-founded Oscar in 2012. His venture capital firm, Thrive Capital, holds a significant ownership share. According to financial-disclosure forms released by Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, covering the year 2018, the couple owned and received profit from shares of Thrive: co-founded financial- disclosure   This document also appears to assert that the couple divested from Thrive during the 2018 financial year:   Under federal law, executive branch employees are eligible to defer paying capital gains taxes on investments sold to comply with conflict of interest requirements.

But, she told us, his divestment does little to alter the appearance of a conflict of interest or reduce the risk of potential corruption, especially if he is using his public office to promote the private interests of his brother or giving him preferential access. The similarities between the Trump Administrations announcement of a website designed to locate COVID-19 testing centers and the website released by Oscar have been a source of speculation about undue access on Joshua Kushners part. source speculation That being said, the assertion that the Kushners as a family are involved in the business of COVID-19 testing is not entirely accurate. The company's coronavirus response so far is limited to an online form that allows users to find a testing location if their symptoms call for it. Health insurance companies are likely to be reimbursed for covering the cost of COVID-19 testing once legislation is passed, but this would apply to all insurance providers, not just Oscar.

        "justification": "In May 2014 Facebook announced they would be rolling out an \"Identify TV and Music\" feature that would allow users who access the social media platform through their cell phones to identify and tag music or television programs playing in their area. When a user begins to compose a status update, Facebook will activate the phone's microphone, filter out live conversations, and try to detect and identify audio programming. If a matching song is found, Facebook will include a sample of the music in the status; if a matching television program is found, Facebook will label the specific season and episode \"so you can avoid any spoilers\": announced When writing a status update  if you choose to turn the feature on  you'll have the option to use your phone's microphone to identify what song is playing or what show or movie is on TV. That means if you want to share that you're listening to your favorite Beyonc track or watching the season premiere of Game of Thrones, you can do it quickly and easily, without typing. If you share music, your friends can see a 30-second preview of the song. For TV shows, the story in News Feed will highlight the specific season and episode youre watching, so you can avoid any spoilers and join in conversations with your friends after you've caught up. Facebook said the digital fingerprinting feature would be opt-in only, meaning users would have to give the program permission to start. Once activated, an icon on the face of the phone would indicate that the microphone was active and the phone was listening. Users who opted in could still choose to turn off the feature on a post-by-post basis. (Audio fingerprinting would only be available in the United States and only via iOS and Android mobile apps; it would not function if Facebook were accessed through a browser.)   \nFacebook's announcement was later updated to address rumors that the new app would listen in on, and store, user conversations: Myth: The feature listens to and stores your conversations. Fact: Nope, no matter how interesting your conversation, this feature does not store sound or recordings. Facebook isn't listening to or storing your conversations. Here's how it works: if you choose to turn the feature on, when you write a status update, the app converts any sound into an audio fingerprint on your phone. This fingerprint is sent to our servers to try and match it against our database of audio and TV fingerprints. By design, we do not store fingerprints from your device for any amount of time. And in any event, the fingerprints can't be reversed into the original audio because they don't contain enough information. Myth: Facebook is always listening using your microphone. Fact: Nope, if you choose to turn this feature on, it will only use your microphone (for 15 seconds) when you're actually writing a status update to try and match music and TV. Two years later, a similar rumor erupted, holding that Facebook was listening to user conversations in order to better target advertising and content to them. rumor  Griffin, Andrew.  \"Facebook Is Using Smartphones To Listen To What People Say, Professor Suggests.\"\r\n  The Independent.  31May 2016.

        ],
        "justification": "In mid-June 2021, viral social media posts claimed a U.S. Republican congressman who has previously been accused of attempting to downplay the seriousness of the Jan. 6 Capitol attack refused to shake hands with a police officer who had tried that day to protect the federal building from the violent mob of Donald Trump supporters. seriousness of the Jan. 6 Capitol attack Donald Trump Before we unpack that accusation, some context: On June 15, the House of Representatives approved a proposal on a 406-21 vote to award the highest congressional honor to the Capitol Police and the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for protecting the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack. Jan. 6 attack. Those who voted \"no\" on the measure to recognize officers with the Congressional Gold Medal were all Republicans who said they had qualms with describing the events of Jan. 6 as an \"insurrection\" or the Capitol as a \"temple of democracy,\" among other issues, according to news reports and the congressional voting record. Republicans news reports congressional voting record The day after that vote, a group including MPD officer Michael Fanone, who was injured during the Jan. 6 attack, visited the Capitol to try to meet with the above-mentioned Republicans and share his experience of trying to fend off the mob. On an elevator during that June 16 tour, Fanone said, he introduced himself to Georgia Rep. Andrew Clyde  who is one of the aforementioned 21 Republicans  and the congressman did not shake his hand. Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who represents a portion of California's Bay Area, was among the first people to report the alleged elevator encounter on Twitter.  Twitter \"Fanone introduced himself as 'someone who fought to defend the Capitol' and put out his hand. Clyde refused to shake it,\" he tweeted June 16 around 3:30 p.m. EST.   Multiple news outlets ran with the story, including The Washington Post, which claimed in a headline: \"GOP congressman refuses to shake hands with D.C. police officer who protected the Capitol on Jan. 6.\" Multiple news outlets claimed in a headline A spokesperson for Swalwell told Snopes that Fanone had called the congressman \"immediately\" after the run-in occured to share what had happened. Then, after Swalwell's tweet went viral, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican serving Illinois, said he called the police officer, and he confirmed with him the alleged event took place. said As posts about the interaction spread rapidly online, Fanone went on CNN's \"Don Lemon Tonight\" to explain the incident for himself: CNN's Fanone: I saw Congressman Clyde standing outside of an elevator. I was there with also [Capitol Police Officer] Harry Dunn, who accompanied me throughout the Capitol, went into the elevator. I told, I, you know, greeted Congressman Clyde. I was very cordial. Harry Dunn I extended my hand to shake his hand. He just stared at me. I asked him if he was going to shake my hand, and he told me that he didn't know who I was. So, I introduced myself. I said that I was officer Micheal Fanone; that I was a D.C. Metropolitan police officer who fought on Jan. 6 to defend the Capitol and, as a result, I suffered a traumatic brain injury, as well as a heart attack, after having been tased numerous times at the base of my skull, as well as being severely beaten. At that point, the Congressman turned away from me, pulled out a cell phone. It looked like he was attempting to pull up like an audio recording app on his phone and, again, like never acknowledged me at any point. As soon as the elevator's doors open, he ran as quickly as he could like a coward. Lemon: Like a coward, didn't shake your hand. Fanone: Correct, absolutely not. In summary, Fanone told the news anchor that he extended his hand to Clyde, and the Congressman responded saying he didn't recognize the police officer. After that, Fanone said he introduced himself as a \"police officer who fought on Jan. 6 to defend the Capitol,\" and then Clyde allegedly \"turned away.\" The police officer likened the interaction to \"Clyde giving the middle finger to myself and every other member of [MPD] and U.S. Capitol Police that responded that day,\" according to a recording of his CNN appearance. No photo or video evidence existed to corroborate Fanone's story. However, Harry Dunn, a 13-year veteran of the Capitol Police, told Snopes he was in the elevator, too, and verified the key points of Fanone's CNN interview in an email to Snopes, displayed below:   In other words, he told us that both police officers \"said hello\" to the Congressman and when Fanone extended his hand, \"Rep Clyde looked down at Mike's hand and looked away almost immediately.\" Dunn's account of what happened next matched Fanone's (Fanone asked Clyde if he was going to shake his hand, Clyde said he did not know who he was, and Fanone introduced himself). \"As Mike was doing that, Clyde kept inching as close to the wall as he could,\" Dunn told Snopes. \"He was fidgeting with his phone and ... opened the video recorder mode and started to record. Mike and I looked at each other and shook our heads and we both said 'unbelievable.'\" Snopes contacted Clyde's office for his response to the accusations, but we have not heard back. (The congressman also did not respond to other news media, including The Washington Post, Business Insider, and CNN.) The Washington Post Business Insider CNN Nothing leads us to believe Fanone's story isn't accurate, and Dunn's corroboration as an eyewitness is enough to confirm the claim as true. The caveat, however, is that without the congressman's own explanation for his actions, all possible explanations for why he did not appear to accept Fanone's greeting are subjective. We only have Fanone's and Dunn's word for the claim that he was fully aware of the police officer's invitation to shake hands and consciously rejected it. It's possible that Clyde did not hear or understand Fanone's introduction, for whatever reasons. Perhaps he was wearing wireless headphones or another Bluetooth device that prevented him from hearing, for example.  Our invitation to Clyde to tell his side of the story still stands. This report was updated to include comments from Rep. Eric Swalwell's spokesperson.",

Fake News On 10 June 2018, the Last Line of Defense web site published an article positing that the Muslim mayor of Minneapolis had \"canceled the 4th of July\": article \nMayor Ahneid al Ahmed of Haskentot, Minnesota has done the unthinkable and canceled the 4th of July.

We dont hink buying a bunch of flags and fireworks and spending a day celebrating nationalism like nazis is a good idea. This was not a genuine news story about the mayor of Minneapolis, who is neither named \"Ahneid al Ahmed\" nor a Muslim. (The city's actual mayor is Jacob Frey.) The Last Line of Defense is part of a network of sites that engages in political trolling under the guise of proffering \"satire.\" Jacob Frey This junk news piece may have prompted some confusion, as it resembled a genuine news story about a nearby Minnesota city. The mayor of St. Paul did cancel the city's Independence Day firework show due to budgetary concerns: cancel St. Paul will go without the rockets red glare on Independence Day this year. Mayor Melvin Carter announced that the city wont hold a Fourth of July fireworks event. The cancellation may foreshadow of what could be a difficult budget season. Carters announcement, posted to Facebook, cited concerns about the citys budget climate. Minneapolis, on the other hand, hosted multiple firework shows on July 4th. multiple firework shows Fear-Mongering Reports About Eid al-Adha The Muslim celebration of Eid al-Adha is also referred to as the \"Feast of Sacrifice.\" The holiday, which honors Ibrahim's (Abraham's) willingness to sacrifice his son at God's command, is celebrated by Muslims around the world. In many places, Muslims observe that holiday by  sacrificing an animal and then sharing its meat with the poor: sacrificing To commemorate God's test of Ibrahim, many Muslim families sacrifice an animal and share the meat with the poor. They also are required to donate to charities that benefit the poor. Muslims also routinely exchange presents during the holiday.

It comes at the end of the annual hajj pilgrimage. It is one of the holiest days of the year for Muslims, who celebrate with prayer, shared meals and gifts.

        "sci_digest": [
            "Digital editing isn't the only method to create an interesting image. "
        ],
        "justification": "An image supposedly showing a large moon sitting perfectly in the middle of a stone arch formation is frequently circulated on social media under the title \"The Eye of the Moon in Utah.\"  The Eye of the Moon in Utah     This isn't a genuine photograph, in the sense that this scene was not visible with the naked eye. However, this isn't a digitally altered image, either. The original picture was taken by photographer Zach Cooley by using an in-camera double exposure technique. In short, Cooley snapped a photograph, then snapped a second photograph, and layered the images on top of one another. (By labeling it \"Misleading,\" we don't mean to accuse Cooley of misrepresentation. Rather, it's to point out that in many cases the image has been shared on social media with no explanation of how it was constructed.) Zach Cooley Masterclass explains: explains Double exposure photography is a technique that layers two different exposures on a single image, combining two photographs into one. Double exposure creates a surreal feeling for your photos and the two photographs can work together to convey deep meaning or symbolism. A similar technique, called a multiple exposure, is when you combine more than two exposures in a single image Cooley provided some of the technical details behind this image in their Instagram post. They wrote that they traveled to Utah in October as the moon was aligning with this arch, that they used an in-camera double exposure to create this image, and that the two images used were taken about a minute apart. Compared to what was seen with the naked eye, the moon is enlarged and centered. Instagram post Here's the original Instagram post:   Cooley writes: Happy Halloween weekend! I planned an entire vacation mostly around the fact that the moonrise would align with this arch and I could get something resembling a spooky eye on the week of Halloween. Over two nights I got some single shots and double exposures, I thought this one was best for the eye look, what do you think? Can't wait to share more with you all!\n\nIn-camera double exposure\nMoon: ?550mm?F/9?1/160sec.?ISO 160\nArch: ?250mm?F/9?1/5 sec.?ISO 160 Notes: Photos taken about a minute apart and moon was enlarged and repositioned in the process.  While the \"Eye of the Moon in Utah\" photograph gives a slightly distorted view of what you would see if you were standing next to the photographer, it isn't that far off from reality. Here's a single-exposure photograph from Cooley that shows a very similar scene:    Cooley elaborated on this in-camera double exposure technique in another Instagram post that showed a large moon over Phoenix, Arizona, writing: Double exposure effects are often achieved in Photoshop or a similar program by importing and manipulating 2 different photos. However, many digital cameras today allow you to merge multiple photos at the time you take them, but of course with none of the flexibility you get with editing software. For this image for example, I captured the city in one shot, then zoomed in and positioned the moon where I wanted it to overlay, and when I snapped that second photo the camera merged it with the first since it was in double exposure mode. Zooming in for the moon photo makes it appear larger in comparison to the city than it did in real life (4X larger in this case). This all may sound easy, but a lot of things have to be just right for this to work out.\n\nIve mentioned this before, but to be clear, I have zero issues with Photoshop - its a pretty cool tool that opens doors to infinite creativity, among other things. I'm personally just in a place where I have yet to learn how to do things like this in Photoshop, and I'm enjoying trying different things with my camera. Ive been hesitant to post this, probably most of all because I take pride in a lot of single exposure moon photos Ive taken, and I fear mixing in images like this could lead people to believe those single exposures are more of the same. Like Ive said though, I will always specify in the caption. At the end of the day, Im proud of this image too and happy to share creative work without walls, even if its not purist photography. Im definitely wanting feedback on all this, from photographers and not photographers alike, so please let me know what you think! And thanks for reading my book. ??

The Pew Research Center estimated in January 2018 that about 3.45 million Muslims of all ages were living in the U.S. in 2017, constituting about 1.1% of the total U.S. population. Pew also projected that by 2050  well more than the 20-year period posited by the meme  the U.S. Muslim population would reach 8.1 million, or 2.1% of the nations total population. estimated While 2.1% of the total population may constitute a significant voting bloc, obviously such a bloc would not be nearly large enough to determine the results of a nation-wide election all on its own. Even under the United States' electoral college system for electing presidents, which does not directly depend on popular vote totals, a candidate would still require the support of at least 23 percent of voters to reach the White House. Even that modest figure is more than 10 times greater than the projected Muslim proportion of the U.S. population in 2050. electoral college Moreover, even the modest Muslim population is at a disadvantage when it comes to the electoral college system, as Muslims are not evenly distributed around the U.S. According to Pew, some metropolitan areas such as Washington, D.C., have sizable Muslim communities, and \"certain states, such as New Jersey, are home to two or three times as many Muslim adults per capita as the national average.\" But other states are home to far fewer Muslims. Regardless, without radical changes in immigration laws and patterns (or fecundity), it's simply not plausible that \"in twenty years there will be enough Muslim voters in the U.S. to elect the President.\" Even if such a huge shift in the religious make-up of the U.S. population were possible in such a relatively short timeframe, it's unclear what readers could or should do in response to the meme's exhortation for them \"to make a difference.\" Repeal the First Amendment's religious liberty protections in order to bar Muslims from voting? Encourage non-Muslim women to engage in a \"baby race\" to out-populate Muslims? Pass legislation against demographics? For those truly curious about Muslim voting patterns in the U.S., we note the Pew Research Center reported in November 2018 that, \"Many more U.S. Muslims identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party than the GOP (66 % vs. 13 %), but the share who are Republican has held steady over the last 10 years, including after the election of President Donald Trump ...\" So Muslim voters could conceivably tip an election in favor of a particular major-party candidate in conjunction with that party's base of voters, but they will not be sufficiently numerous to elect a candidate on their own any time in the next few decades. voting patterns https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/03/new-estimates-show-u-s-muslim-population-continues-to-grow/ https://www.npr.org/2016/11/02/500112248/how-to-win-the-presidency-with-27-percent-of-the-popular-vote https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/06/republicans-account-for-a-small-but-steady-share-of-u-s-muslims/ Mohamed, Besheer.  \"Republicans Account for a Small But Steady Share of U.S. Muslims.\"\r\n  Pew Research Center.  6 November 2018.

TRUE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, November 2011] \nSome kids placed strong firecracker in the mouth of this animal and made sure he could not open it. The world is like this. To these kids it must have been a macabre fun for a few minutes and then they continued with their life like nothing happened. To this animal, his life ended during those minutes, with a pain so deep that is better to forget. If you are against the mistreatment of animals, share this so that more people see what we are capable to do and how inhumane we could be. Friends, I'm really sorry if this picture hurts you, I got hurt while posting too. I'm sharing this because of that I hope if some one near you tries to do these kind of things, you will at least try to tell them that this is really a harsh. Will you?  *Share* if you are against mistreatment of animals \n\n    Origins:   The misuse of fireworks poses a danger both to those who misuse them and to innocent bystanders, and the category of \"innocent bystanders\" is not limited to human beings.  Explosive fireworks, particularly, can pose a real danger to dogs who don't understand their hazardous nature and may try to play with or pick up fireworks with burning fuses, resulting in ghastly injuries when those fireworks go off.   (A 2010 article provides an account of a dog that had to be euthanized after being injured in such a manner.) article Appallingly, such tragedies are not limited to the realm of the accidental, as plenty of examples can be found of miscreants' taking perverse delight in inserting explosives into various orifices of live animals.  Such is the claim associated with the photograph displayed above, which is said to depict a dog injured by kids' forcibly placing fireworks into its mouth, and which, sadly, appears to be true. The picture corresponds to a series of photos posted on Facebook in mid-November 2011 which are listed as being taken in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and depict a mutilated German Shepherd identified as Vucko, and it's also similar to a series of photos published in mid-November 2011 on a Bosnian web site that described them with the following (roughly translated) statement: photos published \n\nHuman cruelty to animals, unfortunately, day by day is getting worse, and cruelty was once again demonstrated on Friday in the Sarajevo suburb of Ilidza where unknown perpetrators put fireworks in the mouth of a dog, who suffered very serious injuries for which he was allegedly put to sleep by veterinarians.\n\n The social action network care2 also reported the following backstory about Vucko: reported \n\nTwo drunken teenagers in Bosnia decided to have \"fun\" by duct-taping a firework in a German Shepherd's mouth and blowing off his face. Having done this, they took off, leaving the helpless creature to suffer.  The poor dog, known as Vucko, apparently wandered in agony for five days, unable to eat. Finally, he was picked up by authorities and taken to a vetenarian's office, but had to be euthanized after vets were unable to perform reconstructive surgery.\n\n Vucko's case prompted the creation of a petition seeking the passage of animal cruelty legislation in Bosnia.  petition \n\n\n\n  Last updated:  25 July 2015\n ",

The company originally said in its terms of privacy, \"You will allow us to use, edit your content with our service permanently, no limit and no recover.\" KFVS-TV also says, in some cases, content can contain viruses that can damage your computer, use your Facebook profile in ways you might not know, or even attempt to steal your credit card or bank account numbers.

Many articles cited extantBetter Business Bureau warnings about rogue apps that antedated \"Be Like Bill\" and referenced \"clickbait,\" but the term was applied exceptionally broadly and not specifically to malware.

Blobla's On 27 January 2016, Chicago station WMAQ published an article which reported that the Better Business Bureau (BBB) didn't suggest \"Be Like Bill\" posed any specific threat at all to social media users and added that the President and CEO of the Better Business Bureau of Chicago and Northern Illinois Steve Bernas had confirmed only that the BBB was looking into the meme (and keeping an eye out for impostors). article According to the outlet, Blobla clarified that the generator didn't require Facebook authorizations of the sort generally associated with malware or rogue apps: However, the Better Business Bureau has not yet definitely ruled whether the generated memes pose a risk to you or your computer. The sensation's creator, Bloba, on the other hand says they don't collect any data from users and their terms are the same as any others you see on Facebook. \"First, our game Be Like Bill doesn't require users to authorize a Facebook app,\" a spokesperson for Bloba wrote in response. \"Of course if users want to share the results to Facebook, they must be logged in Facebook. However we use Facebook share dialog for users to share their results. It's a very common ... This doesn't allow us to collect any data from user's Facebook account.\" Blobla's creators also explained that the now-elided, widely-cited verbiage (\"permanently, no limit and no recover\") was poorly composed and pertained to unrelated functions which might have ended up on their web site: \"Second, we do not store any information of users on our servers, as stated in our ToS,\" Bloba continued. \"Third, the Terms about our right to users' content is about posts on our website (a post may be a game like Be Like Bill, or a quiz, a video...). Because our website has a function for normal users to create a post in other languages. We have removed that term to avoid misunderstanding.\" On 29 January 2016, BBB communications director Katherine Hutt clarified the bureau's stance on \"Be Like Bill,\" due to themultiple news reports conflating their earlier \"clickbait\" warnings withthat particularmeme and generator: We don't issue warnings about a specific company without investigating first. Finally, outlets devoted to more detailed reporting on online security (such as Sophos' Naked Security blog) haven't issued any warnings about \"Be Like Bill\" or the popular comic generator. No widespread reports of adverse outcomes have substantiated news affiliate speculation, and the bulk of \"Be Like Bill\"-themed reports focused on the general ability for malware to spread through apps, not any reports definitively (or anecdotally) related to that meme specifically.

        "justification": "The New Testament's book of Colossians (one of the thirteen epistles traditionally attributed to Paul, this one addressed to Christians in the city Colossae) reads as follows (in verses 1:12-20 of the King James Version): Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell; And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. It is not uncommon for sermons and other Christian devotional/inspirational writings to cite this passage in comparison with some scientific concept: Just as gravity or atoms or molecules are the \"glue\" that holds the physical world together, so God or Jesus is the force that binds the spiritual world. An example involving laminin glycoprotein cited is one example of this form, with the addition of a graphic meant to illustrate how God's design is evident (in the shape of a cross) in the molecular structure of laminin  what literally holds us together (in a biological sense) was clearly created by He who spiritually holds us together: laminin A couple of days ago I was running (I use that term very loosely) on my treadmill, watching a DVD sermon by Louie Giglio ... and I was BLOWN AWAY! I want to share what I learned ... but I fear not being able to convey it as well as I want. I will share anyway. He (Louie) was talking about how inconceivably BIG our God is ... how He spoke the universe into being ... how He breathes stars out of His mouth that are huge raging balls of fire ... etc. etc. Then He went on to speak of how this star-breathing, universe creating God ALSO knitted our human bodies together with amazing detail and wonder. At this point I am LOVING it (fascinating from a medical standpoint, you know.) ... and I was remembering how I was constantly amazed during medical school as I learned more and more about God's handiwork. I remember so many times thinking ... \"How can ANYONE deny that a Creator did all of this???\" Louie went on to talk about how we can trust that the God who created all this, also has the power to hold it all together when things seem to be falling apart ... how our loving Creator is also our sustainer. And then I lost my breath. And it wasn't because I was running my treadmill, either!!! It was because he started talking about laminin. I knew about laminin. Here is how wikipedia describes them: \"Laminins are a family of proteins that are an integral part of the structural scaffolding of basement membranes in almost every animal tissue.\" You see ... laminins are what hold us together ... LITERALLY. They are cell adhesion molecules. They are what holds one cell of our bodies to the next cell. Without them, we would literally fall apart. And I knew all this already. But what I didn't know is what laminin LOOKED LIKE. But now I do. And I have thought about it a thousand times since (already) ... Here is what the structure of laminin looks like ... AND THIS IS NOT a \"Christian portrayal\" of it ... if you look up laminin in any scientific/medical piece of literature, this is what you will see ... Now tell me that our God is not the coolest!!! Amazing! The 'glue' that holds us together ... ALL of us ... is in the shape of the cross. Immediately Colossians 1:15-17 comes to mind. \"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by him all things were created; things in heaven and on earth , visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things HOLD TOGETHER.\" Colossians 1:15-17 Call me crazy. I just think that is very, very, very cool. Thousands of years before the world knew anything about laminin, Paul penned those words. And now we see that from a very LITERAL standpoint, we are held together...one cell to another....by the cross. You would never in a quadrillion years convince me that is anything other than the mark of a Creator who knew EXACTLY what laminin \"glue\" would look like long before Adam even breathed his first breath!!\nWe praise YOU, Lord!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This particular example is based on the work of Christian pastor/evangelist Louie Giglio, as seen in the following video clip:  Discussions about whether or not nature evinces signs of a purposeful (Christian) creator are theological/scientific debates that can (and do) fill volumes, so we'll just note a few items to consider: accidentally crucifixion And when the illustration is returned to its original orientation, many liken it to the appearance of a sword:  appearances  Davis, Kenneth C.

Send them into us so we can share them.\n\n   The photo was originally posted to the Heart of Vancouver Island Facebook page on 1 April 2015. Yes, the above-displayed image is an April Fool's Day joke, but since many viewers have encountered this image on social media sites such as Twitter and Imgur on days other than April 1, a number of them have pondered it seriously and questioned its authenticity.  Facebook joke Twitter Imgur Although salt water is the natural habitat for orcas, these creatures have occassionaly been found in freshwater streams. In 2011, two killer whales were found dead after wandering too far up a river in Alaska: dead \nTwo of three killer whales that wandered far up an Alaska river have died, apparently succumbing to stresses associated with being out of their saltwater habitat, federal officials said on Sunday. Fresh water has a different chemical makeup than saltwater and prolonged exposure is dangerous for killer whales, said Julie Speegle, a NOAA spokeswoman in Juneau, Alaska. \"Saltwater is their natural habitat,\" she said. \"They do often swim into fresh water pursuing prey, but usually they turn around and go back into the saltwater.\"\n \n\n\n\n  Last updated:  24 April 2015\n ",

According to Lisa, Devon skipped his last class after lunch at  Horseheads High School [on April 17] and hasn't been heard from since. Lisa says her husband checked the local hospital and notified both village police and New York State Troopers of their son's disappearance.  Devon is said to be about 5 foot 7 and most likely wearing a black jacket. When I asked Lisa whether she believed there were a chance that her son had decided to simply run away, she said her son isn't the type of kid to just run away, but that she was told he might be headed to Pennsylvania. I spoke the the Chemung County Sheriff's Office who confirmed that this is an active case. They referred me to Horseheads Police Department where I was told Devon's case is a State Police case.  I spoke with Trooper Lewis at the State Police office who didn't divulge any information but confirmed that Devon has been reported missing and that State Troopers are on the case. If you've seen Devon Ward or know where he is, please contact the New York State Troopers at 607-739-8797.\n On the evening of 18 April 2013, Devon's mother indicated on her Facebook page  that Devon had been located safe: Facebook \nWe found Devon. He is safe and sound at the police barracks in Horseheads. Thank you to everyone who helped spread the word. We greatly appreciate all the help and support. We have such a wonderful community!! Please share the status, so that people know he's been found.\n Taylor, Traci.  \"14 Year Old Missing from Horseheads, May Be Headed to Pennsylvania.\"\r\n  WHWK Radio  18 April 2013.",

However, as is customary at the Insider's Table, we wanted to share the news with you first!  What's all the excitement about?  On Wednesday, July 30, Cheesecake Factory restaurants nationwide will offer every delicious slice of our more than 30 varieties of cheesecake for $1.50 per slice  just like we did when we opened our first restaurant back in 1978!

Your friends at The Insider's Table\n Origins:  The  Cheesecake Factory chain of restaurants began with a small cheesecake shop opened in Detroit in the late 1940s by Oscar and Evelyn Overton.  Although the Overtons eventually gave up that shop in order to raise their children (with Evelyn continuing to supply local restaurants with cheesecakes she baked in her basement kitchen), they moved to California in 1971 and opened a \"Cheesecake Factory\" bakery in Los Angeles.  The Overtons' bakery business grew over the next several years to the point that they were distributing a variety of cheesecakes and other desserts to hundreds of accounts, and in 1978 their son David opened the first \"Cheesecake Factory\" restaurant in Beverly Hills.  From that initial bakery and restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory chain has grown to 143 locations in 34 states coast to coast (including Hawaii and the District of Columbia).

In addition, a special, limited edition cheesecake, the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, will be introduced on July 30th with $0.25 from the sale of each slice sold this year benefiting the national hunger-relief organization, America's Second Harvest  The Nation's Food Bank Network.\n Additional information:  \n\n   The Cheesecake Factory Serves Up a Delicious 30th Anniversary Celebration  Last updated:  23 July 2008\n  \n",

Twitter tweet Tyson Facebook post  This post truly did come from Tyson's official, and verified, Facebook page. For that reason, we rated this claim \"Correct Attribution.\" While we were looking around for evidence of the Tyson quote, we noticed a user in a Facebook group named \"Snowflake Central\" shared the above-mentioned meme, generating hundreds of additional views of it.  Snowflake Central shared This Facebook group, with its more than 30,000 members, deserved a closer examination because it included characteristics that are often indicative of foreign-run social media accounts that spread propaganda and disinformation to a U.S. audience.  Firstly, this Facebook group claimed that it was based in California City, California. While California City is a real city with around 14,000 residents, we have found in several past investigations that many politically-oriented Facebook accounts, pages, or groups that showed the town as their location were actually managed by foreign users pretending to be Americans. 14,000 residents several past investigations  Why California City? It's plausible to suppose that foreign propagandists and disinformation purveyors mistakenly typed the state name in the city field when filling out the various questions to set up accounts, pages, and groups on Facebook. The first city to auto-populate when typing \"California\" into the city field on Facebook is California City. Another indication of the \"Snowflake Central\" group's suspicious origins: its administrators. Four administrators were publicly displayed on the page, and one of those accounts had a duplicate account and claimed to be the \"CEO at eBay\" (and it wasn't Jamie Iannone, the e-commerce site's real CEO). Meanwhile, another a Facebook page, not a profile, for a political organization named \"Criminal Illegal Aliens - CIA Report\" was listed as another administrator for the \"Snowflake Central\" group. Jamie Iannone Criminal Illegal Aliens - CIA Report We will continue to monitor this Facebook group's future activities. In sum, aside from the separate issue of the suspect Facebook group, Tyson truly did once endorse the idea that, \"Social media made y'all way too comfortable with disrespecting people and not getting punched in the face for it.\" California City, California.

The letter was shared on SAG-AFTRAs website, along with the union's response to Trump, which was a simple, Thank you. website response As seen in the document, the end of the letter is indeed signed with President Donald J. Trump.   In the letter, Trump cited his own acting experience and contributions to television: Im very proud of my work on movies such as Home Alone 2, Zoolander and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps; and television shows including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Saturday Night Live, and of course, one of the most successful shows in television history, The Apprentice  to name just a few! Ive also greatly helped the cable news television business (said to be a dying platform with not much time left until I got involved in politics), and created thousands of jobs at networks such as MSDNC and Fake News CNN, among many others. He concluded with a criticism of the unions actions: Your organization has done little for its members, and nothing for me  besides collecting dues and promoting dangerous un-American policies and ideas  as evident by your massive unemployment rates and lawsuits from celebrated actors, who even recorded a video asking, Why isnt the union fighting for me? These, however, are policy failures. Your disciplinary failures are even more egregious. I no longer wish to be associated with your union. Professor and author Seth Abramson pointed out how signing the letter this way is troubling, given that Trump is on trial for inciting the riots:  However, signing a letter as President does not appear to be out of the ordinary. Former President Barack Obama's statements are also released under \"President Obama.\" Former presidents are still addressed as President [insert name] or Mr. President.

In telephone interviews with Snopes.com, both of those individuals confirmed their accounting of the details in the Daily Beast's report: four adults (three mothers and one older sister) asserted that government social workers had told them they'd have to fork over $700 to $800 for DNA tests proving their relationship to separated children before they could get their kids back. story DNA tests Shortly after the story broke, however, both Garcia and Holguin reported to us that the government had abruptly changed course, with the former telling us: \nIf you ask me the question, 'Do you know for a fact that any of those parent had to pay the money [for a DNA test]?' I do not. We had about five people who at that point said they were told they would probably have to pay for [the DNA tests]. Since that story came out, the whole scenery has changed because [the government] has now moved aggressively to reunite and release all of these kids.\n Holguin told us no formal request was ever made for the women to pay for the tests. She described the entirety of \"zero tolerance\" and its aftermath as \"very chaotic\" and said that conflicting information had been the norm throughout. \"With the DNA test, I think someone at one point said it, someone repeated it  things were changing so quickly that it was just impossible to know at any given at any moment. The left hand didnt know what the right hand was doing.\" We reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the federal agency tasked with coordinating the care of unaccompanied immigrant children. An agency representative told us HHS, not immigrant families, pays for DNA testing. The federal government is rushing to meet a deadline set by a federal judge after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) successfully sued for an injunction on family separations under \"zero tolerance,\" a policy initiated by the Trump administration in April 2018. Judge Dana Sabraw of the Southern District of California gave federal agencies until 10 July 2018 to reunify children under five years of age with their respective adults, and until 26 July 2018 to reunify kids five through 17 years old. deadline policy According to a status report submitted to the court by HHS on 13 July 2018, not all families with children in the older age cohort will be subjected to DNA tests, as HHS has truncated its process for confirming family relationships to meet the looming deadline for reunification. In a statement, HHS spokesperson Evelyn Stauffer said: The department has been operating in good faith and earnestly trying to comply with court orders, including the rapidly approaching deadline for reunification. Our interpretation of the court's order is that HHS must make a determination of parentage, fitness, and safety before reunifying families, but that HHS need not undertake the fuller process of vetting for children's safety that HHS would ordinarily conduct in its operations. In the interests of transparency and cooperation, the department felt it necessary in our filings on Friday to share with the court our view that meeting the deadline would mean truncating the process we might have otherwise followed. Within the time the court allows, we will strive to implement the most comprehensive procedures possible to ensure child welfare. We look forward to continuing our close work with the court to accomplish the goals we share of safe, expeditious reunification. Under \"zero tolerance,\" all immigrants caught crossing the southern border between ports of entry were charged with crimes  mostly misdemeanors. Adults accompanied by children were separated from them and, initially, the U.S. government appeared to have no plan to reunify families. no plan With court orders and pressure mounted by public outrage over the policy, the Trump administration has more or less reversed course. Garcia told us the federal government would begin reuniting the remainder of separated families at centralized locations in Arizona and Texas in the coming week in order to meet the court's 26 July 2018 deadline. Judge Sabraw also temporarily halted deportations of those families to give them time to decide whether to leave children behind in the United States in hopes they will win their asylum cases, or to be deported together. outrage Glawe, Justin, and Adam Rawnsley.  \"Government Told Immigrant Parents to Pay for DNA Tests to Get Kids Back, Advocate Says.\"\r\n  The Daily Beast.  10 July 2018.

As news outlets quickly fielded reports about the terrorist leader's death, the Washington Post published an obituary that labeled al-Baghdadi an \"austere religious scholar.\" Screenshots of this obituary headline were widely shared on social media along with criticism of the news outlet. Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, for instance, posted the following message on Twitter: Stop, read this & think about it: last night a ruthless, brutal terrorist who threatened our country & is responsible for the death of American citizens was killed in a successful operation by US military & @washingtonpost described #Albagdadi as an austere religious scholar pic.twitter.com/Mjptm0Fa3Z @washingtonpost #Albagdadi pic.twitter.com/Mjptm0Fa3Z  Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) October 27, 2019 October 27, 2019  This is a genuine headline that briefly appeared on Washingtonpost.com.

Kristine Coratti Kelly (@kriscoratti) October 27, 2019 October 27, 2019  The qualms over the Washington Post's headline likely served as the inspiration of a meme targeting another \"mainstream media\" outlet, CNN.

        "justification": "Snopes is still fighting an infodemic of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we've learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and advice you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. \n fighting Find out Read Submit Become a Founding Member CDC WHO In July 2020, social media users posted a meme that included a screenshot of an article excerpt that allegedly demonstrated hydroxychloroquine would be an effective \"cure and vaccine\" against COVID-19.  The claim stems from an opinion piece by Bryan Fischer, former director of the American Family Association, that interpreted a 2005 study on the utility of chloroquine to treat SARS as being relevant to COVID-19  a disease that did not exist at the time of that paper's publication. SARS (aka SARS-CoV, which caused epidemics in the early 2000s) and COVID-19 (aka SARS-CoV-2) are both caused by coronaviruses, but that does not mean that both could be treated with the same medication.  Similarly, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are related drugs, but that does not mean they are interchangeable. Finally, the excerpted study was limited in scope and based on laboratory results. Fischer attempted to tie Dr. Anthony Fauci to the 2005 study by falsely alleging that it was published in a journal run by the U.S. agency Fauci heads.   Are SARS and COVID-19 the same? No. While SARS and COVID-19 are both coronaviruses, that does not mean these two diseases are interchangeable, nor that they can be treated with identical medicines. Hundreds of coronaviruses exist, most of which circulate among animals. These viruses occasionally jump to humans and cause diseases that range in severity. The common cold, for instance, which isn't particularly known for being lethal, can be caused by a coronavirus. On the other hand, COVID-19, which has caused more than 150,000 deaths in the United States (and close to 700,000 total deaths worldwide) as of this writing, is also caused by a coronavirus. Nobody would argue that a treatment for the common cold would be equally effective against COVID-19.  Hundreds of coronaviruses exist Fischer attempts to dismiss the fact that SARS and COVID-19 are two distinct diseases by arguing that they share a similar scientific name (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2) and 79% of the same genome. Saying that these two diseases share 79% of their genome sequence may make it sound like these diseases are nearly identical, but consider this: Humans share 98% of our genome with chimpanzees.  98% of our genome Are hydroxycloroquine and chloroquine the same thing? No. Although these drugs are similar (they are both derivatives of a 4-aminoquinoline [4AQ] nucleus), they aren't interchangeable. Chloroquine is primarily used to treat malaria, while hydroxychloroquine, which is considered less toxic than chloroquine, is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and certain blood disorders.  CNN writes: writes Chloroquine is used to treat malaria, as well as in chemoprophylaxis, which is the administering of drugs to prevent the development of disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2006, it has not been recommended for use in severe malaria because of problems with resistance, particularly in the Oceania region, according to the World Health Organization. [...] Hydroxychloroquine is what's known as an analog of chloroquine, meaning the two have similar structures but different chemical and biological properties. The former is considered the less toxic derivative, according to studies.\nIt's given to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and the blood disorder porphyria cutanea tarda, the CDC said. Did this study prove that chloroquine was an effective treatment against SARS? No. The 2005 article published in Virology Journal was based on a laboratory cell-culture experiment that used primate cells, not human cells. The authors noted at the time that more testing was needed before antivirals could be developed to treat the disease in humans: Virology Journal Chloroquine has been widely used to treat human diseases, such as malaria, amoebiosis, HIV, and autoimmune diseases, without significant detrimental side effects [15]. Together with data presented here, showing virus inhibition in cell culture by chloroquine doses compatible with patient treatment, these features suggest that further evaluation of chloroquine in animal models of SARS-CoV infection would be warranted as we progress toward finding effective antivirals for prevention or treatment of the disease. It should also be noted that this was an in vitro study, meaning that it was conducted in a controlled environment, like a test tube, not inside a living organism. The Universal Health Network, a medical research organization in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, noted that in vitro models have a reputation of being \"less translatable\" to humans than other research methods: Universal Health Network A major drawback is their failure to capture the inherent complexity of organ systems. For example, in vitro models may not account for interactions between cells and biochemical processes that occur during turnover and metabolism. As a result, in vitro studies have developed a reputation for being less translatable to humans. More importantly, in the years since the SARS outbreak in 2002, chloroquine has not been widely used to treat the disease.  Did this study say that hydroxychloroquine was an effective treatment against SARS? No.  The 2005 paper in the Virology Journal never mentions hydroxychloroquine. Was Fauci or the NIH involved in this 2005 paper? No.  As mentioned earlier, the above-displayed screenshot shows an excerpt from an opinion piece written by Fischer, which was published on websites such as One News Now and the conspiratorial True Pundit, a site that traffics in misinformation.  One News Now True Pundit, misinformation Fischer's article is centered on a 2005 paper published in the Virology Journal entitled \"Chloroquine Is a Potent Inhibitor of SARS Coronavirus Infection and Spread.\" Although this is a genuine article, it was not authored by Fauci. Fischer attempted to connect Fauci to this article by stating that the \"Virology Journal [is] the official publication of Dr. Faucis National Institutes of Health [NIH],\" but that simply isn't true. The Virology Journal is not an official publication of the NIH.  Virology Journal The Virology Journal is published by Biomed Central (BMC), part of the publishing group Springer Nature, an academic publishing company.

FALSE Example:   [Collected via e-mail and YouTube, June 2015] A husband remodeled the kitchen while she was on vacation. He spent 60k but she thinks it is stupid.  Origins: In June 2015, a video originally uploaded to YouTube on 20 February 2012 by user DIRTYDAG and titled \"kitchen makeover fail\" began recirculating on social media sites such Facebook and Reddit. The video (embedded above) initially bore the following description when it was first posted: Reddit after building what i thought was my wifes dream kitchen i found that she really didnt want it at all! she was on vacation for a week while i completely built this kitchen!60 thousand dollars later and she hates it! By June 2015, the video had accumulated more than three million views on YouTube alone (and likely amassed a number of others through social media copies and reposts). Commenters excoriated the woman seen castigating her husband in the video: Divorce her now.  She will kill you.  Most likely from the heartache of disappointment in never meeting her standard false standards.  This need to be shared and put up on the news or something.\n  60k on a kitchen for her? I was expecting Kate Upton to come walking through the door, not this water buffalo.\n  I'd like to share this video but the title would give the wrong impression. Should be titled \"ungrateful bitch wife hates kitchen remodel\" Some viewers questioned the clip's authenticity, and it turned out that not much investigation was required to determine whether the reaction depicted was indeed genuine. Directly under the description (and reiterated in several comments), its uploader explained that it was a planned prank that had sat in relative obscurity until the clip was mined by a television show: People people people! This video is a prank we made 3 years ago at a vacation rental! This video sat dormant for 2 1/2 years before True TV aired it on on of their shows last fall! Until 3 days ago it was at 8000 views for that 3 years it's been in existence! Now all of a sudden it goes viral and we are bad people? Give me a break! For those of you who get what we did here, I applaud you! For those who just don't get it...I don't think you would even if explained to you!. If you ever get a chance to come to Cedar Point or Ohio, Look into this house called Rock Of Ages! It is a beautiful historic home on the shores of Lake Erie. 13 bedrooms and 11 baths, it has room for a big group! The kitchen was built to entertain! That's why you see 2 of everything. My wife actually does love the kitchen and wishes we could afford 1 of everything let alone 2 of everything! Enjoy the video for what it was for! Entertainment! Nothing more, nothing less! Don't get all bent out of shape over silly shit! Life's to short for that! Have a good day! The \"kitchen makeover fail\" cyclically circulates on social media, although its creators long ago admitted that the video was staged and the woman seen in it was playing along with the joke.  The short video was created for the amusement of a small audience and been all but forgotten by the time it went viral (more than two years after it was published). ",

Detaining them for $252 each, per day, will cost taxpayers $453.6 million per month this year and could cost $982.8 million per month next year.\nThe image and events around it were widely reported for several months, appearing in the Houston Chronicle, Splinter News, the Los Angeles Times, Mashable, and Reuters, among others.\nStories during that time specifically reiterated that the photographs showed unaccompanied minor children in the custody of United States Customs and Border Protection and temporarily housed at a Texas Air Force base:\nThe photos have a timestamp of May 27, 2014.\nA spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the agency has not officially released any photos at this time in order to protect the rights and privacy of unaccompanied minors in our care.\n... A temporary shelter at Joint Base San Antonio Lackland has housed and provided services to 1,820 unaccompanied minors from Central America since May 18, San Antonio Express-News reporter Melissa Fletcher Stoeltje reported. The immigration is part of a surge of children said to be fleeing poverty and violence in their home countries, she reported.\nAlthough the photograph is real, it does not show children separated from their parents by the Obama administration. In June 2014, the image was published as part of numerous news stories (and occasionally alongside editorial pieces objecting to the presence of the unaccompanied minor children.) The image did not develop a different backstory until June 2018, during a controversy that specifically involved family separation at the behest of the Trump administration.\n",

If you use a pressure canner be sure the weights/release is working correctly. Despite clear interest in the events of the photograph (and multiple reposts of the picture), the actual scenario depicted by the photograph remains unknown. We were unable to find any online versions of it before it was shared to Imgur in August 2015 Imgur While it's possible the photograph indeed depicts a pressure canning or cooking scenario gone awry, no actual information was ever included alongside its iterations to definitively describe the image. We don't know when the photo was taken, by whom, or even in which country the purported kitchen catastrophe occurred. Moreover, canning enthusiasts commenting on the image noted that while debris from equipment was scattered throughout the scene in the photograph, the splattered food one would expect to see if a pressure cooker malfunctioned was curiously absent. It's unlikely that either the person who originally posted the photograph on Imgur or the Reddit reposter snapped the picture themselves. As such, any information gleaned from such online postings are speculative, and the humorous one-line descriptions that have accompanied it were likely invented to encourage sharing of an amusing picture.

            "Were Osco drug stores changed back to the Sav-On name because 'asco' means 'disgust' in Spanish?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Southern California Sav-On drug store outlets were renamed Osco after an acquisition, then reverted to the original Sav-On name when their parent company discovered \"asco\" means \"disgust\" or \"loathing\" in Spanish. FALSE Origins:  In 1980, Anaheim-based Sav-On drugs, the leading drug store chain in southern California, was bought by Jewel Cos., a large food and drugstore company.  In 1984, American Stores  the parent company of Chicago-based Osco, a large drug store chain concentrated in the Midwestern and Eastern U.S.  acquired Sav-On when it purchased Jewel.   The Sav-On stores were incorporated into the Osco chain starting in 1986 and designated \"Osco / Sav-On,\" eventually dropping the \"Sav-On\" portion of its  Sav-On name. Then the unexpected occurred.  Sales were lower than anticipated at Sav-On stores in southern California and Las Vegas, and they began losing market share to competing drug chains.  Within three years Osco announced that their 165 outlets in those areas would revert to using the original \"Sav-On Drugs\" name. What happened?  Word around Los Angeles was that those Osco folks from the Midwest hadn't considered a factor of paramount importance in the heavily Hispanic southern California market: The name Osco has the same pronunciation as the Spanish word \"asco\" (oss-ko), which means \"disgust\" or \"loathing.\" Of course Osco's market share declined in California, know-it-all L.A. wags suggested, because how many Spanish-speaking people would want to purchase drugs and beauty aids from a store whose very name indicates repulsion?  This, they claimed, was obviously the reason Osco changed the stores' names back to Sav-On. Osco's vice-president of administration, Alan Barker, maintained otherwise: \n\nThere is no connection between that and the name change.  I told that to another reporter, and it showed\nup as a \"no comment.\"  I said this was a very exciting, very, very positive change for the company, and none of that showed up either. We are changing it back because customers recognize Sav-On from decades of operation. We're going to respond to what our customers recognize.  The L.A. Times suggested there was a connection there, and it is nonsense. I don't know where people come up with that garbage.\n Was the unfortunate cross-language meaning the real reason for the name change?  Probably not.  Most likely it was another flavor of the infamous Chevrolet Nova legend, as others pointed out: Nova \n\nIt's just an amusing story, said Hector Marquez, professor of Spanish at the University of Redlands. He compared it to stories several years ago about the Chevrolet Nova.  \"No va'' in Spanish can mean \"it doesn't go,'' but Marquez said any Spanish-speaking person would know better.  \"People who study sales and advertising might have a different view,'' Marquez said.  \"But from a language point of view, this sort of thing doesn't have an impact. I don't give much credibility to those stories.''\n The underlying cause for the sales slump in the California and Las Vegas markets was probably attributable to a number of factors, but one of those factors was almost certainly a common business blunder: When you have a name that consumers know and trust, don't change it.

In December 2018, a number of social media users came across a post promising a chance at an ambassadorship with the popular brand Lululemon. The posting, which was shared by Instagram accounts such as @lulurecruitment.co (which has no affiliation with the real Lululemon) explained that anyone with 150 followers had a chance of obtaining free clothes and gift for simply sharing this advertisement with their friends on social media: @lulurecruitment.co   This is not a genuine offer from Lululemon, and the accounts sharing this message are not affiliated with the brand. Lululemon's social media team has responded to a few queries about the scam with messages similar to the following: responded FB User: Is this legit? I am assuming no Lululemon: Hi Michelle, You've got itour accounts are verified with the blue check mark, and our ambassadors are chosen individually by our stores rather than via our social channels. This account has been flagged to our brand protection team. Let me know if you have more questions!\n - Camilla The non-existent ambassadorship was only offered to users with a minimum of 150 followers, which is a relatively low bar for any sort of social media position, especially for a well-known national brand such as Lululemon. This scam also required potential \"ambassadors\" to follow the fake Lululemon account and then share its post with their friends. This allowed the scammers to build a following and ensured that their dishonest message would be spread to a greater number of social media users. This Lululemon scam followed a strategy similar to other \"like farming\" social media schemes. Such fraudsters offer something of value (in this case an ambassadorship) in exchange for social media engagement, which allows them to quickly build a following and then provides them the opportunity to sell the account to a third party. like farming One way to avoid this type of scam is to double-check to make sure that a company-affiliated post actually originated with the brand's official social media accounts: @lululemon can you confirm if this is real or fake? pic.twitter.com/gnp8g2sD2p @lululemon pic.twitter.com/gnp8g2sD2p  Jason Davis (@Jasonnn93) December 13, 2018 December 13, 2018  Social media users should also keep old adages such as \"nothing in life is free\" when they peruse the internet.",

I want to warn everyone, I sell my works ONLY in the store on Etsy - a link in the profile, or in the instagram. All other stores and stuff are SCAMMERS!!! Please be careful. Do not be fooled. Yastrezhembovskya talked to MyModernMet.com about her work in 2019. The Russian artist said that she primarily works in felt and that these figurines typically take 12-14 hours to make: MyModernMet.com Yastrezhembovskya said: My first toy wasnt nearly as pretty, it was rather funny but I enjoyed the process so much that I kept trying. I was felting during my free time, even at night, and I got better with each toy I made ... I am flattered that my bats won the hearts of so many people, but the amount of orders I got was terrifying ... Of course, I will keep felting as many bats as I can, but I want people to understand that these toys are fully handmade, so its a fairly lengthy process.

Some websites claim that the soap keeps away mice, while others say it keeps away deer. One of the most popular assertions, however, is that Irish Spring Soap can be used to repel flies.  bars of soap One viral Facebook post shared by Tabe Paxon in July 2020 read: Has anyone else noticed how bad flies are this year? Well I googled how to keep them away and..... who knew Irish spring original scent would really work???? Im amazed lol. Easily amazed I guess. Dad and me sit on the back porch a lot and dad even had a fly swatted out here with him bc they where so bad. Hung one bar of Irish spring and shocked how quickly and well it works. Thought I would share for anyone else annoyed with the flies   The claim that Irish Spring soap repels flies has been amplified by a variety of home and gardening websites, such as grandmasthing.com, Homemaking.com, and even Buzzfeed. grandmasthing.com Homemaking.com Buzzfeed We're skeptical of this fly repellent solution for a few reasons. For starters, the sources we found pushing this claim don't provide much information as to why this works. Instead, the blogs offer vague and unsupported claims about how flies apparently don't like the smell. But that just doesn't pass the sniff test.  Second, if Colgate-Palmolive, the company that owns the Irish Spring brand, truly had their hands on an effective insect repellent, why wouldn't they market it as such? Why wouldn't they make a product specifically targeting this need? Lastly, we have not found any credible studies or experiments documenting whether hanging a bar of Irish Spring Soap effectively repelled flies. In fact, the only unofficial experiment found appeared to show the exact opposite. In June 2021, the Pine Meadows Hobby Farm, a frugal homestead in the Cascade Mountains that creates video tutorials for their YouTube page, posted a little experiment to see if Irish Spring Soap truly repelled flies. The results? The soap did not seem to have any impact on the pest problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bGa9jvK11s\n\nWe reached out to Colgate-Palmolive and the American Horticulture Society, and we will update this article if more information is made available.

        "justification": "FACT CHECK: Was a female shopper at a Tampa-area Target store targeted by child sex trafficking operatives?  Claim: A female shopper at a Tampa-area Target store was targeted by child sex trafficking operatives.  FALSE Examples: These pictures are circulating Facebook about a story of a sex trafficking ring in Tampa, and just wanted to find out if this was something that was true since moms everywhere are freaking out and causing slight hysteria! Thanks so much! Okay mommas, my best friend in Tampa just had a very scary thing happen to her at Target and the police told her this is happening more and more in stores like TargetI wanted you all to be aware of this. Her 5-year-old girl was targeted by a person working in sex trafficking. (warning-Im giving you all the details, so its long. But I think its valuable to know what to look for when we are out) She was in Target at 11am on Tuesday. The store wasnt busy and a girl around 10 years old approached her and her two kids in an aisle. (She had a 1 year old in the seat and her 5 year old was walking along beside her.) She said the little girl would come up and talk to Maddie (5 year old), but anytime Jenn (my friend) talked to her she would walk away. The 10 year old would approach them on another aisle with a toy and show Maddie, but again she would bolt if Jenn asked her a question. This happened for 45 minutes and she followed them through the whole store. The girl started getting angry (rolling her eyes and huffing) anytime Jenn talked to her. Jenn started feeling uneasy about the situation and went to checkout. When she went to the checkout the little girl stopped about 20 feet away and just watched her. Jenn told the cashier she was being followed and felt uneasy. The cashier told her to checkout and go straight to customer service and have someone walk her to the car. The whole time she was unloading her stuff she kept an eye on the girl. She sees the girl looking off to the left and Jenn turns and sees a man standing there. The little girl cocks her head towards Jenn and the kids, the man looks at them and shakes his head yes and the little girl turns and walks towards the back of the store. The man gets a pack of gum and comes right up behind Jenn and the kids. Jenn whispers to the cashier hes right behind me and the cashier shakes her head yes and tells her she saw what just happened. Jenn checkouts and walks to customer service. The man tells the cashier he forgot his wallet and puts the gum back and walks off. When Jenn goes to customer service instead of walking out the door, he picks up a magazine and looks through it. Jenn tells customer service what is happening and they call the manager. She turns around and the guy is staring at Maddienot taking his eyes off her. When the guy sees the manager coming he takes off running out the door. The manager runs after him and there is a car waiting outside and the guy jumps in and ANOTHER guy, who was in the parking lot walking around, runs and jumps in the car too. They shut down Target to try and find the little girl, but surveillance cameras show her exiting a back door and getting into the same car the guys jumped in. When the police got there they said this was a textbook case of child sex trafficking. They wait until you get out to your car and when you are unloading your stuff they grab the child who is standing next to you or walking around the car to get in their seat. Target is an easy storemostly moms with their kids and not too busy during a weekday. Thankfully Jenn did everything right and everyone is safe. Im sick to my stomach thinking of what might have happened. I felt the need to share this story with other mommas, especially ones with little girls. The police said the age the traffickers are looking for is 5-10 year old girlsmakes me so sick. Im not trying to unnecessarily scare anyone, but we definitely need to be aware of this evil and be on-guard when we are out with our kids.   Origins:  In August 2015, the above-quoted cautionary tale about a shopper's purported brush with sex trafficking rings at a Tampa-area Target store began circulating like wildfire on regional Facebook groups for \"mommies.\" (A popular text-based version was shared on 26 August 2015, and a post consisting of the same messages in screenshot form appeared the following day.) shared following The rumor about sex traffickers in an unspecified Tampa-area Target (of which there are several) was not an anomaly in mid-2015, as a constellation of nearly identical claims were shared by social media users that summer. In May 2015, a Facebook user relayed a harrowing (and unreliable) claim of kidnappers terrorizing an Oklahoma Hobby Lobby store; in June, Twitter became fixated upon sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews; later that same month the theme park abduction urban legend recirculated; subsequently, a frightening tale of purported teenaged assailants armed with sedating drugs in the bathroom of a Denton, Texas, Dillards department store circulated the same channels; finally, a Hickory, North Carolina Walmart shopper convinced herself and several Facebook users that human trafficking magnates were trawling the parking lots of the chain store for new victims. Hobby Lobby job interviews theme park Dillards Hickory The warning didn't specify either when the woman (whose name was given only as \"Jenn\") encountered the suspicious parties in Target or at which Target store the incident purportedly occurred, and incidents involving stranger danger of the type described (and to which police were said to have referred) did not appear in any news reports in or around the Tampa area in Florida. Also, unlike some of the previous popular sex trafficking rumors, the Tampa Target warning lacked even basic suggestions that fellow shoppers could reasonably employ to avoid meeting the suggested fate of the woman in the story (had she not taken note of being tailed around the store for an unusually long amount of time by a strange child).  \"Jenn\" offered no insights nor described any crime-fighting strategies by which those sharing the tale could impart anything other than nebulous fears about visiting Target. We contacted police in Tampa to verify whether a report about an incident like the one described had been received by them, ascertain which Target might have been the one referenced in the story, and to find out if any current bulletins warn of such activity in Tampa or surrounding areas. A public information officer responded to us by stating that \"a Target store shutting down because of the situation described below would be something newsworthy\" but that the department had \"no information [and had not] heard that this has happened in a Tampa Target.\" On 27 August 2015, several Facebook users published the story the Tampa Police Department's Facebook page. In response, the department said: said We've received several calls on this asking if it is accurate and we have no reports of anything like this in Tampa.  A person commenting on the post noted that the tale had already been adapted to appeal to social media users in other states: I saw several of those posts yesterday and today as well. First I saw that it was in Tampa and then I saw the exact same post but in New York.. On 28 August 2015 a Facebook user who published one of the most popular iterations of the Tampa Target claim stated in a separate post that \"[a]fter some investigation the story is false,\" but that user did not share how she came to believe the claim was fabricated. And while signs point to a classic (and unsubstantiated) urban legend with respect to the Tampa Target story, it's even less likely an occurred simultaneously at a location of the same exact store (not KMart or Walmart, but Target) several states away. iterations post Last updated: 31 August 2015 Originally published: 27 August 2015",

She just killed this male leopard in his prime. According to SCI (Safari Club International) this leopard ranks as potentially the 9th largest leopard ever hunted. She's a cretin.

On 7 September, SCI posted more details about \"Brittany L.'s\" leopard photograph on HuntForever.org, a website affiliated with the organization. That blog post has since been removed, but we obtained an SCI newsletter email dated 7 September with content identical to the blog post's embedded in it (despite the post's having been removed from HuntForever.org itself). affiliated That blog post described the contentious photograph as follows: \"Brittany L. is featured here with her African leopard that potentially ranks number 9 overall and scores 18 4/16.\" described Safari Club International.  \"SCI Members Share Their Hunter Pride.\"\r\n  7 September 2018.",

            "\"We want to discard the parts of society we dont want, but like plastic, its never going to go away.\""
        ],
        "justification": "A pair of photographs reportedly showing a severely dehydrated homeless veteran named Kent near death on the streets of Los Angeles started making their way around social media in September 2018:   These images were apparently so shocking to some viewers that they suggested the photographs perhaps showed an artwork or a Halloween decoration as opposed to a real human being. Unfortunately, these  pictures are genuine. The photographs were first posted online by Facebook user Nick Spano on 22 September 2018. The original Facebook post contained a lengthy bit of text which was largely concerned with Spano's view on how the homeless (especially homeless veterans) are treated in the United States, along with a few details about the pictured individual, who was said to be a 68-year-old man named Kent. The man told Spano that he was a veteran and that he was \"looking for a place to die\" when Spano brought him some water before paramedics arrived to take him to the hospital: posted This is America: Kent, a 68 year old veteran dying under a bush outside million dollar properties in LA. The softball size tumor on the side of his face is now a gaping hole. Dried blood covers his hands and face. Flies swarm around his head, not bothering to wait for him to die before laying their eggs in the open wound that is crawling with hundreds of maggots. He tries to speak, but I can no longer understand him. This is fucking America! Im just looking for a place to die, he said. Those were his first words to me when I first discovered Kent about a month a go in shallow bed under the bushes outside my place. Like many people, my initial gut reaction was, not in my backyard! But I know better. Im aware that homelessness is a symptom of our broken and wasteful system, and the basic lack of decency, and compassion towards one another. We treat people like trash. We want to discard the parts of society we dont want, but like plastic, its never going to go away. All we do is make the problem worse, rather than realizing that our own habits are the problem. The way we treat people is the problem. We speak to one another through our own filters, and judgements before we even get to know them. So, instead I brought Kent water, and sat down to talk with him for awhile. He pulled his hoodie aside and showed me the tumor on the side of his face. I did it to myself, he said. Years of smoking was the likely cause. He went to the VA for medical care, but he said that he felt like they were just waiting for him to die so he left. I asked if I could get him some help, but he didnt want it. Im just looking for a place to die, he said. We are all full of shit, guys. Lets be honest with ourselves. Between the look-at-me-now Instagram selfies, the woke AF Facebook posts, and the heated political rants over which party is more American, we have lost our souls. Weve sold out. Weve forgotten that real wealth comes from investing in one another. This isnt the Me Too era, its just the Me era. We are the wealthiest, and most wasteful consumer culture in the history of humankind, and we buy everything they sell us, even their excuses. We cant fix every problem! Its too big! Its too expensive! Get a job! I had to work for it, why shouldnt they?! Bullshit!!! Each bomb we dropped on Syria costs us $100 million, and weve dropped dozens. The Iraq War cost American taxpayers over $2.5 trillion dollars and counting, and it was a lie! We have our own national emergency right here in the City of Dreams, but we dont have enough money to fix it. Could you imagine what would happen if we took funding for just one of those bombs, and dropped it into social services for American communities; into shelters for the homeless; medical care for our vets; clean water for Flint?!?! Dont say we cant fix the problem, because thats bullshit. We can!!! We are just so god damn brainwashed and complacent that we dont think we actually have any power to change it. But change starts when we stop ignoring the problem, and realize that we are the ones to fix it. Even the smallest act makes a big difference. There is no one else to call! Tag! Youre fucking it! The irony of the fact that I took a photo of Kent as he lie dying outside my house while waiting for paramedics to arrive, and posted it here for all to see, isnt lost on me. This might appear hypocritical to some, but that wont change my commitment to people like Kent in my community. I will continue to treat these people with dignity and respect, and be of service anyway I can, and if in the process, this post gets at least one of you, the next time you see someone camped out on the street, to stop and talk to them; to put your hand on their shoulder; to call them brother or sister; and to restore even the slightest sense of dignity in them through a simple act of compassion, then its worth it. Not everyone can help in the same way, and sometimes people dont want help, but we all can be human to one another. As they lifted Kent onto the stretcher, he raised his hand, and gave me a peace sign. I dont know his status at this time, but I will post an update as soon as I can. People over Profits -- Compassion over Comfort  Spano updated his post a few days later but he didn't have much additional information to report: Unfortunately, there isn't much to share at this time. I finally found the hospital where Kent was taken and being treated, but due to patient privacy laws (HIPPA), and the fact that I don't know Kent's full name, they wont not give me any information at this time. I dont know if he has passed, or if he is still in their care. I have made a request to a supervisor to share my information with Kent so that he can grant me access. I've also made it clear that there are many people who want to show their support, so I'm hoping they help us make that happen. Without Kent's last name, it's difficult to verify some of the details in this Facebook post, but it doesn't bear any of the hallmarks that have revealed similar posts to be hoaxes. For instance, we could not find any record of these photographs appearing online prior to Spano's post, which supports  that Spano truly was the person who took them. This post also doesn't include a call to action urging users to share it (which is a common tactic for disingenuous clickbait). We contacted Spano for more information about Kent, and he provided us with security camera footage to verify that his photographs were authentic and noted that Kent had told him during previous interactions he was a veteran. Spano never got Kent's last name, however, and Kent didn't have any ID on him when he was taken away by paramedics. While we can't officially verify whether or not Kent was a veteran, his story is, unfortunately, rather plausible.

John W. McDaniel, 60, died Wednesday in Columbus, exactly one month after reportedly calling Gov. Mike DeWines stay-at-home order madness. If what Im hearing is true, that DeWine has ordered all bars and restaurants to be closed, I say bullshit! He doesnt have the authority,\" McDaniel reportedly wrote in a since-deleted social media post circulated widely on social media. As screenshots of McDaniel's posts went viral, many social media users took the opportunity to criticize McDaniel, saying he had received his comeuppance for calling the virus a political ploy.  McDaniel's wife, Lisa, acknowledged that her husband had made some \"early assumptions\" about the virus on social media, but added that social media users were also making unfair assumptions about him.  In a statement posted to the Snyder Funeral Homes Facebook page that announced services for McDaniel would not be live-streamed due to concerns about unwanted, negative social media reactions, she explained that McDaniel, like many others, was initially not fully aware of the severity of the pandemic. However, she wrote that he ordered the employees at his company O&M to work from home on March 16 (the day after the above-displayed Facebook post). Furthermore, according to her Facebook message, he self-isolated as soon as he was made aware that he had been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Snyder Funeral Homes Facebook page Lastly, she wrote that if he were still alive, he would have abided by the state's stay-at-home order and would have encouraged others to do the same.  Here's her statement from April 22, 2020 (emphasis ours): Words do not describe all of the emotions we, John W. McDaniel's family, are experiencing right now. We are overwhelmed with grief for the loss of our believed husband, father, soon to be father-in-law, son, brother, uncle, and dear friend to many. Similar to thousands of people, we are suffering from an unexpected and untimely loss due to the effects of COVID-19, the likes of which we never could have imagined. During this time of mourning, John's story, along with early assumptions that he stated on Twitter and Facebook have turned into national news. The news has opened the flood gates for people to share their own misguided anger and unfounded assumptions about a man they don't know. Wanting to protect my family and John's legacy, we have decided not to live stream his funeral services via Facebook today. We will be privately recording his services today and we will be sharing it directly with his family and friends. We have not come to this decision lightly and we hope everyone will honor and respect this decision.  As each day passes, we all are learning more about this \"invisible enemy.\" We have all learned that the early actions taken by our National and State government were indeed the right action to take. Quarantine and social distancing have been effective in flattening the curve. John, President of O&M, ordered the company to work from home on March 16. In addition, it is important to note that John immediately self-isolated as soon as he learned he had been in contact with someone who had tested positive. Many, like John, made statements early on not fully aware of the severity of COVID-19; many have retracted their statements knowing now the effects of this pandemic. We know if John was still here with us he would acknowledge the national crisis we're are in, abide by the stay-at-home order, and encourage family and friends to do the same. But sadly he is not with us and we will forever have to live and cope with how his life ended far too soon. Further, we will never be able to erase from our hears and minds the negative posts that have been made and shared about John this past week. To all of our family and friends, my sons and I will never be able to appropriately say \"thank you\" for all the love and support you have given us throughout this entire process. From the bottom of our hearts we will forever be grateful for you and the special relationship we share. While some may cast aspersions on McDaniel for not treating COVID-19 with the seriousness it deserved in March 2020, it should be noted that misinformation has been rampant during this pandemic. rampant We've debunked scores of rumors over several months that have touted bad medical advice and promoted conspiracy theories. U.S. President Donald Trump, too, has been criticized for downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19 and has repeatedly called the news outlets outlets covering this pandemic \"fake news.\" On Feb. 28, just two weeks before McDaniel posted on social media that COVID-19 was a \"political ploy,\" Trump said during a rally that \"Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus\" as their \"new hoax.\"  bad medical advice conspiracy theories. fake news said Brown, Bruce.  \"Its Dangerous for Public Officials to Cry Fake News During the COVID-19 Pandemic.\"\r\n  Miami Herald.  27 March 2020.

            "A meme about Manchin's vote to confirm Kavanaugh accurately notes that Heather Bresch is Manchin's daughter, but it's not clear why that's relevant."
        ],
        "justification": "In early October 2018, social media users shared a meme bearing a critical message about Sen. Joe Manchin, the lone Democrat who voted to confirm U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and his daughter, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch:   It's no secret Bresch is the daughter of the U.S. senator from West Virginia, and that father and daughter were the subjects of two very different and unrelated controversies. Bresch runs Mylan, the manufacturer of EpiPen, a medical device that delivers a dose of life-saving epinephrine to people with severe allergies which can result in a deadly reaction known as anaphylaxis. In late summer 2016, Mylan was widely criticized for hiking the price of EpiPens by more than 400 percent, taking the price of the device from $100 in 2009 to roughly $600 in 2016. anaphylaxis hiking taking Manchin, on the other hand, earned the ire of his party and other critics when he broke ranks on 6 October 2018 and voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, who had been accused by three women of sexual misconduct while he was a high school and college student, to the United States Supreme Court. One of the accusers, California college professor Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified about being assaulted as a 15-year-old, sparking an outcry and protests against Kavanaugh's confirmation. Mancin's vote broke the tie between Republican and Democratic senators, who otherwise voted along party lines. Amid the EpiPen controversy, Manchin voiced his support for his daughter, saying, \"My daughter is my daughter with unconditional love, and she's the most amazing person that I know. She's so compassionate and generous in how she's always lived her life.\" saying It was not the first time Bresch's role at Mylan was used to attack her father politically -- in fact, Manchin took heat over it from the other side of the aisle as he fought to keep his seat in the November 2018 midterm elections: heat The RNC bashed Manchin after Mylan announced it was laying off 500 people at a plant in West Virginia. Manchin has taken heat before from his opponents over Mylans decision a few years ago to jack up the price of allergy drug EpiPen by 500 percent. Amidst the layoffs and scandals, Mylan has continued to contribute to Manchin's war chest for his upcoming election, an RNC bulletin said. Mylan executives and employees contributed more than $50,000 to Manchin's campaign in the first quarter of 2018. However, barring some yet-unknown potential future ruling by Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court that might benefit Mylan, it's unclear why the meme's makers considered the familial relationship between Manchin and Bresch relevant, other than to imply some vague nefarious characteristic they supposedly share.

        "justification": "In mid-November 2015, a photograph purportedly showing what resemble common ladybugs and Japanese beetles embedded on the roof of a dog's mouth began circulating via Facebook:   Most of the users who shared the above-displayed image on Facebook included a variation of the following message: SOMEBODY ASKED ME TO PASS THIS ALONG .... Japanese Beetles and Lady Bugs can attach to the roof of your dog's mouth, and make him/HER become ill. Symptoms include excessive drooling. Check your dog's mouth and remove any insects. While we haven't been able to identify who the \"Somebody\" is in the above-quoted Facebook post, a message posted by the Hands & Paws group did provide some information about the image's origin: provide This posted photograph is recent  posted by a vet tech and when I saw the photo started doing research - because I too thought there was no way the photo could be real. There is no photoshop  there is no hidden agenda. It's just me. The Founder of a tiny little dog rescue in Florida finding the photo and the facts behind the photo amazing, astonishing and wanted to share the information with my fellow dog lovers. We reached out to Hands & Paws for more information about the image without results, but multiple incidents are on record of beetles embedding in dogs' mouths, such as this one from November 2016: this one Frances Jiriks brought her pooch Bailey into Hoisington Veterinary Hospital after he refused to eat, she told KAKE. He was also foaming at the mouth and a bit lethargic, the dog owner said. When they arrived at the animal clinic, Dr. Lindsay Mitchell discovered between 30 and 40 lady beetles clinging to the roof of Baileys mouth. The beetles look nearly identical to ladybugs though they secrete a mucus which allows them to stick, as they did inside Baileys mouth. The bugs were successfully removed from the dogs mouth, but Mitchell warned their presence could pose a variety of health risks to mans best friend. [Video here] Video here In 2008, Lindsey Derek published an article in the journal Toxicon about the subject: article A six-year old mixed-breed dog presented with severe trauma to the oral mucosa suggestive of chemical burn. Sixteen Harmonia axyridis (Coccinellidae) were removed from the oral cavity, which revealed trauma consistent with chemical burn. The beetles had become embedded in mucosa covering the hard palate and required manual removal. A diagnosis of beetle-induced chemical burn was warranted and consistent with the nature of the chemical constituents of H. axyridis hemolymph. That article also included a photograph of the beetles in the dog's mouth, which closely resembled the image circulated in November 2015:   KAKE-TV [Wichita].  \"Lady Beetles Causing Problems for Pet Owners.\"\r\n  19 October 2016.

        ],
        "justification": "Numerous allegations of sexual harassment have been made against former film executive Harvey Weinstein recently, which may be why \"satirical\" web site Freedom Junkshun was inspired to publish a story on 17 October 2017 that painted documentarian Michael Moore in a similar light. According to the site: Fox News reported Monday: While filming anti-gun movie Bowling for Columbine Sarah Slater, who was 16 at the time and on set as an extra, says Moore walked up to her and made multiple passes. \"I rejected him every time but he wouldnt take no for an answer, Slater tells Fox. He had me change into this really short skirt and he would just stare. At the end of the day, I was at a vending machine and felt a hand sliding up my thigh.\" In reality, Fox News reported no such thing. Freedom Junkshun is a long-standing publisher of false information. The site includes this disclaimer: publisher We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You wont find any of it here. Join the fun in the comments on our Facebook page where you too can watch David Hasselhoff running over someones poodle magically transformed into a crime against humanity by Barack Obama or yet another murder the Clintons got away with. However, that did not stop conservative social media users from trying to pass the story off as legitimate:     As is commonplace, other websitesConservative Columns, The Star Chronicle, USA First Information, and Defense Patriotregurgitated the fake story without including a \"satirical\" disclaimer of their own. In reality, Moore criticized Weinstein in a Facebook post on 13 October 2017, saying: saying: I have intervened on more than one occasion and I have fired men who sexually harass women. Harvey Weinstein knew better than to behave inappropriately toward women in my presence. I'm guessing successful sociopaths like him who get away with it for years are very, very careful not to let the kind of men who would stop them dead cold ever get a glimpse of who they really are. I don't live in Weinstein's Hollywood world and I make documentaries, so I can't speak to the culture he created and seemed to thrive in. I AM the only director that I know of who's actually taken Weinstein to court (for being a thief, which requires a different set of sociopathic skills, but, like sexual harassment, you can probably find them at a few Hollywood studios). All of us (men) must share the responsibility for allowing a society to exist where women do not feel safe. A society where, when they are abused, they are not able to tell their stories without fear of retribution and shame. A society that badgers, blames or scoffs at women when they tell their stories. Or how they tell their stories. Or \"how long\" it took them. They carry a burden that most of us (men) never have to experience. If you can't empathize with that or understand what they are dealing with, then maybe you're part of the problem. We contacted Moore seeking comment on Freedom Junkshun's \"story.\" Weinstein, the former co-founder of Miramax and the Weinstein Company, has been accused by more than 60 women of sexually harassment or assault in the wake of reports by both the New York Times and the New Yorker this month, detailing a pattern of alleged abuse. both and He was subsequently fired from the Weinstein Company as well as expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

When The American Mirror published this photograph on 4 September 2016, they asserted that Trump had never been accused of racism before he ran for president (which is demonstrably false) and argued that if Trump were a racist, he would have never posed for a photograph with Ali and Parks: The American Mirror false No one accused Donald Trump of being a racist until he decided to run for president and became a threat to Hillary Clintons return to power. In 1986, Trump joined several other prominent Americans, such as Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali, as recipients of an Ellis Island Award. One suspects if Trump was a racist, theres no way he would have posed for a photo with those two. The photograph is real.

She read his books, his life story, and modeled herself after him, working in commercial real estate for Crocus Group, developing social-media pages for Russian governors and regional officials, organizing federal and regional events. That day in November, Trump teamed up with Alferova, as if they were old friends. We talked as if we were equals, and I felt certain we were very much alike, she said. Trump invited her to have lunch togetherAlferova pulled up one more picture to demonstrate that there were just a few men and her waiting for lunch at the Crocus restaurant that day. When she mentioned she was interested in the real-estate business, Trump pulled out his business card and encouraged her to call him when she was in New York. Regardless of whether you think Alferova and Veselnitskaya look alike, they do share a connection -- a representative of Emin Agalarov, Alferova's former boss, was present was at the now-infamous 9 June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City between Donald Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., and Veselnitskaya, along with former campaign manager Paul Manafort and son-in-law Jared Kushner. between The meeting was arranged by Rob Goldstone, a former British tabloid writer-turned-publicist for Emin Agalarov (who is also a pop singer and featured the current U.S. president in a 2013 music video). Goldstone told Trump Jr. that the Russian government wanted to help his father win the election and that Veselnitskaya would provide deleterious information about Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. has said no useful information was provided.  music video told government has said The revelation about the meeting occurred amid an FBI investigation into whether members of the president's campaign colluded with the Russian government's meddling in the 2016 election. investigation Li, David K.\"This Russian Cat Eats Caviar While You Dont.\"\r\nNew York Post.12 March 2015.

        "justification": "We advise all readers, as well as their friends and family, to beware of Facebook ads that promise a \"stimulus\" or \"savings\" for homeowners in the amount of $3,600, $3,700, $3,712, $3,800, or another similar dollar figure. The posts featured pictures of U.S. President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and members of Congress, among others. Some ads also mentioned the term, \"mortgage refinance stimulus.\"  Examples of some of the Facebook ads.  The ads gave the appearance that Biden and the U.S. government voted through a plan to provide $3,600, $3,700, $3,712, $3,800, or another similar amount of money as a \"stimulus\" or \"savings\" in the form of check payments to help homeowners. The pictures and text perhaps looked and felt similar to the previous COVID-19 economic impact payments and child tax credit payments that Americans became familiar with in 2020 and 2021. Those genuine payments came directly from the Internal Revenue Service. economic impact payments child tax credit payments However, there is no federal plan to distribute $3,600, $3,700, $3,712, or $3,800 \"stimulus\" or \"savings\" checks to homeowners. Facebook users who clicked on the ads were led to websites that were not operated by the government. From there, they all appeared to lead to a central page: GovHomePrograms.com. This website included a brief survey that asked questions about finances, home value, and mortgage status. The forms also asked for a name, email address, phone number, and mailing address. GovHomePrograms.com We filled out the forms and were then led to one or more lenders that could help future homeowners to buy a house or current homeowners to refinance a mortgage. There was no evidence that the Facebook ads led to a way for homeowners to obtain a $3,600, $3,700, $3,712, or $3,800 \"stimulus\" or \"savings\" payment from the government. According to GovHomePrograms.com's terms of service and privacy policy pages, its parent company was RateMarketplace.com. Plateau Data Services, LLC was also mentioned in the documentation. terms of service privacy policy RateMarketplace.com One page led to EnhancedRefiNow.com instead of GovHomePrograms.com. Its parent company appeared to be LMB Mortgage Services, Inc., also known as LowerMyBills.com. EnhancedRefiNow.com As of December 2021, at least eight Facebook pages named American Savings Tips, Wise American Solution, Clever American Choices, New American Community, US Relief, StraightFix, Homeowners of America, and Our Best American Life had spent around $200,000 on advertising since late October to promote the ads. One of the biggest spenders was Wise American Solution, which had spent nearly $60,000 alone in early December, as of Dec. 13. American Savings Tips Wise American Solution Clever American Choices New American Community US Relief StraightFix Homeowners of America Our Best American Life spent In other words, at least millions of Facebook users had been served the ads from these pages on Facebook or Instagram.  The American Savings Tips Facebook page spent nearly $60,000 on ads between Oct. 27 and Dec. 7. It also misleadingly showed a picture of a U.S. Treasury check for $3,600.  The Facebook pages and their corresponding websites were all brand new and were created in either October or November 2021. Another page named Helpers Today also pushed similar ads about a \"stimulus\" or \"savings\" for homeowners. Helpers Today Several hours after we started investigating Clever American Choices, its Facebook page became unavailable. It's unclear why this happened within those few hours and not at any time in previous weeks. According to its advertising information, Clever American Choices was \"deleted\" after violating Facebook's advertising policies. It had spent at least $45,209 on Facebook ads between Nov. 21 and Dec. 7. The other pages also showed advertising violations. advertising information advertising violations After we clicked on one of the Facebook ads and landed on a website, we noticed this message at the bottom: \"THIS IS AN ADVERTORIAL AND NOT AN ACTUAL NEWS ARTICLE, BLOG, OR CONSUMER PROTECTION UPDATE.\" at the bottom We also found a list of \"disclaimers\" in small print spaced far below the end of most of the body of the page that was meant \"for Facebook reviewers and 3rd party fact checkers.\" One of the lines attempted to clarify why words like \"government\" and \"Biden\" were used in the copy: 5. \"Government\" , \"Biden\" , \"New Administration\" , \"Relief\" - assume multiple citations below from the following article: \"Biden's $10 billion in financial assistance is expected to be available in 2022.\" https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-signed-10-billion-mortgage-133000243.html https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-signed-10-billion-mortgage-133000243.html It's true that the Biden administration previously created a Homeowners Assistance Fund that's meant to \"provide states with $10 billion to help struggling homeowners catch up on their mortgage payments and utility costs.\" It's also true that the assistance was still being given out by various states as of November 2021. But nowhere in this plan did we find anything about a $3,600, $3,700, $3,712, or $3,800 \"stimulus\" or \"savings\" plan for homeowners in the same way that past stimulus checks worked, as the Facebook ads appeared to hint at. Homeowners Assistance Fund still being given out One of the posts on Clever American Choices originally read: \"This was featured on FoxNews [sic] last night. All I did was enter my zip and now I'm getting $3,600 back in savings. It was free to check, Just Enter Zip!\" read A seemingly endless number of Facebook users then submitted their ZIP codes in the comments under the ads instead of on the resulting website, perhaps believing this would lead to them being contacted to receive a $3,600 check.  Not only did this ad show a fake \"Homeowner Relief Card,\" but members of former U.S. President Donald Trump's Cabinet can be seen sitting in the photograph captured in Congress.  Aside from the ZIP code comments, the remarks with the most likes caught our eye. For example, a user named Jackie said: \"This was featured in CNN yesterday so I guess I could try it since my neighbors already got theirs.\" Other ads mentioned C-SPAN. We found no record of CNN, Fox News, or C-SPAN recently broadcasting news of a specific $3,600, $3,700, $3,712, or $3,800 \"stimulus\" or \"savings\" for homeowners. Also, no one's \"neighbors already got\" a $3,600 stimulus check payment, because they don't exist.  These comments likely convinced quite a few people to give away their personal information.  Ben commented: \"Wow! I've never seen anything like this before! Thank god that I saw it today so I can signup.\" Matt remarked: \"Heard about this program form [sic] my neighbor. They got the check yesterday so I tried it and received a notification that my check will be here this week!\" We also saw the same names making the same comments in multiple ads. It's unclear if these people worked for the websites or companies that were affiliated with the posts. We reached out to the Better Business Bureau and AARP for comment on these ads and websites. The BBB responded and told us that this is what they would refer to as a classic \"government imposter scam.\" A BBB spokesperson told us: \"Without further research, its hard to tell if this is just a way to get homeowners to apply for refinancing, or if the motive is fraud. Consumers are being asked to share personally identifiable information (PII), and thats a huge red flag because it is everything needed for identity theft. The fact that the domains are new is another red flag. BBB advises consumers never to share personal information with someone who has solicited them, whether through email, social media ad, text, etc., but to carefully vet any new company that needs PII.\" In a study, the BBB found that these sorts of scams increased in 2020 and 2021 with the COVID-19 pandemic. They also sent over a page about government grant scams and a scam alert about stimulus checks. study government grant scams a scam alert about stimulus checks We also heard from Kathy Stokes, director of fraud prevention for the AARP Fraud Watch Network. In an email, Stokes told us: \"It is safe to say that ads that pitch free money from the government are government grant scams and the internet, particularly Facebook, is teeming with them. Sometimes youll see your Facebook friends share the information, claim they got money from a grant, and encourage you to get your free money, too. Often that means the friends Facebook account has been hacked. Whether it is a scammer or an actual company, you should report the ads to the FTC. These sites often ask for you to share your personal information, which can be dangerous for the person entering it.\" AARP In sum, the Facebook ads that promised a \"stimulus\" or \"savings\" for homeowners simply appeared to be a way to route future homeowners to lenders or to show current homeowners where they could refinance their mortgages. With guidance from the BBB and AARP on identifying this as a \"government imposter scam\" or \"government grant scam,\" we have rated this story accordingly with the \"Scam\" rating. The rating for this fact check was changed from \"False\" to \"Scam\" after we received guidance in a response from the Better Business Bureau and AARP. We also added several more Facebook pages and updated the advertising dollar figure to be around $200,000.",

        "justification": "Claim:  Photographs show a pair of albino moose alongside a highway. MIXTURE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, January 2007] \nOnce in awhile there is an opportunity to take in a piece of nature that you may never see. The photographer of the following photos (unknown)  was one lucky person. In these days of unrest and turmoil it is great to see that Mother Nature can still produce some wondrous beauty. The odds of seeing an albino moose are astronomical and to see two of them together is nearly impossible. We wanted to share these photos with as many people as possible because you will probably never have a chance to see this rare sight again. This is a really special treat, so enjoy the shot of a life time. These animals were photographed just north of the Wisconsin border on a highway near Marenisco, MI. Someone asked if there is anything mystical about this sighting. I do not know but I do know that I really enjoy looking at them. I am pretty sure that if you send them to five friends nothing magical will happen except you will know that you have shared a unique experience that they will never see again... ENJOY \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \n\n\n\n\n  Origins:   Tracking down the origins of these  photographs of a pair of \"albino moose\" along a highway has not been a straightforward task, because these critters are apparently wide-roaming moose: differing versions of the accompanying text have placed them all across North America, from British Columbia to the Maritime provinces in Canada, and from Michigan to Maine in the United States.   As best we can ascertain, the pictures date from mid-2006 and were taken somewhere in eastern Canada. (Various claimants have asserted they snapped these pictures in northern Ontario, Newfoundland, and New Brunswick.) Ontario Newfoundland  However, although the photographs may be genuine, the animals pictured are likely not true albinos but rather white-colored (or \"white-haired\") moose, an unusual genetic variation of the species that has been spotted in several states and provinces: white-colored \n\nIn general, moose have brown coats of hair. In some rare cases, the colour of moose coats can range from predominantly white to a mixture of white and brown. White-coloured moose are not a separate species, but are examples of a rare colour phase that can occur naturally in wild moose populations. White-coloured moose have been reported in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Newfoundland, Alaska and Idaho. Restrictions on the hunting of white-coloured moose were put in place for the Port au Port Peninsula in 2002 by Newfoundland and Labrador. No other province has hunting regulations prohibiting the harvest of white-coloured moose.\n In 2002 the state of Idaho took similar steps to protect a particular white moose during hunting season: \n\nA group of eastern Idahoans smitten by a white moose have persuaded the state to make the animal off-limits to hunters. Steve Huffaker, director of the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, made an emergency order making it illegal to shoot the albino cow moose, which has been  spotted with a black calf on private land in southeastern Idaho. The moose hunting season opened [a few days ago]. The move came after the Fish and Game Commission received calls and petitions from residents near Soda Spring pleading for the animal's protection. Albino moose have been showing up in the area for several years, said Dale Toweill, trophy species manager for the fish and game department. Normally, only 1 in 100,000 moose have the albino trait, which is recessive. But the gene appears to run in the herd in southeastern Idaho, where Toweill theorizes the probability of an albino moose may be 1 in 10,000.\n In October 2009 the above-displayed photographs were combined with a set featuring another white moose (described in the accompanying text as a \"Beautiful Snow Moose\"):  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n      We don't yet know the specific origins of this second set of photos, but contextual evidence suggests the pictures were taken in the western U.S. or Canada.

My friends daughter went missing on 12/04/14 in Georgia and the people we believe are guilty are involved in sex trafficking. PLEASE repost and ask others to do the same , even if you don't know anyone in that area someone you know just might. Every little bit helps us get one step closer to her daughter coming home safely!!! Her name is Mikala White and she was abducted in the Marietta/Smyrna Georgia area. If you have any tips or any information please call (772)323-7980 - with Charlace Pamela Gent.\n\n   Origins:  On 8 December 2014,  Facebook user Kayla Delehant posted the above-quoted message to her Facebook page regarding missing Cherokee County, Georgia, teenager Mikala White. Delehant's initial post was widely seen and shared in the days following its publication to Facebook. However, the original plea to find White lacked one key aspect: her name. While a clear and recent photograph was attached to the message and relevant contact information was shared, many concerned readers mistakenly assumed Kayla Delehant was the name of the missing teenager. Delehant identified herself in the message as a friend of White's mother, Charlace Gent. On 15 December, Delehant updated her message to include White's name, but many viewers did not see the update. The original message is otherwise accurate: Mikala White, 15, disappeared in Cobb County on 4 December 2014. The teen was last seen on a school bus but was absent from classes on the day she vanished. A Facebook page dedicated to spreading the word about missing people posted the following status update on 18 December 2014: page \n\nMissing Mikala White, age 15, a student at Cherokee High School in CANTON, GEORGIA got on the bus December 4th, 2014 but never made it to class, and authorities in Cherokee and Cobb counties are continuing to search for her. Cobb authorities were alerted to the situation because the girl is believed to possibly be in Cobb County. Mikala is about 5'4\" tall, has brown hair and green eyes. Anyone with information regarding Mikala's whereabouts should call 911, or Cobb County Police at (770) 499-3900 or the Cherokee County School District Police Department at (770) 704-4346 or the Cobb County Sheriff's Office at (770) 499-4600.\n\n A local news source confirmed White disappeared on 4 December 2014: confirmed \n\n\"On the morning of Dec. 4, Cherokee High School student rode a CCSD school bus from the group home where she lives to the school, but she did not report to class or return to the group home,\" said Barbara Jacoby, spokesperson for the school district. \"The CCSD Police Department reported her as a runaway to the Cherokee Sheriff's Office, as well as to the Cobb and Marietta police departments, as she is believed to possibly be in Cobb County. Her information also was entered into the GCIC/NCIC database.\"\n\n Authorities stated Mikala White might have traveled to neighboring Cobb County, but did not provide any additional information on the teen's disappearance or the circumstances under which she went missing.  On 19 December Mikala was found by police a few miles from where she had been reported missing two weeks earlier. She and another girl said they had been staying in an abandoned home nearby. They were both arrested by the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department and charged as runaways. charged Last updated:  18 December 2014\n ",

        ],
        "justification": "As wildfires raged across Australia at the start of 2020, an interesting claim about wombats, a short-legged marsupial, started to circulate on social media. According to this rumor, wombats were braving the fires to find lost animals and then leading them back to their burrows for safety: rumor   Reports from Australia that countless small animals have escaped death because wombats, unusually, opted to share their massive, complex burrows. Even reports that they have been observed exhibiting \"sheperding behavior.\" While this social media post claims that it is based on \"reports from Australia,\" we have seen no documentation of these supposed hero wombats. In fact, a number of Australian experts have said that they were skeptical of the claims. Jackie French, author and director of The Wombat Foundation, told IFLScience: IFLScience \"Wombats are extremely short-sighted. They focus mostly on food and dirt. It would be hard for them to see well enough to shepherd, nor have I seen one do so.\" Scott Carver, a senior lecturer in wildlife ecology at the University of Tasmania, told the Associated Press no evidence exists that wombats were \"sharing or encouraging other animals\" to take refuge in their burrows. Associated Press While wombats may not actively be seeking out animals in need, it is quite possible that distressed creatures have found their way into wombat burrows on their own. Wombats are efficient diggers and can create burrows stretching up to 650 feet. Associate Professor Steve Johnston from the University of Queensland also noted that wombats may abandon these underground tunnels in order to dig a new one. This leaves some opportunities for other animals to seek shelter. 650 feet Johnston told the Brisbane Times: Brisbane Times \"A lot of those wombat burrows could be empty, so animals could easily make their way into those burrows to escape the fire ... Wombats will often make a burrow system and then move on, so those empty burrows become open [to other animals].\" Wombats are typically very territorial and will even charge and chase out animals that invade their space. However, students at the University of Melbourne set up cameras near one wombat burrow in 2019 and found other animals, including koalas and bunnies, venturing inside these underground tunnels. Kath Handasyde, an expert in native mammal ecology and physiology, said that the wombat was likely sleeping or in another chamber when these other animals explored the burrow. Here's a video where she explains the situation. video In short, wombats are not actively shepherding animals into their burrows for safety. However, it is certainly possible that animals fleeing the fires have taken refuge in the wombats' underground tunnels. In fact, the Center for Biological Diversity shared a video taken during the Australian fires in 2020 showing how one animal, the common brown butterfly, was using wombat holes to survive the flames:   Greenpeace Australia, the social media account that posted the viral message recounted in this story's introduction, later updated its Instagram post to remove the \"shepherding\" part of the claim: Instagram   Dupuy, Beatrice.  \"Wombats Not Herding Animals Into Their Burrows During Australia Fires.\"\r\n  Associated Press.  14 January 2020.

The disgusting feminists of the world have officially outdone themselves. They've now launched a new project dubbed \"Raising the Skirt,\" which calls on women to perform a sick act in public. Case in point: Some of the more enthusiastic social justice warriors of the feminist movement have begun a project called \"Raising the Skirt,\" aimed at \"celebrating the diversity of vaginas.\" This is not a drill. There are actual women gathering with the sole purpose of raising their skirts, exposing their most intimate part to complete strangers. And they call it a celebration.

A photograph labeled as \"feminists ... screaming through their vaginas\" at President Trump was taken in or earlier than February 2016, and was later attributed to artist Nicola Canavan's \"Raising the Skirt\" series of portraits. Canavan's work was not a \"feminist trend,\" but rather a photography project undertaken on a relatively small scale. We contacted Canavan, who confirmed that this is one of her images.

        "justification": "An Internet meme circulating during the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign purported to reveal financial trickery on the part of Democratic contender Hillary Clinton, who allegedly deducted $1 million from her 2015 income tax return after donating it \"to herself\" via contributions to the Clinton Foundation. On the assumption that this information came from the candidate's 2015 tax filing (released to the public earlier this year), that's where we went to verify the accuracy of the claims. Our findings were these: filing 1. The return was a joint filing for both Hillary and William J. Clinton. 2. Their shared charitable donations totaled $1,042,000: $42,000 to Desert Classic Charities and $1 million to the Clinton Family Foundation. Desert Classic Charities Clinton Family Foundation   3. Declaring an amount  say $1 million  as a charitable donation only reduces your taxable income; it doesn't mean your \"tax bill\" is reduced by that amount. 4. The Clinton Family Foundation is a separate entity from the Clinton Foundation. Inside Philanthropy describes the Clinton Family Foundation as \"a traditional private foundation that serves as the vehicle for the couple's personal charitable giving.\" It has neither staff nor offices.  Clinton Foundation describes 5. According to Inside Philanthropy, the Clinton Family Foundation regularly disburses contributions to scores of different charities (one of which is, in fact, the Clinton Foundation): Digging into the Clinton Family Foundation's 2014 tax return reveals that they did around $3.8 million in grantmaking and held some $5.3 million in assets. Of total grantmaking in 2014, $1.8 million went to the Clinton Foundation, just under half of total giving.  2014 tax return However, in 2013, the Clintons gave $1.8 million through their personal foundation, with only around a fifth of that money going to the Clinton Foundation, around the same share as in 2012.  So where have all the other gifts gone? To lots of different places, is the short answer. In 2014, the Clintons gave money to 70 nonprofits through their foundation. The picture looked similar the year before, with many grants falling in the range of $5,000 to $25,000.  Recipients of the Clintons' largesse via the Clinton Family Foundation in 2014 ranged from the School of American Ballet to the Arkansas Childrens Hospital Foundation to Wellesley College to the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. 2014 The foundation's 2015 tax filing has not yet been made public, so we don't have an accounting of the organizations to whom the $1 million contributed by the Clintons that year was disbursed. Regarding the apparent assumption that any monies donated to the Clinton Foundation simply end up in the Clintons' own pockets, we refer readers, once again, to Inside Philanthropy, which describes the actual work the foundation does, and to the charity rating service Charity Navigator, which gives the Clinton Foundation an overall score of 94.74 points out of 100 in terms of its financials, accountability, and transparency.

In May 2015, a fraudulent offer for $100 Lowe's coupons started circulating on Facebook. The message linked Facebook users to a fraudulent web site adorned with the Lowe's logo, and instructed them to follow a simple set of instructions:  Scams like these require users to pass the fake coupon on to their Facebook friends, which widens the pool of potential victims. Next, they direct people to fill out a simple survey, which seems like a harmless task but is used to coax sensitive information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and credit card numbers out of victims.

If the survey is real, you may be entered in a drawing to win a gift card or receive a small discount off your next purchase. Few businesses can afford to give away $50 gift cards for completing a few questions.\n Lowe's also posted a warning about this scam on their Facebook page: Facebook  In April 2017, two years after we first debunked the initial coupon scam, a new version of it appeared, taking in unsuspecting Facebookers yet again:  Those who clicked on this image on Facebook were taken to a page with a dubious URL& (in this case, https://www.lowes.com-holdit.us/?sfpzbJt) and asked to take a simple survey and then to \"like\" and \"share\" the page:  Needless to say, anyone who attempted to redeem these coupons at Lowe's will be unsuccessful (and probably a little embarrassed), and if they have followed the online instructions, they have set themselves and their friends on social media up for, at best, a like-farming scam.

If true, that would put him in his twenties. Clue #2 that the information is false: In the viral graphic, Atkinson's age was given as 58. In reality, he was 62 at the time (as of 2017), having been born in 1955. Clue #3 that the information is false: Nowhere, in any legitimate media, has it been reported that Rowan Atkinson passed away.    In fact, Atkinson is currently starring in the third installment of the Johnny English comedy film series, to be released in October 2018: starring  The errors and inconsistencies in the hoax reports of his death are attributable to the fact that a virtually identical hoax has circulated before and has been repurposed, with little or no attention to detail, in 2016 and thereafter. The most important thing to know about it is that the hoax is also a \"clickjacking\" scam. If you click on the blurb expecting to see a video or get more information, what you will find instead is that you have been redirected to another website that will attempt to get you to share your personal info, request access to your Facebook account, demand that you fill out a survey before proceeding, or all of the above.",

Sir, it's time we had a talk......... During your campaign, Americans watched as you made mockery of our tradition of standing and crossing your heart when the Pledge of Allegiance was spoken. You, out of four people on the stage, were the only one not honoring our tradition. YES, \"We noticed.\" During one of your many speeches, Americans heard you say that you intended to visit all 57 states. We all know that Islam, not America has 57 states. YES, \"We noticed.\" When President Bush leaned over at Ground Zero and gently placed a flower on the memorial, while you nonchalantly tossed your flower onto the pile without leaning over. YES, \"We noticed.\" Every time you apologized to other countries for America's position on an issue we have wondered why you don't share our pride in this great country. When you have heard foreign leaders berate our country and our beliefs, you have not defended us. In fact, you insulted the British Crown beyond belief. YES, \"We noticed.\" When your pastor of 20 years, \"God-damned America\" and said that 9/11 was \"America's chickens coming home to roost\" and you denied having heard recriminations of that nature, we wondered how that could be. You later disassociated yourself from that church and  Pastor Wright because it was politically expedient to do so. YES, \"We noticed.\" When you announced that you would transform America, we wondered why. With all her faults, America is the greatest country on earth. Sir, KEEP THIS IN MIND, \"if not for America and the people who built her, you wouldn't be sitting in the White House now.\" Prior to your election to the highest office in this Country, you were a senator from Illinois and from what we can glean from the records available, not a very remarkable one. YES, \"We noticed.\" All through your campaign and even now, you have surrounded yourself with individuals who are basically unqualified for the positions for which you appointed them. Worse than that, the majority of them are people who, like you, bear no special allegiance, respect, or affection for this country and her traditions. YES, \"We noticed.\" You are seven months into your term and every morning millions of Americans wake up to a new horror heaped on us by you. You seek to saddle working Americans with a health care/insurance reform package that, along with cap and trade, will bankrupt this nation. YES, \"We noticed.\" We seek, by protesting, to let our representatives know that we are not in favor of these crippling expenditures and we are labeled\n\"un-American\", \"racist\", \"mob\". We wonder how we are supposed to let you know how frustrated we are. You have attempted to make our protests seem isolated and insignificant. Until your appointment, Americans had the right to speak out. YES, \"We noticed.\" On September 11, 2001 there were no Republicans or Democrats, only Americans. And we all grieved together and helped each other in whatever way we could. The attack on 9/11 was carried out because we are Americans. And YES, \"We noticed.\" There were many of us who prayed that as a black president you could help unite this nation. In seven months you have done more to destroy this nation than the attack on 9/11. You have failed us. YES, \"We noticed.\" September 11 is a day of remembrance for all Americans. You propose to make 9/11 a \"National Service Day\". While we know that you don't share our reverence for 9/11, we pray that history will report your proposal as what it is...a disgrace. YES, \"We noticed.\" You have made a mockery of our Constitution and the office that you hold. You have embarrassed and slighted us in foreign visits and policy.  YES, \"We noticed..\" We have noticed all these things. We will deal with you. When Americans come together again, it will be to remove you from office. Take notice. If you agree with this please pass it on.\n Origins:  \"We Noticed,\" the above-quoted piece critical of President Obama, began circulating on the Internet in September 2009.  It has commonly been attributed to Sherry Hackett, the widow of comedian Buddy Hackett, but versions identifying her as its author did not appear until well after the text had been widely spread across the Internet.

        "justification": "In October 2022, we received reader mail about a \"Whole Foods Market Research\" scam. The scam arrives in the form of an email, text, or mailed letter, and claims that the recipient has been chosen to be a secret shopper for Whole Foods Market. The goal of the scammer is to get the recipient to deposit a check into the recipient's bank account. However, unbeknownst to the recipient, the check is fake. The scammer is to quickly task the recipient to buy gift cards and then provide the identifying details on the front and back. Alternatively, the scammer might ask the recipient to initiate a wire transfer or money order to send back a partial amount of the funds from the check. The scammer claims that the recipient can keep a portion of the funds for the work. However, again, the check is fake, so recipients are spending their own money to buy gift cards for the scammers. We reviewed one example of this scam that arrived as an email. It came from wholefoodsmarketresearchllc@gmail.com, which was not an official Whole Foods email address. It claimed to come from a person named Jerry A. Wallace, a purported human resources (HR) representative. A previous version of this scam named Wallace as a \"project manager,\" according to scampulse.com. We found no evidence of a person with this name being a real employee for Whole Foods. according to scampulse.com  The original email, which contained several store name misspellings, read as follows: wholefoodsmarketresearchllc@gmail.com wrote: Attn: (name removed) You submitted your information to one of our recruitment agencies to work as a Whole Foods Market Research representative.

Thats when someone sends you a check and convinces you to deposit it and quickly send them money. In this scam, the recruiter would send shoppers a check for more than $2,000 and they would: fake check scam 1. Cash or deposit the check immediately.2. Buy gift cards with most of the money.3. Keep about $450 as their pay.4. Scratch the coating off the gift cards to show the PIN codes.5. Send pictures of the cards front and back (with the codes) to the recruiter. If anyone ever tells you to deposit a check, withdraw money, and send it to someone, thats a scam. When the check later turns out to be fake, the bank will want the money back. And if anyone tells you to go buy gift cards and share the PIN numbers, thats a scam, too. Once the scammer has the PIN, they also have all the money from the cards. The FTC said this scam can be reported at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. They also added, \"If you already cashed a fake check and sent money to a scammer, find out how to report to gift card, wire transfer, and money order businesses.\" ReportFraud.ftc.gov find out how In sum, both we and the FTC advise consumers to not respond to any emails, texts, or mailed letters that invite recipients to work as a secret shopper for \"Whole Foods Market Research.\" How To Spot, Avoid, and Report Fake Check Scams.

        ],
        "justification": "On 5 May 2015, a photograph purportedly showing a fisherman holding a furry trout was posted to the web site of a local Wisconsin news station: photograph \n Wanted to share a rather remarkable catch I had this afternoon. I was fishing the Menomonee River where some trout were packed into a bottleneck. I caught a few and nothing was out of the ordinary until I reeled this one in. I have never seen anything like it. I contacted a local wildlife official and they referred to it as a rare fur-bearing trout. They went on to explain that this was an extreme case of Saprolegnia, or cotton mold. Apparently old Great Lakes legends spoke of these as a uniquely evolved trout species that existed only in the deepest, coldest parts of the lakes and needed the fur to stay warm. I doubt it will make Cabella's non-traditional mount wall but I'm still excited to reel in a genuine Wisconsin legend! You have my permission to share and use this photo in any form you'd like. You can credit George Weber. Im a 41 year old carpenter and live in Wauwatosa.\n The image was picked up by several web sites such as Unexplained Mysteries and Cult of Weird and soon prompted an Internet debate about the existence of furry trout.  Unexplained Mysteries Cult of Weird Although there is no species of fish called \"furry trout,\" a genus of freshwater mold (also called cotton mold) known as Saprolegnia does grow on diseased fish and lends them a somewhat furred appearance. But unlike the picture of the fish seen in the above-displayed photograph, this mold typically grows in patches and doesn't resemble fluffy white fur: resemble   So if this fish isn't suffering from Saprolegnia, then is this a real furry trout?   Stories about fur-bearing trout have been circulating for years, but that mythical creature still exists only in the imaginary realm. One common form of the myth is that the species came about as the result of a hair tonic spill in the Arkansas river, while another theory holds that this furry fish evolved to grow a thick coat in order to survive in the cold waters of Alaska: theory \nSome of those tall tales of the West are partly true, no matter how ridiculous they sound. As noted in the first installment of Roaming Wyoming, jackalope may be fake, but science does support the existence of rabbits that may look like they have horns. Is there a factual basis behind the story of the fur-bearing trout? So far, not one has been found. Just plenty of good-natured humor. The fur-bearing trout, also called the furry fish, beaver trout, or (probably jokingly) the sabled salmon, is said to live wherever water becomes cold enough to warrant a warm winter coat. This includes all of Canada, and most of the far northern states of the United States (including Wyoming). The most publicized encounter with the fur-bearing trout appeared in a 1929 issue of Montana Wildlife magazine, the official publication of the Montana State Fish and Game Department. Mr. J.H. Hicken of Whitefish, Montana, told his story in colorful detail. Mr. Hicken snagged a furry fish at a lake in Glacier National Park where the water was so cold it was below the freezing point. But, \"Nature has taken care of her own by providing the fish with a thick coat of fur,\" Mr. Hicken remarked. He did add that since the fish are so cold, \"the change of temperature from this water to atmosphere is so great that the fish explodes upon being taken from the water, and fur and skin come off in one perfect piece, making it available for commercial purposes, and leaving the body of the fish for refrigerator purposes or eating, as desired.\"\n Real furry trout do not exist, but these fictional creatures can sometimes be spotted mounted on the walls of hunting lodges and museums. According to The Beasts That Hide from Man: Seeking the World's Last Undiscovered Animals, one of the most famous examples of the furry trout was hanging in the Royal Museum of Scotland until it was revealed to be a hoax. A local taxidermist admitted that he had covered the fish with white rabbit fur: famous  While we can't definitively say if this Wisconsin fisherman covered his fish in rabbit fur, it's clear that this catch has more in common with a widely spread hoax than it does with freshwater mold.

For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry. For beautiful hair, let a child run his or her fingers through it once a day. For poise, walk with the knowledge that you never walk alone. People, even more than things, have to be restored, renewed, revived, reclaimed and redeemed; never throw out anyone. Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, youll find one at the end of each of your arms. As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands, one for helping yourself, the other for helping others. The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides. The beauty of a woman is not in a facial mode, but the true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It is the caring that she lovingly gives and the passion that she shows.

This video was originally posted in 2013 and shows a behind-the-scenes look at the making of \"Invasion Planet Earth\" (originally titled \"Kaleidoscope Man\"), a sci-fi adventure movie about an alien invasion.

Invasion Planet Earth Kaleidoscope Man  Another version of this rumor hinged on the claim that the news media was sharing an abbreviated version of this video that only showed people running (with no hints of a camera crew) in order to exaggerate the state of affairs in Ukraine. By claiming that a miscaptioned version of this footage was being shared by the news media, social media users could claim that this was an example of \"globalist propaganda.\"   But we have not found a single post from a genuine news outlet that presented this footage as if it were real. The \"news outlet\" included the above-displayed screenshot is a weeks-old Twitter account, @mightyfarooz200, that has no apparent connections to any credible news outlet. This video was not filmed in Ukraine during Russia's invasion of the country. It does not show crisis actors and it was not shared as if it were genuine footage of Russia's invasion as reported by credible media news outlets. However, this is still a good example of propaganda, just not in the way that it's being presented online. This footage was widely circulated on social media with one of two claims: First, that it showed Ukrainian \"crisis actors\" filming a propaganda video, and second that the news media was using miscaptioned footage to misrepresent the situation in Ukraine. Neither of these claims were true. Our search for postings of this video turned up dozens of far-right accounts sharing this video as if it showed crisis actors, and practically zero postings of people sharing this video as if it showed a genuine attack. In other words, this video was widely shared by those attempting to downplay the violence by Russians in Ukraine, not by those attempting to exaggerate it.

Any truth here?  I already know how the Constitution treats such things.  Now days, it doesn't seem to matter tho.\n \n Has FEMA struck an agreement with Russia that will provide for the Russian Military to provide crowd control at U.S. events on American Soil?  This was reported as true in a post I saw on FB and reported that these soldiers would be able to fire on and kill Americans on U.S. soil.\n Origins:  On 26 June 2013, Russia announced an agreement between the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry  to share information and observation opportunities with first responders and emergency managers from each other's countries during joint rescue operations: announced \n\nThe Russian Emergency Situations Ministry and the USA Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are going to exchange experts during joint rescue operations in major disasters. This is provided by a protocol of the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential  Commission Working Group on Emergency Situations and seventeenth meeting of Joint U.S.-Russia Cooperation Committee on Emergency Situations, which took place in Washington on 25 June. The document provides for expert cooperation in disaster response operations and to study the latest practices. In addition, the parties approved of U.S.-Russian cooperation in this field in 2013-2014, which envisages exchange of experience including in monitoring and forecasting emergency situations, training of rescuers, development of mine-rescuing and provision of security at mass events. At the end of the meeting the parties expressed their satisfaction with the level of cooperation between the Russian Federation and the United States in the area of emergency prevention and response and agreed to develop it in order to respond efficiently to all kinds of disasters.\n The conspiracy site Infowars then spun this announcement into a claim that Russian military forces would be providing security for large events in the United States such as the Super Bowl and presidential inaugurations: Infowars \n\nAs part of a deal signed last week in Washington DC between the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry and FEMA, Russian officials will provide \"security at mass events\" in the United States, a scenario that wont sit well with Americans wary of foreign assets operating on US soil. According to a press release by the Ministry of the Russian Federation for Civil Defense and Emergencies, US and Russian officials met on June 25 at the 17th Joint U.S.-Russia Cooperation Committee on Emergency Situations. In addition to agreeing with FEMA to \"exchange experts during joint rescue operations in major disasters,\" the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry will also be providing \"security at mass events\" in the United States. This suggests that events designated as \"National Special Security Events\" by the Department of Homeland Security, which include the Super Bowl, international summits such as the G8 and presidential inaugurations, will now rely partly on Russian authorities to provide security.\n However, the Infowars article was an alarmist, far-fetched interpretation of the original announcement, which said nothing about Russia's providing security for events taking place within the U.S.  The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry announcement merely noted that \"provision of security at mass events\" was one of the areas of interest which the two countries hoped to study and learn about from each other as part of their joint agreement. FEMA and the Russian news agency RIA Novosti quickly debunked Infowars' unsupported assumption, stating plainly that the U.S. and Russia would not be deploying security guards or military forces in each other's countries: \n\nThe top US emergency response agency moved to quell a flurry of Internet-driven speculation that Russian security teams could be deployed at large public events in the United States, saying the two countries will not swap security guards or soldiers under a long-running partnership agreement. There will be \"no exchange of security or military personnel\" under a recently renewed partnership between the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Russias Emergency Situations Ministry, a FEMA spokesman told RIA Novosti. \"The agreement continues information-sharing meetings and observation opportunities with first responders and emergency managers,\" the spokesman said. Picking up on an Emergency Situations Ministry statement declaring that partnership agreement \"envisages the exchange of experience\" in \"the provision of security at mass events,\" numerous websites suspicious of the US governments encroachment on its citizens' rights suggested the deal means Russian security guards could be deployed at major public gatherings. The libertarian website Infowars.com, run by radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, proposed these events could include US presidential inaugurations and the Super Bowl. The FEMA spokesman said that while the US agency will not exchange security or military personnel with its Russian counterpart, the two sides \"agreed to an exchange of emergency management experts to share best practices  a continuation of a 17 year partnership.\"\n Last updated:   2 July 2013\n",

        "justification": "Claim:  Photographs show Nick Vujicic, a man born without limbs. \nStatus:  Incomplete.\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, August 2007] \n\n\n... after reading this young man's story ... I was touched & humbled. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    My name is Nick Vujicic and I give God the Glory for how He has used my testimony to touch thousands of hearts around the world! I was born without limbs and doctors have no medical explanation for this birth \"defect\". As you can imagine, I was faced with many challenges and obstacles. \"Consider it pure joy, my Brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds.\" .... To count our hurt, pain and struggle as nothing but pure joy? As my parents were Christians, and my Dad even a Pastor of our church, they knew that verse very well. However, on the morning of the 4th of December 1982 in Melbourne ( Australia ), the last two words on the minds of my parents was \"Praise God!\". Their firstborn son had been born without limbs! There were no warnings or time to prepare themselves for it. The doctors were shocked and had no answers at all! There is still no medical reason why this had happened and Nick now has a Brother and Sister who were born just like any other baby. The whole church mourned over my birth and my parents were absolutely devastated. Everyone asked, \"if God is a God of Love, then why would God let something this bad happen to not just anyone, but dedicated Christians?\" My Dad thought I wouldn't survive for very long, but tests proved that I was a healthy baby boy  just with a few limbs missing.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \"And we know that in all things God works for the best for those who love Him.\" That verse spoke to my heart and convicted me to the point where that I know that  there is no such thing as luck, chance or coincidence that these \"bad\" things happen in our life. I had complete peace knowing that God won't let anything happen to us in our life unless He has a good purpose for it all. I completely gave my life to Christ at the age of fifteen after reading John 9. Jesus said that the reason the man was born blind was \"so that the works of God may be revealed through Him.\" I truly believed that God would heal me so I could be a great testimony of His Awesome Power. Later on I was given the wisdom to understand that if we pray for something, if it's God's will, it'll happen in His time. If it's not God's will for it to happen, then I know that He has something better. I now see that Glory revealed as He is using me just the way I am and in ways others can't be used. I am now twenty-three years old and have completed a Bachelor of Commerce majoring in Financial Planning and Accounting. I am also a motivational speaker and love to go out and share my story and testimony wherever opportunities become available. I have developed talks to relate to and encourage students through topics that challenge today's teenagers. I am also a speaker in the corporate sector. I have a passion for reaching out to youth and keep myself available for whatever God wants me to do, and wherever He leads, I follow. I have many dreams and goals that I have set to achieve in my life. I want to become the best witness I can be of God's Love and Hope , to become an international inspirational speaker and be used as a vessel in both Christian and non-Christian venues. I want to become financially independent by the age of 25, through real estate investments, to modify a car for me to drive and to be interviewed and share my story on the \" Oprah Winfrey Show \"! Writing several best-selling books has been one of my dreams and I hope to finish writing my first by the end of the year. It will be called \"No Arms, No Legs, No Worries!\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      I believe that if you have the desire and passion to do something, and if it's God's will, you will achieve it in good time. As humans, we continually put limits on our selves for no reason at all! What's worse is putting limits on God who can do all things. We put God in a \"box\". The awesome thing about the Power of God, is that if we want to do something for God, instead of focusing on our capability, concentrate on our availability for we know that it is God through us and we can't do anything without Him. Once we make ourselves available for God's work, guess whose capabilities we rely on? God's!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       May the Lord Bless you\nIn Christ,\nNick Vujicic  \"Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be UNDERSTOOD\"\n Origins:   Research in progress.

        "justification": "On Feb. 3, 2021, a tweet by @ialhusseini appeared to share heartwarming news about nine parents who were deported during former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. The tweet claimed the adults had landed back in the U.S. the same day the tweet was posted and had been reunited with their children: tweet   However, the photograph used in this tweet was miscaptioned. It's true that nine parents who were deported from the U.S. were later reunited with their children, but that occurrence took place a year before the tweet shown above was posted. Pictured in the Feb. 3, 2021, tweet were David Xol and his son, Byron. The Associated Press had reported their story in a Jan. 23, 2020, article headlined \"9 parents separated from families return to children in US,\" along with the photograph shown in the tweet.  The picture was credited to Ringo HW Chiu/AP, and its original caption read: \"David Xol-Cholom, of Guatemala, hugs his son Byron at Los Angeles international airport as they reunite after being separated by the Trump administration.\" reported Both Xol and his son were featured in that AP story: \nLOS ANGELES (AP)  As his long-lost son walked toward him in an airport terminal, a sobbing David Xol stretched out his arms, fell to one knee, and embraced the boy for about three minutes, crying into his shoulder. He had not held the child since May 2018, when border agents pulled then-7-year-old Byron away inside a detention facility. They were separated under President Donald Trumps zero-tolerance policy  the father deported to Guatemala, the son placed in a series of government facilities before ending up with a host family in Texas. Xol was one of nine parents who won the exceedingly rare chance to return to the U.S. after being deported under family separation. They arrived Wednesday at Los Angeles International Airport to be reunited with children they hadnt seen in a year and a half or longer under the order of a federal judge who found the U.S. government had unlawfully prevented them from seeking asylum. A video was also included with the AP story showing the moment that Xol and his son embraced for the first time in more than a year and a half: https://youtu.be/r_QFc8bIIww\n      The tweet from @ialhusseini received thousands of retweets and likes, with one viewing replying,  \"Grateful for the Biden Administration for this beautiful pix.\" Others thanked both U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden. However, these families were reunited a year before Biden was sworn in as president. After taking office on Jan. 20, 2021, Biden did move forward on plans to reunite children who were deported and separated from their parents under the Trump administration. On Feb. 2, 2021, The Associated Press reported that the wheels for those unifications were in motion: reported Alejandro Mayorkas, who was sworn in as Homeland Security secretary after his nomination was confirmed by the Senate, will lead a task force on family separation, focused largely on reuniting parents and children who remain apart. It is unclear exactly how many, but about 5,500 children have been identified in court documents as having been separated during Trump's presidency, including about 600 whose parents have yet to be found by a court-appointed committee. \"We're going to work to undo the moral and national shame of the previous administration,\" Biden said. The review will address the possibility of legal status in the United States for separated families and providing mental health services. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sued to reunite families, has asked the administration for legal status in the United States for all of the thousands of families that have been separated, as well as financial compensation for those families and attorneys at government expense. In sum, a tweet from Feb. 3, 2021, reported a news story as if it had just taken place. However, although the story was true, it was a report from more than a year earlier. Twitter users shared the tweet and its accompanying picture as if it were new and current, and for this reason we have rated this story as being \"Miscaptioned.\" Featured photograph caption (top): \"A Honduran asylum seeker, recently released from federal detention with fellow migrants, holds the hand of her six-year-old daughter at a bus depot on June 11, 2019, in McAllen, Texas.\"",

        "justification": " Claim:  A hearing-impaired student at Tioga Hills Elementary School was physically disciplined by a teacher and sustained a dislocated shoulder as a result. UNDETERMINED Example:  [Collected via Facebook, April 2015] \n\n\n  \n\nPLEASE SHARE! I would like to ask my friends to please share and support us at this time. I am not going to stand silent anymore. On Tuesday, March 17th, my son, Tommy suffered an attack on him by his math teacher, Mrs. Joan Barr Pokorak at Tioga Hills Elementary School in the Vestal School District. As many of you know, my 10 year old, fourth grade son, Tommy has been through many ear surgeries over the past years, resulting in a significant hearing loss in his left ear. He has a 504 Plan in place at school due to his disability. The plan specifies that he have preferential seating in the front of the room with his right ear, his \"good\" ear towards the teacher. This plan has been in place over 2 years. It came to our attention that during this math teacher's class, Tommy is seated near the back of the classroom with his impaired ear in the direction of the math teacher. During CSE meetings the hearing specialist from the school noted that Tom cannot hear in this position. Tommy and students in the classroom testify that on Tuesday, March 17th Mrs. Pokorak was working on a math problem at the front of the room and hesitating with an answer. Tommy blurted out, \"the answer is..\" giving the answer out of turn. From what students have testified, Mrs. Pokorak screamed, \"GET OUT!!!!\"   Tommy said he was startled and wasn't sure if she was talking to him. She came directly behind him, dragged and lifted him up from his chair, pulled him by his right arm to the door and pushed him out into the hallway with both hands while screaming, \"GET OUT!!!\" She then slammed the door, causing the teacher from the next door classroom to come out into the hallway to see what was going on. Parents reported to me, that students still in the classroom sat there stunned. My son was hurting, shocked, and terrified what just happened to him. When Tommy came home that day, I checked with parents of students in the class to see what they would say happened. They all told the same scenario that Tom relayed of the events. Tommy complained of shoulder pain and his shoulder was making very loud popping sounds. Concerned that the teacher had injured his shoulder, I took him to Lourdes Hospital Emergency Room. X-rays and the Dr. confirmed that due to the attack on Tommy from this teacher, he suffered a third degree separation (Closed dislocation) of his Acromioclavicular Joint with significant scapular winging. At that time the hospital social worker said as a mandated reporter she must call Child Protective Services for an investigation of the case. Our family was devastated. Expecting to hear from Vestal School District regarding their concern for Tom's health and well being we waited and waited thinking we would be contacted by someone from the district. Up to this point, no explanation or even acknowledgement of the incident has been made on the part of the school. The State Police investigator has informed us that the school district has blocked him from contacting individuals, students, and has retained legal counsel for Mrs. Pokarak.  Again, to this day she refuses to speak to the investigator regarding her brutal attack on my son. Now, the Tioga County District Attorney, Eric Gartenman, is refusing to speak with our attorney regarding this incident. We are left confused and without resolution or answers as to why. When speaking with the investigating officer, he stated that Mr. Gartenman felt that Mrs. Pokarak was justified in injuring my son due to his \"talking in class.\" The investigator stated that Tommy wasn't out of control, disrespectful to the teacher or others..he was \"talking.\" When we explained that he MUST be seated toward the front of the room with his good ear facing the teacher (according to his 504 plan) Tommy said he truly didn't hear the teacher from where he was placed in the classroom if she had asked him to be quiet. Why couldn't she ask him to leave the class, why the brutal attack that resulted in a dislocation? What kind of force and anger causes this action and injury? Why is this okay? And WHY are there so many questions left unanswered?!  My son is now experiencing both physical and emotional trauma due to this assault. He is afraid to be in school, afraid of another attack. If not on my son..who will be next? Our elected officials are doing NOTHING!! So, when you think your kids are safe at school, think again. It is with a heavy heart that I post this and ask for support, because I am a teacher and can't even imagine EVER harming one of my students. Please, please help us get the word out regarding this cover up by Vestal School District and Eric Gartenman and ask for justice on behalf of my son. Keep all of our children safe. Please \"Share\" in hopes we migh get some help and resolution and prevent this from happening to someone else's child. Thank you so much- Sharon and Frank Russo.

According to Ms. Russo's account, her fourth-grade son has a significant hearing loss in one ear and is therefore typically seated in classrooms towards the front of the room with his \"good\" ear positioned towards the teacher in order to help compensate for his hearing loss. For some reason Tommy was seated in a disadvantageous position in his math class, and when he supposedly blurted out something like \"c'mon, the answer is ...\" in reference to a math problem the teacher was attempting to work out on in front of the room, the teacher yelled at him to \"GET OUT\" of the classroom. When Tommy failed to respond to this command (because his hearing issue made him unsure whether it was addressed to him), the teacher physically dragged him out of his seat, pushed and pulled him out the classroom door and into the hallway, and slammed the door behind him, screaming at him and dislocating his shoulder in the process. posted The New York State Police Child Abuse hotline was contacted a day after the alleged incident, and in April 2015 state police reported they had completed an investigation into the allegations and that a decision on whether to pursue criminal charges (two possible misdemeanor charges) rested in the hands of the Tioga County District Attorney. On 6 April 2015 Ms. Russo posted again about the incident to her Facebook page, indicating that the district attorney's office had opened a case about the matter: posted \n\nI spoke with my attorney, Mr. Ronald Benjamin. He told me that he has been in contact with Mr. Gartenman (1st Assistant DA for Tioga Co.) and the case has been opened. He expressed that as soon as the big trial Tioga Co. is dealing with now is over, they will be dealing with the CPS investigation from the NY State Police regarding Mrs. P.\nMr. Benjamin also said he would speak to media regarding the case and they should contact him should they wish.  As for the teacher, Mrs. P- She is still at Tioga Hills Elementary as of today.\n\n However, on 7 April 2015 Vestal Central School District Superintendent Mark LaRoach sent a letter to parents of students at Tioga Hills Elementary stating that the District Attorney's office had determined the accusations were unfounded and the teacher had been exonerated. letter Nonetheless, the Russos' attorney said they had filed an action against the school district that would \"mature into a lawsuit in the next couple of months.\" Last updated:  9 April 2015\n ",

        "justification": "[Collected via e-mail, 2003] After anthropologist Susan McKinley came back home from an expedition in South America, she noticed a very strange rash on her left breast. Nobody knew what it was and she quickly dismissed it believing that the sores would leave in time. Upon her return she decided to see a doctor after she started developing intense pains. The doctor, not knowing the exact severity of the case, gave her antibiotics and special creams. As time elapsed the pain did not subside and her left breast became more inflamed and started to bleed. She decided to bandage her sores however as Susan's pain grew more intense she decided to seek help from a more certified doctor. Dr. Lynch could not diagnose the infection and told Susan to seek the aid of one of his colleagues who specialized in dermatology whom was sadly on vacation. She waited for two weeks and finally was able to reach the dermatologist. Sadly, a life changing event was about to unfold during her appointment.  To Miss McKinley's surprise, after she removed the bandages, they found larva growing and squirming within the pores and sores of her breast. Sometimes these wicked creatures would all together simultaneously move around into different crevices. What she didn't know was that the holes were in fact, deeper than she had originally thought for these larvae were feeding off the fat, tissue, and even milk canals of her bosom. The holes were 5 cm deep. She was operated on and the larva was removed from her breast. Therefore always take a slight rash serious and have the eggs removed before it is to late. Cheers and may the creatures leave you in peace. [Collected via e-mail, 2005] Read the article first before looking at the picture and film. This looks horrible. Oh my God!!!!!!! Ladies this could happen to you and Guys this could happen to your wife, girlfriend, partner so please BEWARE,and also warn others. (see the 2 files attached) It has been reported that this is happening in Zimbabwe as well, please make sure you iron your undergarments before you wear them and make sure that your clothes are ironed when they are dry and not damp. The picture is horrible but I felt that I should share with you. [Collected via e-mail, 2006] ALL, PLEASE WASH ALL BRAS, UNDERWEAR WHEN YOU BUY BEFORE WEARING THEM. WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT PARASITE IS IN OUR CLOTHES WHEN WE BUY THEM. FORWARD TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW. LET ME FORE WARN YOU THIS IS SO SQUIMISH, I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING IS CRAWLING ALL OVER ME EVEN AS I SEND THIS TO YOU. BE AWARE. IT IS SO GROTESQUE.PLEASE WASH YOUR UNDERWEAR BEFORE WEARING. PREFERABLY IN BOILING HOT WATER. This is not for the weak, I have never seen anything like this. Read the article first before looking at the picture and film. This looks horrible. Oh my God!!!!!!! [Collected via e-mail, March 2007] YOU MUST READ BELOW BEFORE OPENING THE PICTURES. SHARE THIS WITH, DAUGHTERS, SISTERS, FRIENDS...ANY WOMAN My brother was recently telling me of a news story he heard regarding a flesh-eating bacteria found in new clothing shipments to the USA. These are the first pictures I have seen regarding that very subject. After seeing the attached photos, I understand the gravity of what he was telling me. This is something that is a very real and very serious concern as you will see. Ladies / gentelmens please make it a habit from this point forward to wash your just purchased undergarments before wearing them.Or spinning them in the dryer. This is sensitive. Please share with as many women and men that you know. Our undergarments are made in different parts of the country, sit in boxes and go through many hands and exchanges before we purchase\nthem for ourselves. TO ALL , PLEASE WASH ALL BRAS, UNDERWEAR ( ALL CLOTHING ) WHEN YOU BUY BEFORE WEARING THEM. YOU CAN THROW THEN IN THE DRYER FOR A QUICK SPIN TO KILL THE PARASITES TOO !! WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT PARASITE IS IN OUR CLOTHES WHEN WE BUY THEM. FORWARD TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW. The attached photos are not for the weak hearted. This item is another example of a common online phenomenon: Someone makes an image available, the picture begins to circulate through sharing, the original attribution or explanation for the image gets lost along the way (or was never provided), people begin to make up stories to explain the origin of the now-sourceless picture, and those fabricated explanations become attached to the image as it continues to circulate. We've seen this phenomenon before in the maggot photographs (disturbing image warning), only in this case it isn't just the explanation that's fabricated; the image is a phony one created through digital manipulation as well. maggot This image appeared on the internet back in June 2003 (on a web site with a collection of other manipulated photographs); at that time it carried no explanation at all and was soon attributed by others to some new type of \"body modification.\" Not until a couple of months later did it pick up the story about an anthropologist named \"Susan McKinley\" who returned from a South American expedition to notice a \"very strange rash\" on her breast caused by \"larvae\" which were \"feeding off the fat, tissue, and even milk canals of her bosom.\" No known medical condition causes a result like the one depicted here, and the breast tissue around the supposed \"larvae infestation\" (larvae of what?) is too healthy (no redness, inflammation, or necrosis) to be believable. This image appears to be the product of the melding of a photograph of a woman's breast and a picture of something similar to a lotus seed pod:   In 2005 someone combined the picture and text quoted in the example above with an existing video clip that seemingly showed maggot-like creatures being removed by forceps from a woman's infected breast, and in November 2005 we began seeing versions that claimed the patient had developed her condition due to the flooding of New Orleans caused by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005:  My aunt, Head Nurse at Tulane Memorial hospital in New Orleans Louisiana sent me this email. The attached video is that of a female patient who, due to the flooding of her home wore the same clothes for days. The contamination in the water was so bad she first broke out with a rash on her breast and then she had a lump on her breast and she popped it and puss excreted from the lump. After treating it herself for days she finally went to seek medical attention and when she did they found\nserious infection! They later sedated the patient and found that these insects were within the fatty tissues of her breast and within the milk producing glands (sorry not a TRUE medic), she is also 3 months pregnant! And to think, we though Rita was bad on us! If you pay attention you can see them moving in and out, gross, but one of the issues they are now dealing with in New Orleans with patients. The referenced clip was a genuine video, but it had no connection to Hurricane Katrina. It showed the treatment of a Nigerian patient with breast lesions and multiple sinuses containing Tumbu fly larvae. (Fourteen separate larvae were eventually extracted from the breast.) The authors of a 2004 medical journal article on the case noted at the time that only \"one case has been reported in the English literature.\" article In 2006, someone combined the following text with a series of photographs of patients experiencing what look like severe rashes, infections, and necrosis of the upper chest and breasts. The specific origins of these photos are unknown to us, but they likely depict the advanced stages of breast cancer.

            "Online conspiracy theorists claim Snapchat's image filter feature called \"Lenses\" is covertly amassing a database of users' faces to share with law enforcement agencies."
        ],
        "justification": "One of the more whimsical messaging options offered by Snapchat  a social media app for mobile devices introduced in 2011  is the ability to personalize selfies in real time and share them instantly with other users, a feature that has at once contributed to the app's immense popularity (Snapchat boasts an estimated 166 million users daily) and raised privacy concerns among some of its customers.  Snapchat's rotating toolbox of image filters, called Lenses, enables users to manipulate photos and videos to humorous effect, as seen in these examples shared publicly on Instagram by celebrity Snapchatter Chrissy Teigen:   Cute and innocent though it may appear, the feature has become the target of conspiracy theorists claiming that Snapchat's corporate owner, Snap Inc., uses it to collect facial recognition data which it allegedly stores and shares with law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and CIA. We've found examples of such rumors dating back to Fall 2015 (soon after the Lenses feature was officially rolled out): you guys are all swooning over the snapchat filters... And The FBI is getting the most extensive facial recognition library ever  TEENWOLF (@TEENWOLFREMIX) October 3, 2015 October 3, 2015  It wasn't until April of the following year that the rumors reached takeoff speed, however, thanks largely to a tweet composed by hip hop artist, songwriter, and unabashed flat-earth theorist B.o.B to his roughly two million followers: tweet flat-earth when you realize all the snap chat filters are really building a facial recognition database ?  B.o.B (@bobatl) April 16, 2016 April 16, 2016 \nIn May 2016, with civil cases already pending against Facebook and Google alleging unauthorized use of facial recognition technology, a class action lawsuit was filed by two Snapchat users in Illinois complaining that the app violated their rights under the state's Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by failing to obtain adequate permission before gathering and storing their \"biometric identifiers and biometric information\". lawsuit BIPA The company flatly denied it: denied Contrary to the claims of this frivolous lawsuit, we are very careful not to collect, store, or obtain any biometric information or identifiers about our community. The class action suit was eventually dismissed in favor of arbitration in September 2016, but as of this writing the case remains unresolved. Crucial to Snapchat's defense is their position, as stated in the Privacy Center of the company's web site, that the app relies on object recognition, not facial recognition, to make Lenses work: arbitration stated Have you ever wondered how Lenses make your eyes well up with tears or rainbows come out your mouth? Some of the magic behind Lenses is object recognition. Object recognition is an algorithm designed to understand the general nature of things that appear in an image. It lets us know that a nose is a nose or an eye is an eye. But object recognition isnt the same as facial recognition. While Lenses can recognize faces in general, they can't recognize a specific face. If it's true that Lenses can't recognize (i.e., identify) specific faces, then the claim that the app produces anything qualifying as a \"biometric identifier\" under Illinois law is seriously in doubt. (The district judge in Illinois overseeing the Google facial recognition case previously defined \"biometric identifier\" as \"a set of biology-based measurements ... used to identify a person.) case As to the wider claim that Snapchat is building a \"facial recognition database,\" the distinction between object and facial recognition, at minimum, places a burden of proof on those trumpeting the claim to show that the app is capable of identifying specific faces in the first place. If this explanation (provided by the web site Vox) of how the software works is accurate, Snapchat doesn't need to be able to identify specific faces to accomplish the task. It has to recognize a face as a face, and identify the parts of a face as the nose, eyes, ears, chin, etc., but it doesn't have to recognize who the face belongs to: this \nMoreover, Snapchat's Privacy Policy states that the company neither collects nor permanently stores user-created content (meaning photos and videos) let alone preserves such items in a database: states Snapchat lets you capture what its like to live in the moment. On our end, that means that we automatically delete the content of your Snaps (the photo and video messages that you send your friends) from our servers after we detect that a Snap has been opened by all recipients or has expired. And although the policy further acknowledges that Snap Inc. may share users' personal information \"to comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation\" (and transparency reports show that the company has indeed complied with such requests in the past), they can't grant the FBI (or any other agency) access to a \"facial recognition database\" that doesn't exist. reports Some rumors die hard, however. An updated variant that cropped up in early 2017 brought two new claims to the mix: one, that the FBI literally created Snapchat's image filtering software (and alleged facial recognition database); and two, that there is a smoking gun to prove it  namely U.S. patent #9396354:   granted According to an analysis by Sophos' Naked Security blogger Alison Booth, the patent proposes using facial recognition software to identify individual subjects in photos, whereupon the latter would be modified and/or their distribution restricted in accordance with the subjects' pre-established privacy settings. analysis There is a catch. Implementation of the process would, of course, require amassing a facial recognition database. \"For facial recognition to work,\" writes Booth, \"Snapchat would need to store images of all users that sign up to the feature  as a reference image to compare photos against.\" So, there it is  a \"facial recognition database\" of the sort conspiracy theorists have been going on about since 2015, except that Snapchat has not, to date, implemented such a feature (a fact we were able to confirm with the company), nor is there evidence that the FBI (or any other law enforcement agency) was involved in creating it, nor does the patent itself mention sharing facial recognition data with government entities. Despite finding no legitimate basis for the claim that Snapchat is currently engaged in collecting, storing, or sharing facial recognition data on its users, we do not wish to downplay the increasing prevalence of facial recognition technology in both commercial and government applications, nor the privacy issues this raises. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minnesota) articulated some of these issues in a statement announcing the release of a 2015 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the privacy implications of the technology: report The newly released report raises serious concerns about how companies are collecting, using, and storing our most sensitive personal information. I believe that all Americans have a fundamental right to privacy, which is why it's important that, at the very least, the tech industry adopts strong, industry-wide standards for facial recognition technology. But what we really need are federal standards that address facial recognition privacy by enhancing our consumer privacy framework. The tech industry has yet to address these concerns to the satisfaction of consumer privacy watchdogs, however, nor has Congress made progress toward establishing the federal standards Franken called for. Thus far, issue has been dealt with primarily in the court system via cases such as the aforementioned BIPA class action lawsuits against Facebook and Google. watchdogs lawsuits One of the ironies of the false alarms about Snapchat's alleged sharing of facial recognition data with the FBI is that the agency already maintains a biometric data network comprising the facial images of more than 117 million Americans (about half the U.S. adult population, and growing), mostly drawn from state DMV databases and other non-criminal sources. A 2016 report by the Georgetown Law Center for Privacy and Technology warned that the technology is both error-prone, with a disproportionate impact on communities of color, and almost totally unregulated. already report disproportionate In testimony before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing chaired by Sen. Franken in 2012, Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Jennifer Lynch urged Congress to act sooner rather than later to protect the biometric privacy of all Americans: testimony Face recognition and its accompanying privacy concerns are not going away. Given this, it is imperative that government act now to limit unnecessary biometrics collection; instill proper protections on data collection, transfer, and search; ensure accountability; mandate independent oversight; require appropriate legal process before government collection; and define clear rules for data sharing at all levels. This is important to preserve the democratic and constitutional values that are bedrock to American society.

            "A viral image purportedly depicts a deep-fried rat head served to a customer at a Harlem-area Popeyes Chicken outlet, but others suspect it's merely organ meat."
        ],
        "justification": "On 18 September 2016, Facebook user Rosemary Thomas shared a four-panel image of what she claimed was a breaded and deep-fried rat served to her at a Harlem-area Popeyes Chicken: shared claimed Friends and family, this is a meal Popeyes in Harlem served my daughter, my niece and sister. This is clearly a rat and they have the nerve to have a 5 rating by the department of health. I've sent this picture to DESK@NY1 and no one has contacted me. People please free to share this picture. Think about all the other rat that have been served and the lasting effect this will have on my daughter, niece and sister. The exact address is 2730 Frederick Douglas Blvd.  The claim was shared over a hundred thousand times, and social media users flooded Popeyes Chicken's Facebook page to express their disgust about the images. Some social media users perhaps recognized Thomas' claim as an iteration of a very old urban legend known as the \"Kentucky Fried Rat\": Facebook Kentucky Fried Rat The \"Kentucky Fried Rat\" tale is one of the hoariest of food contamination urban legends, and some elements of its spread are easy to explain. Within the context of fast food restaurants, the offending eatery has to be a fried chicken outlet in order for the rat to be suitably disguised as a piece of food. Once the restaurant is established as one that serves fast-food chicken, it becomes Kentucky Fried Chicken because, as folklorist Gary Alan Fine writes, \"The frequency of attachment of an urban legend to the largest company or corporation is so common as to be considered a law of urban folklore.\" (These days, however, many KFC outlets receive their chicken pieces pre-battered, and thus one of them could not \"accidentally\" batter and fry a rat.) The choice of a rat as a contaminant is also easy: rats have turned up in food products before; they're the right size and shape to be mistaken for pieces of chicken (especially when fried in batter); and rats are vermin, symbols of filth and decay. The fact that the rat-chicken is usually eaten in the dark is a plot device to prevent premature discovery of the \"secret,\" although some might consider it an important symbolic aspect of the legend. So, what does this legend have to say? As our society becomes more urbanized (and frenetic), we become less and less involved with the preparation of our own food, frequently dining out instead of eating at home, scarfing a quick meal rather than enjoying a leisurely one, and leaving the food preparation entirely in the hands of others. And these others are not local restaurateurs we know well, but anonymous corporate fast food franchisees and their faceless employees. The combination of our guilt at abdicating this responsibility and our mistrust of corporations is expressed as fear that fast food entities who don't care about us will serve us tainted food prepared under unsanitary conditions, due to carelessness, laziness, or sheer malice. Like many other long-circulating urban legends, iterations (and parodies) of the deep-fried rat (or mouse) claim pop up from time to time on social media as first-person accounts. Typically, those claims are determined to be misunderstandings or fraudulent attempts to extort money from large companies. iterations parodies misunderstandings We contacted Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, and spokeswoman Renee Kopkowski told us the customer originally arranged to meet with someone from Popeyes on 19 September 2016 to supply a sample of the item in question for testing but then postponed the meeting, so the company has not yet been able to submit the sample to third-party examination. Kopkowski also stated that Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen conferred with suppliers who suggested the depicted material was actually organ meat, and she added that New York City's Health Department subsequently performed a thorough investigation of the Harlem location and found no evidence of the presence of vermin (i.e., rats): \nA guest at a Popeyes in Harlem in New York City recently posted on her social media account saying she thought she found something unusual in her chicken. Everyone at Popeyes takes claims like this very seriously.  Food quality is our top priority. When the franchise owner of this restaurant learned of the guests post, he immediately tried contacting her to resolve the issue.  The pictures she posted were also sent to the poultry supplier and the owner contacted the health department to inspect his restaurant that day.   The health department re-confirmed the locations A rating.  Its important to understand Popeyes uses fresh poultry.  Its rare, but there are instances when chicken organs fail to be removed from the final product.  While they may look unpleasant, or sometimes look like non-chicken parts, they do not pose a health risk. The franchisee has requested that the guest in New York and the attorney she is working with turn over the product to have the product tested by an independent third party. Until that testing takes place, we cant confirm her claim is valid\n ",

            "A social media rumor that suggests painting blue strips on curbs to support police is well-meaning but not very practical."
        ],
        "justification": "FACT CHECK Do blue lines painted on curbs signify a residence where a police officer can reliably find \"back-up\"?  Claim: Blue lines painted on curbs signify a residence where a police officer can reliably find \"back-up.\"   MIXTURE Example:  [Collected via Facebook, September 2015] The Safe Harbor Initiative: To all law enforcement who see this line, know that the residents of this home appreciate your service and dedication to keeping the peace. Know that when you enter the neighborhood and see these lines that you are not alone or without \"back-up\". We do not need the media to make our voices of support for our police and emergency services heard (though it would be nice). Lastly, if you are in my neighborhood and mean to harm a member of law enforcement, know that decision may be hazardous to you health as someone has that officers back! Please share. Origins:  The period 2014-15 saw an ongoing public debate in the United States about police and policing: one faction held that corruption among law enforcement was rife and the cause of unnecessary civilian deaths at the hands of police, while another held that Americans were increasingly at war with cops and unappreciative of their difficult jobs and their sacrifices. (Social media rumors about rudeness to police often seem to quickly follow high profile controversies involving police and race, such as the death of Eric Garner or the McKinney  pool party incident.) civilian deaths war rudeness follow Eric Garner McKinney incident One thread of that debate suggested that the focus of reactive movements such as \"Black Lives Matter\" was essentially attacking police. In response, on 9 September 2015 Facebook user Anthony Welichko posted the example shown above, proposing an idea to support police that he dubbed the \"Safe Harbor Initiative.\" (The idea later carried over to a number of September 2015 blog posts titled \"Have You Seen Blue Strip on Curb? Heres The INCREDIBLE Reason Behind It.\") Black Lives Matter police posted The \"Safe Harbor\" proposal is clearly well-intentioned, and the person who asked social media users to share it meant only to encourage a broadly adoptable method of showing support for police officers. However, its functional application is somewhat unsound and ill-suited for the purpose it's supposed to serve. One issue with this proposal is that curb markers are often used by agencies such as public works departments to indicate locations work sites or important structural information. One example comes from Bozeman,  Montana, where the very same signal illustrated in the \"Safe Harbor\" proposal was already in use: Bozeman, Water operators are locating, operating, adjusting grade if needed and updating location maps. They will paint the top of the box blue and put a blue strip on the curb adjacent to the street so that it is easier to find for any future work such as getting a Global Positioning System point for it. Bozeman is presumably not the only location wherein public works officials utilize painted strips of blue on curbs as internal signals.  Adopting that system to show moral support for police would create confusion over whether such markings were related to law enforcement protection or infrastructural projects. Additionally, blue strips painted on curbs are not particularly visible during non-daylight hours.  It's not reasonable to expect that police responding to evening or nighttime calls will first examine neighborhood curbsides with their flashlights to determine whether they have any community support in the area. Another matter is whether or not the proposal is (or ever will be) known outside of a few thousand shares on Facebook.  Unless and until it is a widely used (or at least widely recognized) system, it will not be  recognizable or useful to police. Finally, any form of reliance on such an informal and unofficial system is fraught with peril.  Would a person who was hostile to police likely have any compunctions about painting a marking on his curb in order to mislead cops into a false (and potentially tragic) sense of security?  If not, it's unlikely that police would ever gain much benefit or place any reliance on the use of such symbols. Aside from all of those issues, just how are civilians supposed to provide \"back-up\" or \"have [an officer's back]\" during a hypothetical adversarial event or crime in progress? Police everywhere (while typically grateful for public support) are pretty firm about urging well-meaning civilians not to  interfere with law enforcement activities. Routinely, cops emphatically request that civilians present at crime scenes assist merely by staying out of the way and closely following their instructions, not by leaping in to serve as untrained \"back-up.\" interfere instructions Police departments across the United States (examples here, here, here, here, here, and here [PDF, PDF]) are consistent and firm in their guidance on this matter: civilians should not intervene with crimes in progress, especially when police are already on the scene.  Those who do may end up injured (potentially fatally), and untrained intervention poses severe risk to both other civilians and responding officers. This reason alone is enough to be extremely cautious about spreading the \"blue strip\" rumor, as the police require cooperation with the commands they've issued to bystanders more than they need encouragement for the public to act as crime scene cheerleaders. here here here here here here PDF PDF While the \"Safe Harbor Initiative\"/blue strip curb paint idea was one borne of a desire to show support for police, for many reasons the proposed practice is likely to be of negligible benefit to any officers.  Most important, the message encourages a practice police departments universally disdain: civilian intervention in crimes in progress. Well-meaning, untrained civilians who've taken it upon themselves to \"help\" the police are generally more of a burden and hindrance than anything else, so if you think police might need your help during an event, it's best to wait for them to ask you for assistance. It's understandable that folks are moved to give back to hard-working police officers across the country, and one Quora user (who is also a retired cop) offered a list of safe ways  for civilians to do so without interfering with police activity: ways   1) Obey the law. Don't be someone the cops have to be concerned about. 2) Avoid being a victim. Lock your car, lock your house, don't take needless risks or act recklessly. 3) Be vigilant. Get to know your neighbors, and become aware of what is normal and typical, and what isn't. When you see something that \"Just Don't Look Right\" and may be indicative of a crime, inquire if you can do so safely and without undue risk, and/or call the police. 4)  See if your local law enforcement agency has any volunteer programs you can participate in. These vary from being a reserve police officer (requires considerable commitment) to helping with clerical duties at the police station. There may not be anything available that appeals to you, but it doesn't hurt to ask. If nothing else, ask, \"How can I help you do your jobs?\" Every community has its special needs. 5) If you become aware of information that could help to solve a crime, pick up the phone. Sometimes tips like these provide valuable investigative leads, sometimes not. 100% of the information the police don't hear about is useless. 6) If you're a parent, be a good one. Teach your children that life is full of choices and choices have consequences. Know where your kids are and have some idea of what they are up to.   \"Slacktivist\" initiatives such as painting blue strips on curbs may give a temporary feeling of accomplishment, but those truly concerned with the plight of police officers would do better to donate to law enforcement charities or volunteer in an official capacity where civilian hands are needed (and wanted).

The collection was still in Frances' possession Thursday when Hardcastle heard Harold's motion to get his share of the litter. \"I'd just had enough,\" said Hardcastle, who has been a Family Court judge for seven years. \"We spend a lot of time dealing with some simply unreasonable issues.

            "Rumors that criminals are marking homes with colored stickers or bags in trees in order to steal dogs for use in dogfighting events are unfounded."
        ],
        "justification": "Warnings about dog-snatchers tagging homes with colored stickers to facilitate the stealing of canines for use in dogfighting events were originally circulated in the suburbs of Perth, Australia, in February 2013 before being relocated to a UK setting the following month: Any dog owners beware, leaflet droppers or anyone walking around housing estates.\nKeep your eye out for small coloured STICKERS on gates or doors, gangs are marking how many dogs live there to steal and they are using them for DOG BAIT FOR FIGHTING.\nRing the police immediately if you see any and inform the home owners.\nRemove the stickers immediately!\nRed stickers are for big dogs\nYellow for medium and\nPink for small breeds\nPlease re-share and keep your dog safe!\nThis is already happening in the Goole Yorkshire area, UK and could be spreading across the country. This is disgusting The same rumor has also been spread involving plastic bags in trees: I've seen on Facebook that people's homes are being marked by plastic bags tied in trees indicating they have a dog. This is a sign for criminals to abduct the dog for it be used as bait in dog fighting rings. This just doesn't seem feasible.  Officials in the former area quickly got out the word that this warning was a hoax: The internet has been flooded with chilling tales of an organised underground dog fighting ring operating out of Perth's suburbs. Family pets have been systematically stolen from their yards to be trained as fighting dogs, according to reports appearing on social media and online classified websites. While many in Perth claim to know somebody who knows somebody whose pet has fallen prey to a kidnapping, authorities and social media experts have dismissed the warnings as a viral hoax. Animal welfare authorities in Perth, who have been inundated with phone calls since the messages started to appear, said the warnings were \"completely unfounded.\" \"It's a viral hoax,\" RSPCA spokesman Tim Mayne told Fairfax Media. \"Police and the RSPCA have no solid evidence on this at all. \"We've been monitoring this situation and still, to the best of our knowledge, it's a viral hoax.\" Curtin University internet studies lecturer and social media expert Tama Leaver said the lack of specific details in the messages was a dead giveaway for a viral hoax. \"If people were really trying to stop something there would be specific details about it and who they could contact,\" he said. He said the messages were so vague they had managed to cover \"the entire spectrum of Perth\". \"If something like that is appearing for two weeks and there's no official information released whatsoever  there's no police follow up  and there's no evidence of an actual fight, you'd have to question it,\" he said. Similarly, in March 2013 UK officials in Yorkshire issued a denial that area dognappers were placing stickers or other markings on vehicle tires to identify the homes of dog owners (a variant of a similar rumor that such a method was being used to target gun owners): denial rumor Police in Whitby and other areas of the county want to reassure residents that there are no gangs of dog thieves operating in the area and placing stickers on vehicles. A local officer who was called by concerned residents, has enlisted the advice of a local tyre fitter to prove that marks left on vehicle tyres are not the work of dog-nappers. Rumours have been circulating on social media sites that dog thieves have been placing stickers on vehicle tyres to mark the homes of dog owners, ready for them to go back and steal the dogs. This is not the case. The red and yellow dots seen on tyres are placed there by tyre manufacturers. The red dot denotes the heaviest part of the tyre and a yellow dot denotes the lightest. They are not the work of dog thieves. The rumor traveled to the U.S. in early 2015, when it emerged in the form of a warning involving plastic bags tied to trees as a harbinger of dognappers. According to the rumor (which spread widely on Facebook), criminals marked dog-owning homes by tying grocery bags to trees so pets could later be kidnapped for dogfighting rings. There was no explanation of how those who became wise to the purported ruse managed to differentiate bags purposefully tied to trees for signaling from discarded grocery bags that coincidentally came to rest among the branches after being blown about by wind. And as with prior variations, no instances in which pets were abducted were linked to plastic bags mysteriously found in trees prior to the canines' disappearances. As noted in our article about a similar putative home-marking scheme, there's no practical reason for persons seeking to perpetrate crimes against property to surreptitiously mark the homes of their intended victims rather than simply recording the addresses of those homes. A related warning was originally circulated in March 2012 (and again in March 2013) about a man named Michael Anthony Burdis who was reportedly attempting to obtain dogs from animal shelters to \"use as bait in dog fighting\": article This is Michael Anthony Burdis  watch out for him in all rescue centres as he's trying to get his hands on a dog to use as bait in dog fighting! Please share this far and wide  we have to stop this evil man! This warning was apparently based on information originating with the UK-based Scruples Whippet Rescue, who posted on their Facebook page back in March 2012 that: Facebook There is currently a statement being posted all over facebook about a Michael Burdis. It is claimed that the statement was written by Scruples Whippet Rescue and is badly written and reads like Michael is a volunteer for us. The statement was NOT written by any member of the Scruples team. Michael Burdis is NOT in any way a Volunteer for Scruples or in any way associated with our Rescue. He wrote on our Facebook page last week enquiring about young dogs and was REFUSED a dog and was BLOCKED from our page due to his dog fighting links. This man is currently under investigation by the RSPCA . All our Volunteers are very strictly vetted and home checked and Scruples Whippet Rescue will not have, and never have had anything to do with anyone involved in the barbaric illegal activity that is dog fighting. We are very concerned that this badly worded statement that has been written by someone unknown to Scruples is making people believe that we are involved with Michael and his activities and we are asking all Facebook groups to delete the incorrect post and post and share this statement instead. However, we found no evidence that someone named Michael Burdis is (or was) being investigated by the RSPCA in connection with dogfighting activities, and the Scruples Whippet Rescue notice states only that someone using that name inquired of them about some dogs via Facebook. The photograph circulated with this warning (not reproduced here) appears to be a picture of someone by the same name from the U.S. who has no connection to any of the claims. A similar unconfirmed warning was circulated in April 2013 naming Dell Schanze as the person going to animal shelters to obtain dogs for use as bait in dog fights. And in May 2017, the \"bags in trees\" version of the rumor re-emerged on Facebook, purportedly confirmed by a police department in Pennsylvania: re-emerged Facebook SHARING!!!!I usually don't post much on Facebook however, I just wanted to spread the word/ make people aware of this. So I came home yesterday and noticed a bag hanging from a tree that had not been there when I left my house for about an hour, if that. The bag immediately caught my attention for some reason and it's placement looked like it had been put there on purpose rather than trash that blew into the tree. It was positioned right at the corner of my fence. For some reason, I thought I remembered hearing someone tell me that there had been other cases of this and that it was related to marking houses for people who apparently steal dogs. When I walked out and looked at the tree and the bag, I noticed that the bag was tied in 3 different places to the tree meaning someone clearly put it there for a reason, so that alone was strange to me. Even though I thought they would tell me I was psycho for calling, I called 911 and explained the situation to them and asked if I should contact SPCA or something with this problem. I was surprised to hear that this was a concerning problem and that I was correct for calling/ report it to the police. I was even more alarmed when the 911 dispatcher asked me if I had any dogs and if so if they were inside to which I replied that my dog was inside. He then asked me if I was aware of the several recent cases of dogs being stolen/ going missing while in their own backyards. I was instructed to lock my doors, keep myself and my dog inside, not to touch the bag or any evidence at the scene and that they were sending out a police officer right away. I was told that this \"tagging\" or \"marking\" is thought to be used for people who are scoping out neighborhoods/ homes in which people have dogs that go outside or are left outside alone even for brief periods of time. They mark the house with a plastic bag tied to a tree at the home to leave a mark for people who will then come later and apparently lure dogs out of their yard and steal them. Although not absolutely certain why they are stealing them, they are apparently being used for dog fighting. Smaller breeds, larger breeds, or medium breeds. As I knew many of my friends here on Facebook have dogs or many of us have dogs of course, I wanted to spread the word. I was told by the police officer as well as the 911 dispatcher that even if letting the dog out for 5 minutes to go with them.   please read this especially if you have a dog or dogs!!!! pic.twitter.com/Gh0sYVtD2l pic.twitter.com/Gh0sYVtD2l  Bella (@b3llaconigliaro) May 19, 2017 May 19, 2017  Yet again, the warning to dog owners was shared tens of thousands of times. We contacted the Dallastown Police Department in Dallastown, Pennsylvania in an attempt to confirm that police validated the user's concerns about bags in trees and dog theft. An employee with whom we spoke denied they received any reports of dog kidnapping overall, including the sort connected to bags in trees.",

First it was a rare oarfish that had grown to a freakish 100-foot length.  This time it was a giant squid measuring a whopping 160 feet from head to tentacle tip.  These giants look different but experts believe they share one important commonality: they both come from the waters near the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant in the Futaba District of Japan. Scientists believe that following the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant an unknown number of sea creatures suffered genetic mutations that triggered uncontrolled growth  or \"radioactive gigantism.\" Unfortunately, this cadre of mutant giants seems to be drifting towards the continental U.S.  Local officials in Santa Monica, CA  where the creature drifted ashore  tried to calm residents. By later that day, links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article.  However, that article was just a bit of fictional humor (a follow-up to an earlier fictional item about a giant oarfish supposedly discovered off the California coast) spoofing recent alarmist reports about dangerous radioactivity reaching the U.S. from Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant.

        "justification": "On 18 September 2016, the \"Donald Trump for President\" Facebook page posted a photograph of Hillary Clinton along with the claim that the Democratic presidential nominee had spent over $1 billion on negative attack ads targeting Trump, but she had spent no money at all on political ads touting her own political record and accomplishments:  The image asks viewers to \"share if you agree,\" but its claims are not up for debate. They are false.  First, the Hillary Clinton campaign has not spent \"over $1 billion on negative Trump ads on TV.\" Although Clinton has run a number of negative TV spots attacking her rival, she has not spent anywhere near $1 billion on such ads. Shortly after this image was published in September 2016, NBC partner Advertising Analytics released a report detailing how much money each of the candidates had spent on ads. They recorded that Clinton's campaign spent about $90 million on ads during the general election (up to 20 September 2016), while pro-Clinton groups had spent an additional $60 million or so: report Hillary Clinton and her allies continue to dominate Donald Trump and pro-Trump outside groups in the 2016 advertising race. According to ad-spending data from NBC partner Advertising Analytics, Clinton's campaign has spent $96.4 million in ads in the general election, versus $17.3 million for Trump's campaign. That's more than a 5-to-1 advantage for Clinton. And then when you factor in outside groups, it's $156.6 million for Team Clinton, and $33.6 million for Team Trump. That's almost a 5-to-1 advantage. It's also false to say that Clinton has never released a political ad touting her own accomplishments. The Clinton campaign has issued a number of videos touting her accomplishments from her 30-plus years of public service, including one that highlighted her work with children and health care and another featuring President Obama talking about Clinton's many achievements (including becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major party).  children and health care achievements Even if we assume the original image referred only to paid television advertising, it's still wrong in light of examples such as a June 2016 Clinton TV spot that showcased several highlights of her political career: ",

In the end, this fool ruler will cause the great eagle  presumably the United States  to suffer and fall. The below meme circulated in early 2021:   It is unclear where this quatrain originated from or who the original poster was. Nostradamus, who was also a French physician, first published Les Prophties in 1555.

Les Prophties remained prominent Nostradamus is credited with accurately predicting many historical events, according to Rare Books Digest. And though many of his poems are largely vague and could apply to a number of events, some of his predictions do come eerily close to actual events. Rare Books Digest eerily close But the meme in question does not appear to make that list. A look through The Compleat Works of Nostradamus did not reveal any mention of a jezebel or a feeble man. And though the word plague was mentioned more than 30 times in the Nostradamus text, there is no instance where it occurs alongside the same wording as in the meme. look The Compleat Works of Nostradamus reveal Furthermore, it is also important to note that the quatrains written by Nostradamus do not follow chronological order.

At the top, purported Syrian refugees enjoyed luxury accommodations at an unnamed hotel; at the bottom, an American veteran and his dog were left to survive on the streets. The top image was originally published by the British tabloidExpress on 28 September 2014(more than a year before its November 2015 popularity), along with an article titled \"EXCLUSIVE: Taxpayers fund migrants B&B rooms in top holiday destinations.\" The paper held:\nThe Daily Express has learned that beleaguered Home Office officials have turned to Britannia Hotels, one of the UKs largest groups, to solve the UKs growing asylum epidemic. article Coach loads of African and Arab refugees have checked in to the three-star Heathlands and Roundhouse hotels in Britains premier destination resort while their claims for asylum are processed. The asylum seekers arrived here illegally, the majority via the Port of Calais, which is now home to 2,000 would-be illegal immigrants from a rainbow nation of war-torn countries like Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan.   Whether or not those claims were accurate, a few things stood out. One was that the image depicted purported asylum seekers in the United Kingdom. As such, whatever their housing arrangements might have been, it bore little relevance to the plight of homeless American veterans. While an objection could be raised about the strategy of sheltering refugees in hotels overall, it isn't as if those British bed & breakfast rooms could have been used to get American servicemen off the streets of the U.S. TheExpress claimed asylum seekers enjoyed luxury accommodations, but the hotel the paper named maintained a very low 2.5 star rating on TripAdvisor. Nightly lodging rates for the property started at a miserly $52 a night, and travelers described it as \"cheap,\" \"run-down,\" in need of \"renovations,\" \"shabby,\" \"grubby,\" and \"the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.\" Several were moved to share pictorial representations of the luxury they enjoyed as non-refugee guests of the hotel: TripAdvisor       Moreover, the original article didn't reference the 2015 flood of refugees from Syria. It identified the asylum seekers in question as primarily from Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan. On 9 October 2014, Bournemouth'sDaily Echo published an article titled \"Red Cross worker: the real story of the asylum seekers' \"seaside holiday\" in Bournemouth.\" According to that piece, the original claims were distorted and deliberately misleading:\nEnjoying a seaside break in luxury, complete with swimming pools and champagne: these are some of the ways the plight of asylum seekers being housed in hotels on the south coast have been described in recent weeks. article As a British Red Cross worker, Id like to share with you what I saw. Last week, we arranged for an elderly woman to be taken to A&E because she had not eaten for three days. She was so weak she couldnt even walk. After the group were dropped off at the hotel, it took four days before anyone, including the local authority and the Red Cross, found out ... The hospital raised the alarm when two asylum seekers presented themselves at A&E. And thats when we were called in. We provided basics such as clothes, nappies and female sanitary products, as well as facilitating access to doctors, midwives and health visitors ... At the Red Cross, we support refugees and asylum seekers every day  but Ive never seen so many people treated like this before.   While it's true that asylum seekers were temporarily housed in a bed & breakfast in Bournemouth in 2014, the meme created themisleading impression that such accommodation was had at the expense of American veterans' care. The image was in fact purportedly taken in Britain in 2014, originally published as part of an anti-refugee missive. A Red Cross worker later stepped forward to clarify that the individuals housed in travel lodging were weak and ill upon their arrival in Britain, not enjoying the amenities of a free vacation. Moreover, whether the images truly depicted asylum seekers or merely involved three non-British vacation-goers remained to be seen. TheExpress didn't elaborate as to how they determined that the asylum seekers in question were the fellows depicted in the image. In any event, the actual asylum seekers temporarily staying in Bournemouth in no way detracted from resources available to veterans in the United States.

This message is spam and is in no way affiliated with Dell Children's Medical Center or the Seton Family of Hospitals. If you receive this message, please delete it. As demonstrated so aptly by public efforts to provide relief to earthquake victims in Haiti, beneficences initiated by cell phone generally involve a tracking and billing mechanism that requires participants to text a specific short word or phrase to a particular (five-digit) number, not the willy-nilly forwarding of a explanatory narrative to as many people as possible. Haiti In 2009 we began to note that \"Forward this message to help fund medical care for a sick or dying child\" appeals were beginning to appear as cell phone text messages as well as being passed in e-mail. That trend continues into the present, with the \"shot 14-year-old boy\" just another iteration of the same basic hoax that falsely claims the American Cancer Society, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, or some other large entity will donate a predetermined amount of money every time a particular message is forwarded. Such leg-pulls have been circulating via e-mail since 1997. hoax Typically, a large charity is named as the benefactor standing ready to direct monies towards the costs of medical care for the languishing child, but various corporations have also been fingered for this role in other iterations of the hoax, such as AOL and ZDNet in the Rachel Arlington leg pull (brain cancer sufferer in need of an operation) and McDonald's and Pizza Hut in the Justin Mallory prank (epileptic in need of long-term care). Rachel Arlington Justin Mallory Everyone wants to help sick children get better, and the thought of a little boy or girl suffering from some dread disease or infirmity because people couldn't be bothered to forward a message tugs straight at the heartstrings. Problem is, hoaxsters know that, and they play upon these very human drives for their personal amusement. Once again, that is the case here: Well-intentioned forwarding does nothing towards helping a sick child; it does, however, make the day of some prankster. If you want to make a difference in a sick child's life, the best way is still the old-fashioned one: donate your money or your time, don't passively share a worthless message.

        "justification": "FACT CHECK Was a Kansas schoolgirl named Alyssa sharply reprimanded by a teacher for writing her name in cursive?  Claim: A Kansas schoolgirl named Alyssa was sharply reprimanded by a teacher for writing her name in cursive.   UNDETERMINED Example:  [Collected via e-mail, September 2015] This photo is circulating around FB claiming that a teacher reprimanded a student for writing her name in cursive on her assignments. I find it a bit hard to believe... Here is what she posted with the photo: \"Share this everywhere... Alyssa is 7!!! Not only is her mother a military veteran but, she took the time to teach her very young child how to write in cursive... This is her teacher's response... What is wrong with today's school system/society??? #cursive\" Origins:  On 16 September 2015, Facebook user Brenda Hatcher published the photograph displayed above along with the following text: published Share this everywhere... Alyssa is 7!!! Not only is her mother a military veteran but, she took the time to teach her very young child how to write in cursive... This is her teacher's response... What is wrong with today's school system/society??? #cursive Hatcher's request that Facebook users \"share this everywhere\" was apparently heeded, as the photograph and lament racked up more than a quarter of a million shares in just a few days. However, her call to action and the target of her frustration remained difficult to discern in the context presented. Was the image share-worthy because of the teacher's firm tone? Was it because the utility of handwriting has declined in an era of increasingly computer-based communication? Should the teacher have been softer with the child of a veteran? A report by Philadelphia television station WTXF publicized the story, which was itself largely aggregated from the blog PopSugar. However, neither of those articles added much of any information about the claim or the people it involved. In the comments section of her Facebook post, Hatcher provided a scant few additional details: She identified the mother of the child as a woman named Gail Varney and tagged her, and she later referenced \"awareness\" but again did not specify what she believed fellow Facebook users ought to be aware of: report blog Thank you for all the shares everyone! It's definitely raising some awareness... I'd also like to know what the teacher's punishment was going to be... I mean, really??? What are you gonna do Mrs. Teacher? Suspend her from school for being 7 and able to write in cursive? Does she not get to go out for recess??? What a joke. In a subsequent post Hatcher stated that the image was reported to Facebook for nudity, separately saying the teacher \"claim[ed Alyssa] can't write in cursive because the other students don't know how to do that yet\" and adding: post I don't know who the teacher is or the school. The mother wants that information to remain private ... She's taking measures into her own hands. I can assure you that she's doing all she can. It's difficult to imagine which necessary \"measures\" Alyssa's mother would take: schoolwork is commonly dictated by reasonable instructions (such as requiring printing or cursive writing) issued by teachers for their assignments. While Hatcher's claims about Alyssa and a teacher's red-ink remarks concerning the use of cursive have proved popular on Facebook, the precise nature of the controversy remains something of a mystery despite its viral penetration. From the little disclosed by Hatcher, the teacher's remarks indicated that the child was previously asked not to use cursive to write her name. Hatcher indicated Alyssa was seven at the time of the controversy, placing her in first or second grade (a detail she said the girl's mother wished not be included). Recent statewide educational standards in Kansas provide for the introduction of cursive in third grade, so the use of cursive before a class has broached it formally may be frowned upon, as incorrect usage at the introduction stage could potentially inhibit the classroom's ability to develop correct form. provide Subsequent comments from Hatcher did little to explain whether users ought to be outraged over the general topic of cursive, the treatment of veterans' kids, or a heretofore not articulated offense visible only to those bothered by it (of whom there are presumably more than 300,000). We contacted Hatcher to see if she would share any corroborating details (or information about the issue requiring \"awareness\") but have not yet received a response.

STT said blog post Jan. 28, 2021 Berlin on the Brink! Winter Blackouts Loom As Coal Plants Run At 100% Capacity, Struggle to Keep Lights On Reddit World News Era While it is true that solar panels and wind turbines can suffer during periods of extreme cold and high snow pilings, it is not accurate to say that Germany experienced a total collapse of power. It is also inaccurate to say that coal and nuclear power were required to step up to make up the difference. In particular, NoTricksZone cited a video produced by German national broadcaster Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB) that had reportedly been taken down by the channel but was reuploaded to YouTube by wind energy protest group Vernunftkraft.du. NoTricksZone said that in the video, Daniel Bartig, a mechanic at the LEAG Lausitz power plant, said that he was skeptical that green energy can do the job and that the greatest share of power is currently coming from coal. Harald Schwarz, professor of power distribution at the University of Cottbus, said that he is very skeptical of wind and solar energy doing the job: YouTube With this supply of wind and photovoltaic energy, its between 0 and 2 or 3 percent  that is de facto zero. You can see it in many diagrams that we have days, weeks, in the year where we have neither wind nor PV. Especially this time for example  there is no wind and PV, and there are often times when the wind is very miniscule. These are things, I must say, that have been physically established and known for centuries, and weve simply totally neglected this during the green energies discussion. While our emails to RBB, Schwarz and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy went unanswered, an investigation into Germanys power grid in early 2021 revealed that such claims were largely unfounded. Germany is heralded as a leader in wind and solar power. In 2013, leaders launched Energiewende, a movement to shift the power grid to a more efficient and carbon-neutral system, eliminate electricity generated from nuclear by 2022, and fully phase out coal by 2038. And movements in early 2021 continued a shift from nuclear, as well as coal and oil, to a more diversified system. As of December 2019, about 12% of Germanys electricity came from nuclear energy produced at seven reactors, while over 40% of electricity came from coal, according to the World Nuclear Association, an international organization that promotes nuclear power. By and large, coal was the largest source of power generation in 2019, according to a 2020 report published by the International Energy Agency. World Nuclear Association International Energy Agency Those numbers shifted slightly in 2020, according to preliminary data published by the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW), which found that 44.6% of energy sourced in Germany in 2020 was from renewables  nearly a quarter of which was produced by onshore and offshore wind, and 8.9% of which was solar, reported Clean Energy Wire. Clean Energy Wire   But other energy sources still hold a share in that total. Natural gas made up 16.2%, while nuclear clocked in around 11.4%, and hard coal 7.5%, so its not out of the ordinary for Germany to be getting its energy from coal and nuclear sources, particularly in the winter. The largest issue with Germanys power grid, according to the IEA, is that most of the wind capacity is located in the northern region whereas most of the demand is in urban regions to the south  and transporting wind power can be a difficult and arduous task. According to STT report, Germanys millions of solar panels are blanketed in snow and ice and were thus rendered useless: So much for the transition to an all wind and sun powered future  aka the Energiewende. Despite being the object of consternation and much vilification over the last 20 years, Germanys coal-fired plants are now being appreciated for what they are: truly meaningful power generation sources, available on demand, whatever the weather. With a Nationwide blackout a heartbeat away, the German obsession with unreliable wind and solar is like a time bomb set to explode. It is true that solar panels require sunlight to produce energy and that being covered in snow can hamper their efficiency, but that doesnt mean that they are rendered useless. Most solar panels are tilted at an angle, so snow will slide off on its own. And if it doesnt, caretakers will simply remove the snow without damaging the panels, according to the solar industry company Energy Sage. Cold, sunny weather is actually good for panels. Winter months are actually good for solar energy production, as long as your panels arent covered by snow. Like most electronics, solar panels function more efficiently in cold conditions than in hot, wrote the solar industry experts. This means that your panels will produce more power for each precious hour of sunshine during the short days of winter. wrote And according to the U.S. Department of Energy, a little snow has little impact on solar panels. While heavy snow can limit the amount of energy produced, light is still able to move through the snow  even when panels are completely covered by snow, they can still generate energy. U.S. Department of Energy The biggest threat to solar panels from heavy snowfall is weight, which can put stress on the delicate system and photovoltaic panels, which are responsible for generating electricity via sunlight. The TSS report also claimed that freezing weather has halted 30,000 wind turbines, which could in part be true. Turbines use wind to make electricity when it rotates the blades around a rotor, which spins a generator to create electricity. But when there is an accumulation of ice on these blades, an increased load can reduce power and damage the blades. spins Cold weather can also shut down equipment, and in places that are ill-equipped for chilly temperatures, this can slow down energy production. But NoTricksZone reported that 30,000 wind turbines in Germany were largely out of operation, and in a world 100% reliant on green energies, this would mean near 100% darkness at home. Snopes did not find evidence to confirm that tens of thousands of turbines were out of operation; neither is it true that Germany is fully dependent on green energies  yet.",

        ],
        "justification": "In December 2023, one of the most common examples of the Mandela Effect saw renewed online attention thanks in part to a TikTok video on the topic: that the Fruit of the Loom company logo once contained a cornucopia. The Mandela Effect is generally defined as a \"collective misremembering\" in which large numbers of people share the same false belief.  video generally defined @dimelifting #mandelaeffect #storytime #fypppp #greenscreen  original sound - Nicole  The TikTok video in question concludes that there has been a massive coverup at the corporate level. The video's creator decries the effect the alleged obfuscation has had on the general public. The cornucopia removal and coverup is \"one of the greatest marketing ploys in history,\" she argued, \"but at what cost?\" Fervent belief in a Fruit of the Loom cornucopia is not uncommon. A post on Quora captures this viewpoint: post I have a strong opinion about the Fruit of the Loom logo and whether it had a cornucopia or not. I remember seeing a cornucopia in the logo when I was a kid, and I learned what it was from my school. A cornucopia is a horn-shaped basket that is filled with fruits and vegetables, and it symbolizes abundance and prosperity. I think the cornucopia made sense for the Fruit of the Loom brand because it showed that they had a variety of quality products. An image of the purported logo is often shared in defense of this claim: purported logo  However, that is a fabrication, not the actual Fruit of the Loom logo. The perception of a cornucopia goes back decades. For example, a 1994 piece in a local Florida paper about the actor, Samuel Wright, who played Sebastian the Crab in \"The Little Mermaid\" and who also appeared in Fruit of the Loom commercials, repeated the assertion that the logo contained a cornucopia in print: 1994 piece For 19 years, Wright made anywhere from 120-140 television commercials for Fruit of the Loom underwear. And he didn't even wear Fruit of the Looms. He wore skimpy bikini briefs. \"My wife is European,\" he says from a hotel room in Tampa. \"She said (cotton underwear) made me look like an old man.\" Anyhow, Fruit of the Loom's logo was initially a cornucopia swollen with an apple, green grapes, purple grapes, and their green leaves. Wright was the purple grape cluster. And he had to pretend Fruit of the Looms never found them that were great. While the existence of these commercials is factual, one cannot help but note that nobody played a cornucopia in the actual commercial series referenced in this article: these commercials  The company has, as well, officially weighed in on the claim. On June 26, 2023, the company tweeted an image from a USA Today crossword puzzle that included the clue \"Fruit of the ____ (company that does not, in fact, have a cornucopia in its logo).\" It noted that the \"Mandela Effect is real,\" but that the cornucopia claims were false: tweeted The Mandela Effect is real, the cornucopia in our logo is not ? pic.twitter.com/qoiuvemsIy pic.twitter.com/qoiuvemsIy  Fruit of the Loom (@FruitOfTheLoom) June 26, 2023 June 26, 2023  The Fruit of the Loom logo has always contained an apple, green grapes, purple grapes, and leaves. Snopes searched archived newspaper advertisements from every decade from the 1910s to the 2020s and could not locate a single one with a cornucopia: Snopes searched newspaper advertisements every decade from the 1910s to the 2020s   (Snopes.com) In rebuttal to these facts, at least two major lines of purported evidence have been proffered. In broad terms, these arguments boil down to the claim that there are photographs that show Fruit of the Loom shirts with a logo that includes a cornucopia, and that legal filings related to its trademark describe that company's logo as including a cornucopia. The December TikTok video focused on the former claim. The legal argument is popular on Reddit.  video on Reddit While Snopes has no definitive explanation for the purported photographic evidence, we find its use as proof for an official cornucopia logo weak. Of the hundreds of emails received by Snopes, only two discrete images showing shirts with a cornucopia logo have been produced. Both images are allegedly taken from shirts found in thrift stores.  Most examples sent to Snopes appear to have their origins in a June 2023 post (above) that went viral in the r/funny subreddit, among other places. The only other example (below) stems from the aforementioned TikTok video: June 2023 post TikTok video  The provenance of these photos is unknown, and as a result their utility as evidence is limited. Two shirts on their own do not disprove the mountain of evidence attesting to the lack of cornucopia in the company's official logo. The legal argument presented to Snopes, also proffered on Reddit, is that, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Fruit of the Loom itself described its trademark as containing a cornucopia. on Reddit This misconception stems from the fact that at least one trademark registration document apparently filed by Fruit of the Loom used what is known as design search code 05.09.14 to describe the trademark  indicating an image with \"Baskets of fruit; Containers of fruit; [or] Cornucopia (horn of plenty).\" Reddit posts posit that this document has some legal bearing in the world of intellectual property law. registration document First, this is not the case. The primary goal of these search codes, according to the USPTO, is to identify the most \"significant\" visual design elements as an aid for prospective applications to search for similar trademarks. While Snopes has no insight into the legal decisions made by Fruit of the Loom in the 1970s, the 05.09.14 example contained in the USPTO database classification manual does share some visual similarity with the Fruit of the Loom logo at issue: significant  Second, and more to the point, this document is irrelevant. Filed in 1973, the corporate contact was listed as an office in Manhattan. The application itself was rejected by the USPTO. Whatever this document is, it does not represent the active Fruit of the Loom trademark application. The USPTO challenged the cornucopia-containing application in 1980, apparently rejecting it on clerical grounds. The application was officially canceled in 1988.  an office apparently rejecting canceled The active trademark registration, filed in 1981, lists Fruit of the Loom's Kentucky office as its contact and, crucially, does not use database search code 05.09.14. Instead, codes for several other non-cornucopia visual elements are included: active trademark Kentucky office 05.03.08 - More than one leaf, including scattered leaves, bunches of leaves not attached to branches 05.03.25 - Leaf, single; Other leaves 05.09.02 - Grapes 05.09.05 - Apples 05.09.06 - Avocados; Fruits with pits (apricots, peaches, plums, olives and the like) 26.03.02 - Ovals, plain single line; Plain single line ovals Because the document cited in support of the legal argument that Fruit of the Loom's logo once contained a cornucopia is a failed application that was replaced, or superseded, by an application that contained no descriptors of a cornucopia or cornucopia-related images, it also fails as evidence in support of a cornu-cover-up.

        "justification": "Who is the woman in a viral photo with former President Bill Clinton? She's a photographer and co-founder of a New York-based modeling agency. But if you pose that question to adherents of a Qanon conspiracy theory, you'll probably get a different answer: She's an associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and recruits children to come to the billionaire's island. Qanon conspiracy theory So how did this ordinary citizen get mixed up in the world of Q? It started with a single miscaptioned photograph that supposedly showed her on Epstein's private plane with Clinton:   While this appears to be a genuine, unaltered photograph, the conspiracy theorists spreading it get several things wrong about what it shows. Mainly, the photograph wasn't taken on a plane owned by Epstein, who was charged with new sex crimes related to child-sex-trafficking for prostitution in the summer of 2019.  Before we go any further, we should note that the Q conspiracy theory is built on speculation and wild assumptions. The woman has not been implicated in any legal proceedings related to Epstein, and she has not been charged with any crimes herself (Snopes is not identifying her to protect her privacy). Q conspiracy theory Indeed, Miami Herald reporter Julie Brown, who was fundamental in uncovering Epstein's alleged sex-trafficking crimes, told us that she never come across the woman's name during her investigation into Epstein: \"I have never run across her name anywhere  and I checked with two people involved in the case for 12 years and they never heard of her. They suspect its BS internet conspiracy shit.\"  Julie Brown fundamental We also dug through dozens of Q posts, conspiracy primers, Qanon explainers, and 4chan and 8chan threads attempting to connect her to Clinton and Epstein, but we've yet to see any concrete evidence. Instead, we found invented explanations for out-of-context pictures and illogical leaps of faith being accepted as fact.  The above-displayed picture has been online since 2006. It was originally shared with a caption saying it showed Clinton with a 19-year-old college student aboard billionaire venture capitalist Ron Burkle's private plane. It wasn't until several years later (circa 2017) that the \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy community picked up this picture and started claiming that it showed a woman with Clinton aboard Epstein's plane (popularly dubbed the \"Lolita Express\"). The fact that this photograph was circulating for more than a decade before it became attached to claims relating to Epstein should immediately raise red flags.  shared billionaire venture capitalist circa 2017 Pizzagate Furthermore, photographs reportedly showing the inside of Epstein's plane don't appear to match with this viral picture. Here's a comparison of the viral Clinton photograph and a picture of Epstein's plane obtained by Radar Online: inside of Epstein's plane Radar Online   While we may be entering dot-connecting territory here, the design on the wall behind Clinton bears a resemblance to a photograph from Business Insider supposedly showing the interior of Canadian businessman Frank Giustra's plane. Giustra and Clinton, like Burkle and Clinton, were frequent travel partners: Canadian businessman frequent travel   Angel Urena, Clinton's spokesperson, also denied that the viral image was taken aboard Epstein's plane: \"This photograph was not taken on Epsteins airplane.\" In addition to misidentifying the location of this photograph, Qanon believers also frequently share this photograph with the claim that the woman was underage at the time the photograph was taken. Again, this is based on pure speculation: speculation   When Gawker first shared this photograph in 2006, the organization claimed it showed a \"19-year-old college student.\" This appears to be accurate. In 2009, The Cut identified the woman as a \"22-year-old\" in an article about her photography. This would make her approximately 19 in 2006 when the photograph was allegedly snapped.  Clinton did fly on Epstein's plane a number of times. However, the above-displayed photograph does not document one of these trips. This photograph shows Clinton with a young woman aboard a plane more likely owned by either Burkle or Giustra.  number of times While the question of who she is may send conspiracy theorists down a rabbit hole of assumptions and speculation, the real answer is quite simple: She is a photographer and co-founder of New York-based modeling agency who was needlessly thrown into this world of conspiracy because she once appeared in a photograph on a plane with Clinton.  co-founder Rothschild, Mike.  \"QAnon is Attacking a Random Woman in a Disturbing and Dangerous Way.\"\r\n  Daily Dot.  21 March 2019.

        "justification": "In February 2021, a video went viral on TikTok that supposedly showed a handcuffed man saving a choking police officer's life. The video, which supposedly came from the cop car's dashcam, racked up more than 26 million views within a few days of its initial posting by @kd_k97:   There are strong reasons to doubt this is a genuine video of a handcuffed man saving a choking police officer's life. More likely, it's a staged video that was created as a sort of \"morality play\" asking the viewer to ponder what they would do in this situation.  While there are no explicit disclaimers labeling this footage as a scripted moment as opposed to a genuine incident captured on a police car's dashcam, there are a number of indications that this video could be more accurately captioned as the former.  For one, this \"dashcam\" video did not originate with a police department, a news article, or any other official source. Rather, this video first went viral on TikTok.  This is also just one part of a three-part video series. Part one showed the initial confrontation, involving a Black man being stopped and handcuffed after reports of \"suspicious activity.\" Part two shows the handcuffed man saving the cop's life after he starts to choke. Part three shows the Black man retrieving the cuffs after saving the cop's life, giving them back to the police officer and preparing to be arrested again, before the cop decides to reward his good deed and let him go. Part one showed Part two shows Part three shows While this may be an effective way to break down and share a scripted performance, this would be an odd way to release a genuine police dashcam video.  We have not seen any news reports about this alleged incident, nor have we found any \"official\" versions of this video from a police department. On social media, users also noted that the officer's \"costume\" didn't seem authentic. For instance, he doesn't appear to be wearing a weapon and the \"bullet proof vest\" appears a bit flimsy.  TikTok user kd_k97 has not commented on the authenticity of the video. However, they did respond to a comment that highlighted the intended message of the video:   We reached out to KD97 for more information, and will update this article accordingly. ",

While Goodman did not provide an exact source for the images displayed here, the pictures from \"Ghetto Myspace\" were purportedly culled from real MySpace profiles: Parenting Fails GhettoMyspace.net, recently featured on Tosh.0, Bossip.com, and Death and Taxes Mag, is a site dedicated to real photos from peoples myspace profiles. On this site you will find kids with guns, drug dealing, ghetto booty, hood funerals, and in general people having a great time. May we all have as much fun as the people in the pictures. Goodman removed the post containing these images from Ghettomyspace.net shortly after this article was published. He explained the decision in an email, writing that he wanted \"zero association\" with the community claiming that the images showed Alton Sterling: I've deleted the post. I want zero association with that community. I'm saddened anyone would use these pictures in how i'm guessing they're using them. I don't think it's him and furthermore if you look closely all the guns in the picture are Airsoft guns and not the real thing. Ghettomyspace was always meant to be funny and more commentary on the crazy stuff people share on social media and the gun culture, and at the time the social divide that was happening in 2010 when some people were only on myspace and some were only on facebook. There is no evidence that this image is of Alton Sterling (it bears little more than a passing resemblance to later photographs of him) or that it came from Sterling's MySpace profile:   ",

        "justification": "Film actor John Travolta is not dead. Readers inquired about the actor's well-being in early January 2023 after a death hoax was shared online. We found no credible reporting that said anything of Travolta being in poor health, hospitalized, or anything of the sort. What we did locate, however, was evidence that there had been a number of past death hoaxes about the actor, including a brand new one created on Dec. 30, 2022. Some readers who looked for answers about Travolta's rumored death may have first noticed an article on mediamass.net. That article showed the headline, \"'John Travolta dead 2023' : Actor killed by internet death hoax.\" One thing that some readers may have missed about mediamass.net was that its \"About Us\" page said it publishes satire. But that wasn't the only thing we noticed about this website. According to the top of the story on mediamass.net, it claimed to have been \"last updated on Jan. 3, 2023.\" However, that was not when this article was published. Thanks to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, we know that this article was originally publishedall the way back in 2013. In other words, this was not the new death hoax that we were looking for. The headline and date in the article were changed to give the misleading appearance that the story was new. originally published The roots of the more recent death hoax appeared to stem from an article with the headline, \"John Travolta Dead at 68.\" article This story was published on Dec. 30, 2022, onthe \"prank\" website channel46news.com. The address \"channel46news.com\" might sound like a local news website, but it's not.The website allows anyone to create a \"prank\" news article, which can then be shared with friends. The \"prank\" story read as follows: John Travolta Dead at 68. The famous actor was found unconscious in his home when a family member found him, the family member called 911 and ambulances arrived rushing him to the hospital and for about 2 hours the actor was still unconscious, until 11:43am, He had stopped breathing and from then on had passed away. No further details has been provided has doctors are still trying to find the cause for his death. Our deepest condolences go out to his family and friends who had lost. Some fans have posted on Twitter saying \"Rest in peace John Travolta, Heaven has gained another angel and you are with Olivia in heaven\". We send our love for family, friends and fans. The death hoax was shared right around the anniversary of the death of Travolta's son, Jett, who died on Jan. 2, 2009. According to CBS News, he died at the age of 16 \"after having a seizure and hitting his head in a bathtub.\" Travolta's wife, actor Kelly Preston, also died in 2020 of breast cancer. CBS News died We found several Facebook posts where users appeared to believe the recent \"prank\" death hoax or another one about Travolta supposedly passing away. several Facebook posts appeared believe Some of the commenters under these posts pointed to the story from mediamass.net as proof that Travolta was not dead. Again, while it was true that Travolta was alive, the mediamass.net article was nearly a decade old by that point, and had nothing to do with the newer death hoax. Some users also appeared to have seen prior death hoaxes about Travolta, such as YouTube videos with titles like, \"30 minutes ago/ RIP John Travolta/ Goodbye John Travolta,\" \"John Travolta has just passed away at his home, He will be buried next to his friend Newton-John,\" and \"10 Minutes Ago / Sad News John Travolta Is Pass Away Expected Soon Family Prepare To Say Goodbye.\" YouTube videos  All of these videos were misleading and false.

        "justification": "Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Palo Alto University professor who testified before Congress in September 2018 that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her while they were both in high school in the 1980s, was the focus of a number of baseless and false rumors spread in an attempt to tarnish her credibility.  number baseless false rumors spread attempt tarnish credibility One of the more disturbing smear campaigns centered an alleged photograph of Ford from 1982 that was shared along with comments insinuating that she was too physically unattractive for a handsome young man such as Brett Kavanaugh to target for sexual assault: A number of individuals also shared this fake photograph alongside a genuine image of Brett Kavanaugh from his high school yearbook in order to strengthen their flawed argument that \"handsome\" Brett would never assault \"ugly\" Ford: shared yearbook   This comparison did not a use a real photograph of Christine Blasey Ford, but nonetheless it was widely shared on Twitter, Facebook, internet forums and web sites along with comments claiming that it was \"proof\" of Kavanaugh's innocence as he would never sexually assault someone who was \"ugly\": comments claiming proof innocence sexually assault \nThis is Dr. Ford in 1982. I am going to go ahead and say this proves that she is lying. Christine Blasey ford in 1982. Proof positive Kavanaugh is innocent! Im pretty sure no one was banging this chick in 1982. #justsaying #christineblaseyford #kavanaugh #metoo Christine Blasey Ford in 1982. She must have been fending off men with a stick. ??????? This was Christine Blasey Ford in 1982. Theres NOT enough beer on the planet.... Christine Blasey Ford in 1982. Proof positive Kavanaugh is innocent! This is Christine Blasey Ford in 1982 , I think she was delusional, \" some thing did happen to her ! But not with who she dreamed up ! These pictures are of Christine Blasey Ford the paid accuser and Judge Brett Kavanaugh from 1982, is confirmation of his innocence ... I don't think Brett would have been 1000 miles close to where Christine Blasey Ford was. What say you all?\n This picture was also shared by Lanny Lancaster, the Cabarrus County (North Carolina) GOP chairman, with the caption:  This is the alleged sexual assault victim. Wow. Lancaster defended his decision to share the photograph to the News Observer, arguing that he was simply trying to show that the media's portrayal of Ford was inaccurate: caption News Observer \nI didnt say anything. I just said this is her picture. Basically, the media is distorting the facts on this lady. Everything shes said is made up. She has no evidence whatsoever. I support that theory, Lancaster said. Lancaster said he takes issue with how the news media is portraying Fords early life. The media wants you to think she was a beautiful young lady who was on her way home from the tennis courts ...  Lancaster said. I just wanted you to see the real person. I wanted people to see that this is really her. The problem with the argument implied here is twofold. First, sexual assaulters targets victims based on factors other than physical appearance. The notion that physical attractiveness of the victim is a primary criterion in such attacks is a myth that perpetuates the harmful notion that it is a woman's fault for being assaulted: myth \nMyth: Only certain kinds of people get raped. It cannot happen to me. FACT: Rapists act without considering their victim's physical appearance, dress, age, race, gender, or social status. Assailants seek out victims who they perceive to be vulnerable. The Orange County Rape Crisis Center has worked with victims from infancy to ninety-two years of age and from all racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Myth: Women incite men to rape. FACT: Research has found that the vast majority of rapes are planned. Rape is the responsibility of the rapist alone. Women, children and men of every age, physical type and demeanor are raped. Opportunity is the most important factor determining when a given rapist will rape. Second, this photograph does not show Christine Blasey Ford, in 1982 or in any other year. This picture is one of an as-yet unidentified person which has been used for various memes ever since it first appeared on the internet in \"Bad Yearbook\" and \"Bad Family Photo\" galleries around 2011. Blasey Ford's name was never attached to this photograph until September 2018, when internet trolls began to claim so without evidence in order to tarnish her credibility.

        "justification": "  Claim:  Dynamic Pet Products Real Ham Bone have caused several dogs to fall ill and die. UNPROVEN Example:  [Collected via Facebook, March 2015] \nI started this Face book page in 2010. I lost my beautiful Black Labrador retriever on 3/8/2010. He ate one of these bones and it broke into sharp shards and punctured his bowel. I took the rest back to Same Club and the manager said he wouldn't sell them anymore. Sad to say not true. The FDA investigation is going on supposedly , but I hear beings its a pet \"treat\" they won't or can't do nothing. Sad to hear people are still losing there pets , 5 years and counting since I lost Sammie. Hopefully someday these heartless bastards will stop looking at $$$ and cease making them. RIP Sammie.\n \n I purchased a Real Ham Bone made by Dynamic Pet Products, from Wal-Mart on Sunday 3/1/15. I gave it to Fred, our bassett hound, he chewed on it and ingested some. By Monday morning 3/2/15, he was vomiting and having severe diarrhea. By the afternoon, he was bleeding out of his rectum and we rushed him to the vet. He was put in intensive care and we were told he was so sick, the vet recommended we put him to sleep. I am never going to forgive myself for buying him that deadly treat. Please share this so others don't make the same mistake I did. DYNAMIC PET PRODUCTS (in Missouri) know they've killed dozens of dogs and they still sell them at big retail companies like Sam's Club and Wal-Mart.   Origins:   On 4 March 2015, Facebook user Khristie Collins-Reed published the above-displayed photographs to  Facebook  Facebook following the death of her family's basset hound, Fred. Both on Facebook and in an interview with a local news station, members of her family stated that Fred had received a Dynamic Pet Products Real Ham Bone on 1 March 2015 and died the following day.   The family's story was not the first complaint lodged about Dynamic Pet Products Real Ham Bone. Several negative reviews had been published to consumer complaint sites, spanning several years and alleging problems similar to those reported by Reed's family. (Additional warnings have circulated among animal lovers on social media sites about canine jerky  treats and other forms of pet chew treats.) reviews jerky chew As early as 2010, U.S. the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had investigated Dynamic Pet Products Real Ham Bone following consumer complaints, and at that time a disclaimer about the product displayed on the manufacturer's web site stated that: investigated \n\nNot recommended for aggressive chewers  we recommend they eat a Beef Bone. As with all natural bones, we recommend supervision during eating.\n\n The FDA did not issue a specific warning about Dynamic Pet Products Real Ham Bone at that time, but the agency did issue a general warning against bones as chew toys in 2010. According to the FDA, rectal bleeding, intestinal blockage, and broken teeth were among the adverse outcomes linked to bones: bones \n\n\"Some people think it's safe to give dogs large bones, like those from a ham or a roast,\" says Carmela Stamper, D.V.M., a veterinarian in the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the Food and Drug Administration. \"Bones are unsafe no matter what their size. Giving your dog a bone may make your pet a candidate for a trip to your veterinarian's office later, possible emergency surgery, or even death.\" \"Make sure you throw out bones from your own meals in a way that your dog can't get to them,\" adds Stamper, who suggests taking the trash out right away or putting the bones up high and out of your dog's reach until you have a chance to dispose of them. \"And pay attention to where your dog's nose is when you walk him around the neighborhood  steer him away from any objects lying in the grass.\"\n Veterinarians who treated Fred before his death in March 2015 said they weren't sure whether Dynamic Pet Products Real Ham Bone was to blame: \n\nFred was in such bad shape when they took him to California Veterinary Specialists in Carlsbad that the family said their goodbyes and put him down. The veterinarians [said] they did not have a definitive answer about what made Fred ill because the family could not afford to run the tests. The family seems certain the bone broke apart and ripped apart Fred's insides.\n Dynamic Pet Products released a statement in response to the claims advising dog owners to supervise pets with any treats or snacks. According to the FDA, bones are generally unsafe for dogs and should not be given as treats.

MIXTURE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, April 2013] \nThere is currently a petition about a law passed by the U.S. House of Representatives with the acronym\nof CISPA.  It claims that various rights allowed under the Constitution will be violated if it passes the U.S. Senate.  Are the allegations true as the\nlaw is written?  What is the real intent of the law if it is different from what is being reported?\n\n   Origins:   On 18 April 2013, the U.S. House of Representatives (but not yet the Senate) passed Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA).  The intent of CISPA is to assist  the federal government in combating threats from hackers and cybercriminals (both in the U.S. and abroad) by facilitating the voluntary sharing of information about Internet users between the government and private companies. Critics of CISPA content that the bill's privacy protections are insufficient or nonexistent, particularly because it does not require the government to secure a warrant prior to  obtaining information on individuals' Internet activity, nor does it allow Internet users to hold companies that share their information with the government legally liable (even though such sharing may violate those companies' stated privacy policies).   Mike Rogers, a Michigan representative and the House Intelligence Committee chairman, has been one of proponents of CISPA, stating that \"People were stealing their identities, their accounts, their intellectual property, and subsequent to that, their jobs. [Users] began to question the value of getting on Internet and using [it] for commercial purposes. Their trust in the free and open Internet ... was at risk.\" Colorado representative Jared Polis has been an outspoken critic of CISPA, criticizing it as \"the biggest government takeover of personal information that I've seen during my time here in Congress.\"   The House Intelligence Committee has published a document entitled \"Myths and Facts about the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA)\" to counter criticisms of the bill. published CISPA still has a ways to go before becoming enacted as law, as it must be passed by the Senate and signed by President Obama.  Neither is a slam dunk, as a similar CISPA bill was passed by the House in 2012 but failed to clear the Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget issued a statement proclaiming that \"If the bill, as currently crafted, were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\"  Last updated:  22 April 2013\n ",

You cant get much more toxic than TBHQ. This synthetic preservative is created from butane (a very toxic gas) and has been linked to vision disturbances, liver enlargement, childhood behavioral problems, and stomach cancer in animal studies. New research coming out of Michigan State University links it to the rise in food allergies, which has prompted more research. Although the FDA allows this in America, this additive is banned for use in food in other countries including Japan, and is on the Center For Science in The Public Interests list as one of the worst additives to be avoided in our food. Please share! #FoodBabeArmy TBHQ, tertiary butylhydroquinone, is a synthetic antioxidant that is commonly used as a food preservative. Although TBHQ does contain a butyl moiety, this does not mean that the preservative is \"created from butane\" (which is commonly used as lighter fluid). In response to a similar claim made in 2007 about McDonald's Chicken McNuggets, the ScienceBlogs web site explained TBHQ's relationship to butane: ScienceBlogs TBHQ contains a butyl moiety (a tert-butyl moiety, more accurately), but so does butter, which contains esters of the blameless butyrate (when degraded to free butyrate, its the origin of the smell of rancid butter, esterified, as in fresh butter, its not a problem). Butter is not lighter fluid, nor is TBHQ. A butyl group does not butane make. Its worth noting that preservatives might not be entirely benign (you also encounter BHT and BHA, your cereal boxs cardboard is probably impregnated with one of these). However, none of these are lighter fluid by a long shot. While it's true that TBHQ has been banned in Japan, it is not \"toxic,\" as the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority both classify TBHQ as a safe food additive in the small amounts present in foods such as Cheez-It snack crackers. FDA European Food Safety Authority In response to the message posted by \"Food Babe,\" Cheez-It stated on their Facebook page that they have been testing natural alternatives to TBHQ:  While synthetic preservatives may not be the healthiest of options, TBHQ is not \"created from butane,\" it is not \"toxic, nor is it been deemed by the FDA to be dangerous to consume in moderate quantities.

Those intent upon snapping up free stuff via such lures should keep in mind that there is often a further downside to the process beyond their personal disappointment and the financial enrichment of the scam artists preying upon their gullibility: All too often such adventures in clickjacking also result in the download of trojans and other viruses onto the computers of those looking to score the promised goodies.

The Costco $150 coupon offer is a variation of the company anniversary survey scam, a ploy that also depends on the unwary unwittingly promoting the phony coupon to their social media friends: anniversary survey scam These web pages (which are not operated or sponsored by the companies they reference) typically ask the unwary to click what appear to be Facebook share buttons and post comments to the scammers site (which is really a ruse to dupe users into spreading the scam by sharing it with all of their Facebook friends). Those who follow such instructions are then led into a set of pages prompting them to input a fair amount of personal information (including name, age, address, and phone numbers), complete a lengthy series of surveys, and finally sign up (and commit to paying) for at least two Reward Offers (e.g., Netflix subscriptions, credit report monitoring services, prepaid credit cards)[.]",

For example, the caption for one ad read, \"They're Closing Doors In 2024.

It's Time To Say Goodbye, These Fast Food Restaurants Be Closing The Doors.\" Several other variations of these ads were also displayed online.  The ads appeared to claim that Five Guys would be closing all of its locations, going bankrupt or going out of business for other reasons. However, this was false. All of the ads led to an article on Reference.com with the headline, \"These 53 Restaurant Chains Are on the Brink of Disappearing Entirely.\" The article's page source code indicated that the story was perhaps written during or before the year 2020 and was last republished in 2021. In other words, the article that was being advertised in December 2023 was two or more years old. article The article listed 68 different businesses, most that appeared to be American brands. Under each business name were several paragraphs describing whether the companies would be closing some or all of its locations. In other words, the article was fairly long. Nowhere in the apparent 68-slide article was Five Guys mentioned even once. The ads with the photos of Five Guys restaurant locations were false and misleading clickbait that may have originally been created to lure readers to click or scroll through 68 slides for nothing. The reason why these kinds of ads and articles exist is usually something called advertising arbitrage. Advertising arbitrage is a strategy in which an advertiser hopes to make more money on ads displayed in a lengthy article than it would cost to display an initial clickbait ad meant to attract users to the article. In other words, instead of the ads being both attractive and potentially helpful to consumers, they instead mislead users from the start. Advertising arbitrage We reached out to Five Guys by email to ask if they had a statement to share regarding the false and misleading ads and will update this story if we receive a response.

Read our special coverage, contribute to support our mission, and submit any tips or claims you see here.\n Read contribute here In June 2020, several social media users copy-pasted a piece of text across social media that claimed the Rev. Al Sharpton was paid $24,000 to speak at the funeral of George Floyd, the Black man whose death while in police custody sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice. social media     Verbatim or near-verbatim copies of this message  \"Al Sharpton was paid $24,000 to speak at George Floyd's funeral\"  have been shared by dozens of users on Facebook and Twitter. The earliest posting of this message that we could find was shared on June 13, a few days after Floyd's funeral service, by Brian Benedetto. That post had been shared more than 69,000 times:   However, none of the posts that we examined offered any evidence to support the claim. These posts weren't accompanied by links to news articles, quotes, TV interviews, financial records, or any other evidence to prove this accusation. It seems that this claim was simply conjured up out of thin air.  This type of post, a piece of text overlaid on a bright background, is frequently used to share unfounded claims, which are repeated over and over until some people become convinced that they are true.  Poynter wrote in 2019: Poynter When Facebook started letting users post text on top of colored backgrounds in 2016, it seemed like a fairly benign way to get people to share more personal thoughts on the platform. [...] But since then, like other formats on Facebook, the text post feature has been weaponized into an effective way to spread misinformation on the platform. Over the past few weeks, some of the most viral hoaxes on Facebook have spread in the form of text posts. They make salacious political claims without linking to any website or attaching a photo or video. They often come from regular Facebook users instead of Pages or Groups. There is no evidence to support the claim that Sharpton was paid $24,000 to speak at Floyd's funeral. This claim did not originate with a credible source and is not supported by any available evidence. However, we can't definitively say that Sharpton was not paid for this speaking engagement. We reached out to Sharpton and The Fountain of Praise Church in Houston for more information and will update this story if we hear back.

As Chief Resident Dr. Louis Friend characterized the results of the research, \"the less intelligent you are, the more you like Bush.\" This landmark study, conducted over a 5 month period, involved 2400 likely voters bridging all economic stratas in the 17 states generally considered up for grabs on November 2nd.

        "justification": "Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. here During his 2020 presidential campaign, U.S. President Donald Trump on multiple occasions claimed his Democratic opponent Joe Biden would impose the \"biggest tax increase in history\" if voters elected him. In an August interview on Fox News, for instance, Trump said of Democrats: said They want to tax $4 trillion, going to be the biggest tax increase in history by far. It will triple up records, and they're big taxers. It's just something that won't work. We'll have  you will see a depression, the likes of which you have never seen. In the following weeks, he reiterated the claim  that \"you are going to have the tax increase of your life\" if Biden wins the 2020 election  in social media posts and during campaign events, without explaining who would bear the brunt of the alleged hike. Trump tweeted on Oct. 5: tweeted   Below is an analysis of Biden's tax proposal assessing whether it would indeed raise taxes by an amount never seen before in modern U.S. history, and who would most feel its impact. According to his campaign website, Biden ran for president on the promise that he would change multiple aspects of the country's tax system  specifically in regards to individual income and payroll taxes, business taxes, and tax expenditures. campaign website promise The proposed changes would repeal aspects of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the Trump administration and Republicans framed as a solution to fuel economic growth ,and Democrats saw as a gift to the country's richest individuals and large corporations at the expense of low-to-middle-class Americans. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Specifically, Biden's tax plan would roll back the act's income tax reductions for the country's top bracket of taxpayers, as well as expand that category to include Americans with incomes over $400,000 annually, rather than just those who earn more than $518,400. $518,400 His proposal would also require that group of top earners to limit deductions and pay an additional Social Security payroll tax, per an analysis by Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Millionaires and billionaires would be subject to taxes on long-term capital gains at ordinary  not preferential  income tax rates. analysis long-term capital gains Additionally, Biden's plan would increase the top tax rate for corporations from 21% to 28% and impose a 15% minimum tax on companies' book income, according to his campaign website. It would also reduce tax subsidies for commercial real estate and fossil fuels and incentivize renewable energy investments, among other changes. All of that said, the country's richest taxpayers and corporations would cover the majority of Biden's proposed tax increases  not average Americans  both in dollar amounts and as a share of their incomes. But let's look at the anticipated impact at a granular level. All income levels would face some sort of tax burden in 2021 under Biden's plan (we explain more below), though the highest-income households would pay higher income taxes directly and see substantially larger increases than anyone else. Gleckman made the following estimations: His plan would raise taxes on households in the top 1% of the income distribution (those with income more than $837,000) by an average of about $299,000. [...] By contrast, taxpayers in the middle-income quintile (those with income between $52,000 and $93,000) would experience an average tax increase of just $260. [...] Taxpayers in the bottom quintile (those with income less than $26,000) would see an average tax increase of only $30. That added burden on low- and middle-income households representing about 2% of the proposed change  would be an indirect result of employers shifting the cost of the higher corporate tax rate to some workers. Corporations on a grand scale would slightly lower wages and investment income, which would, on average, more than offset the effects of Biden's new tax credits, the center concluded. Alicyn McLeod, a tax adviser and writer for Accounting Today, said in October 2020: Accounting Today Bidens proposal is primarily motivated by fairness. Many U.S. taxpayers are concerned that large corporations arent paying their fair share. While understandable, this position ignores the belief among many tax and economic policy experts that a significant portion of corporate taxes are ultimately paid by workers, shareholders, and consumers as opposed to companies themselves.  In sum, the overwhelming majority of Americans  those who earn $400,000 or less annually  would not see their taxes increase as a direct result of Biden's tax proposal, and the top 1% earners would shoulder the brunt of his proposed hike. But low-to-middle-class workers would see slightly lower investment returns and wages as a result of corporate tax increases, according to economists' analysis including a a budgetary model by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. budgetary model Biden's plan would raise about $3.38 trillion in additional tax revenue over 10 years, according to the university's model. Concurrently, per Gleckman's analysis, that would amount to an increase in federal revenue by about 1.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is the economy's total output of goods and services, and economists rely on it greatly to measure the economy's health and how fiscal or regulatory policies could impact it  not raw dollar amounts that don't consider inflation and population changes. To determine the legitimacy of Trump's claim, we considered federal tax proposals and their impact on GDP over decades. Of almost two dozen congressional tax bills that increased federal tax revenues between 1940 and 2012, for example, the five largest tax increases raised annual revenue between 1.33% and 5.04% of GDP, according to a 2013 compilation of such records by the U.S. Department of Treasury. the U.S. Department of Treasury The following table compiled by the Tax Foundation, another independent public policy think tank, showed where Biden's plan would stand in comparison to those other proposals: Tax Foundation   According to those findings, Biden's tax proposal, if enacted by Congress, would amount to the fifth-largest tax increase since the 1940s  not the biggest hike in modern U.S. history.

            "An offer on Facebook for free ALDI grocery coupons is not legitimate."
        ],
        "justification": "In July 2019, an $80 coupon began making the rounds on Facebook for the ALDI grocery store chain. These shared posts were the latest iteration of the common \"free coupon\" or \"free gift card\" scams that frequently plague social media and have also preyed on shoppers of chains such as Kroger and Target: Kroger Target  A different scam coupon offer also circulated with the ALDI logo in December 2015, advertising a \"get 40% off all purchases in store\" promise. Another displayed what appeared to be a free coupon for \"$60 off a minimum $70 purchase\", and even one for $75 off:  \"Aldi has a coupon for $60 off a minimum $70 purchase. Aldi has verified this is a scam, but people are sharing it all over facebook.\" These coupons are not legitimate, as ALDI themselves noted on their Facebook page:  These coupon offers are a form of survey scams that direct victims to either a survey on an website not owned by ALDI, or what looks like a Facebook page for ALDI. The survey pages nor the Facebook page have any affiliation with the company, despite being adorned with the ALDI logo. Both instruct people to share the bogus ALDI coupon offer on their Facebook timelines and submit comments about it:  This page instructs shoppers to follow these \"two simple steps\" in order to get their coupons. Once the steps are completed, however, users are not greeted with information explaining how to claim their coupons. Instead, they're asked to take a brief survey that entails providing personal information such as home address, telephone number, e-mail address, and date of birth, and are required to sign up for credit cards or enroll in number of subscription programs in order to obtain their \"free\" gift cards:  A version of the scam also surfaced in May 2016, and another later in 2018. ALDI responded to frustrated consumers on Facebook:  In June 2017, a version of the scam touting discounts in honor of ALDI's purported anniversary also appeared on Facebook: \"HEY FRIENDS CHECK THIS OUT!!!!!\nAldi is giving Free $75 Coupon to Everyone to celebrate 103rd Anniversary!\nEach Person (1)- Go & get yours!\nALDI-COM.COM\" However, attempting to visit the linked domain (ALDI-COM.com) led to a \"deceptive site ahead\" warning and not to ALDI's official web site:  If you frequently use Facebook, there is a good chance that you'll run into one of these survey scams again. A July 2014 article from the Better Business Bureau lists key factors for identifying fraudulent Facebook posts: article \"Dont believe what you see. Its easy to steal the colors, logos and header of an established organization. Scammers can also make links look like they lead to legitimate websites and emails appear to come from a different sender. Legitimate businesses do not ask for credit card numbers or banking information on customer surveys. If they do ask for personal information, like an address or email, be sure there's a link to their privacy policy. When in doubt, do a quick web search. If the survey is a scam, you may find alerts or complaints from other consumers. The organization's real website may have further information. Watch out for a reward that's too good to be true. If the survey is real, you may be entered in a drawing to win a gift card or receive a small discount off your next purchase. Few businesses can afford to give away $50 gift cards for completing a few questions.\" All in all, trying to claim that \"free\" deep discount ALDI coupon is likely going to end up costing you a lot more than you'll save. Patterson, Emily.  \"Customer Survey Scam Lures Victims with Gift Card.\" \r\n  Better Business Bureau.  4 July 2014. 10 July 2019: This story has been updated with a scam offer appearing on Facebook that promises $80 off at ALDI.",

        "justification": "In July 2020, a message supposedly written by radio host and financial advisor Dave Ramsey about the dangers of a cashless society went viral on social media. This piece of text typically started with the title \"Here's What No Cash Actually Means\" and a line attributing the message to Ramsey:   A common tactic of purveyors of misinformation is to attach a well-known or well-liked person to an opinion piece in an attempt to give those opinions credence. In this case, Ramsey was attached to this warning about a cashless society in order to lend some authority to this diatribe. Ramsey, however, did not write the above-displayed text. On July 10, 2020, Ramsey took to Twitter to clarify that he had nothing to do with this message. Ramsey exclaimed \"NOT me\" before adding a common and obviously fictitious quote from late U.S. President Abraham Lincoln about believing everything you read on the internet: Twitter    It should also be noted that many of the activities mentioned in this post wouldn't actually be precluded in a cashless society. One could still, for instance, do odd jobs, send money for birthdays, or sell used items for extra money. The nature of these transactions might change (one would have to find a digital solution, such as a pre-paid debit cards or a mobile payment service), but it wouldn't cause these acts to disappear entirely.  Although Ramsey did not write this warning, the financial guru has opined on the idea of a cashless society. When asked about his thoughts on businesses doing away with cash transactions, Ramsey said that it wasn't a topic that caused him much worry: said I really dont spend a lot of time thinking or worrying about the situation. When it comes right down to it, most businesses are doing that for one or two reasons. Some of them just think cash is old school, and they want to give the impression theyre cutting edge and into technology. Others do it, depending upon the space theyre in, because their sales using plastic are higher than with cash. Honestly, I think the whole scenario is kind of silly. Businesses that are suddenly into the no cash thing lose out on a lot of transactions. There are still many people out there who only make purchases with cash. So, from a business owners perspective this philosophy can cut into your market share. Im a cash guy. There are some situations where I might walk away if someone wouldnt accept cash. But in most cases I dont think anything about it. Ill just use my debit card, and buy what I need. It's still unclear who authored this post about a cashless society, but it was not Ramsey.

FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, December  2012] \nIs it true that Shania Twain is Mark Twain's great-granddaughter? \n\n\n\n\n  Origins:  Several well-traveled rumors have posited improbable familial relationships between celebrities based on nothing more than vague facial resemblances, spawning such common legends as those claiming that soap actress Susan Lucci is the daughter of comedienne Phyllis Diller or that western actor Susan Lucci  Clint Eastwood is the son of comic Stan Laurel.   In more recent years we've received a number of similar celebrity inquiries seemingly based on nothing more than the fact that two famous people share a surname, such as this question about whether Canadian country pop star Shania Twain is the great-granddaughter (or other direct relative) of 19th century American author and humorist Mark Twain. Clint Eastwood In this case, however, supposition about one Twain being a descendant of the other immediately falls apart  when one realizes that neither person is a direct biological relative of anyone with the surname of Twain. \"Mark Twain\" was not a real person but rather the pen name of writer Samuel Langhorne Clemens, who was born in Missouri in 1835.  Although the line between Clemens and his alternate persona may have been a bit blurred at times (for example, Clemens delivered humorous\nlectures in character as Mark Twain), he nonetheless retained the use of his birth name in personal matters, and all of his children bore the surname Clemens. lectures \n\n\n\n\n Shania Twain was born  Eilleen Regina Edwards in Windsor, Ontario, in 1965, the daughter of Sharon  Morrison Edwards and Clarence Edwards.  She didn't acquire the last name of Twain until after her parents divorced and her mother married again, to a man named Jerry Twain who adopted Eilleen and her sisters (thus legally changing their surname from Edwards to Twain).   She remained Eilleen Twain until 1991, when she changed her first name to Shania and embarked upon a recording career. Aside from the name issue, the country/pop singer couldn't possibly be a great-granddaughter of the renowned writer and humorist, as the latter had no direct descendants beyond a single now-deceased grandchild.  Samuel Clemens and his wife Olivia Langdon Clemens had four children, a son and three daughters: son Langdon died before his second birthday, daughters Susan and Jean passed away before marrying, and daughter Clara married and bore one child, a daughter named Nina Clemens Gabrilowitsch.  However, Nina died in 1966  without ever having borne any children of her own, and any direct line of descent from Samuel Langhorne Clemens ended with her death.  Any living relatives of \"Mark Twain\" are either in-laws or descendants of other members of his family, not direct relatives. Last updated:  3 December 2012\n ",

            "Is Fuji distributing world maps that omit Israel?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Fuji stores are distributing complimentary world maps that omit Israel. \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2002] \n\n\nFuji Co. removed Israel from its complimentary world map which is distributed to their customers with a purchase. Yes, in Fuji stores abroad you receive the world map without Israel!!! According to Fuji, Israel just doesn't exist. It is most likely done to entice Arab customers. Many Israelis today called for boycott of all Fuji products - film, cameras, batteries etc Luckily - there are alternatives: film - Kodak, Agfa, cameras - Nikon, Olimpus, Samsung, Cannon etc. Do not buy anything made by Fuji and encourage others to do likewise! At least not until they change and apologize. Also important to note - Subaru is Fuji.\n Origins:  E-mails   proclaiming that a particular company has identified Israel as 'Palestine' on a map or directory listing or has omitted Israel entirely  with the purported intent of \"courting Arab business\"  are not uncommon, although such claims generally turn out to be either inaccurate or the result of mistakes rather than malice or greed.  According to Fujifilm, this was yet another example for the \"Inaccurate\" column: inaccurate mistakes \n\nFujifilm Statement re: Map Issue No Fujifilm company or distributor published or distributed a map of the kind we have heard described, and Fujifilm in no way sanctioned the production of such a map. In looking into the matter, we have learned that a third party wholesaler in the Republique de Cote d'Ivoire (the Ivory Coast) produced a calendar with such a map.  They did so on their own initiative, combining the map with our logo without our permission and in violation of our policy regarding the use of the Fujifilm logo. Fujifilm is greatly disturbed that someone would violate our policies and link our company's good name to something we find unacceptable.  As soon as we learned of the problem, corrective action was taken to stop the distribution of these calendars. Fujifilm appreciates the opportunity to share the actual facts of this matter, and to provide every assurance that Fujifilm is a company of the highest stature and integrity.\n (NOTE: Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. is indeed the parent company of Subaru of America, Inc., but despite the similarity in names, it has no affiliation with the Fuji company which manufactures film.) According to JTA, Fujifilm \"says it is very concerned about the issue, and had corporate executives in Japan visit the Israeli consulate there to explain the situation.\" A commercial map which does (as of this writing) omit Israel while including Palestine can be found on the dealer locator map for BMW Middle East. BMW Middle East Last updated:  30 November 2007\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   Berger, Matthew E.  \"Myth About Firms Creating Maps\nWithout Israel Making the Rounds.\"\n   JTA.  28 February 2002.\n\n",

The tweet in question claimed that the Oscars first started providing closed captions in 2021. In truth, the Oscars had been providing closed captioning for decades. Oscars Oscars On March 27, 1982, Wisconsin's Leader-Telegram newspaper published that a brand new way of providing captions during live television would be debuting at that year's Oscars: Leader-Telegram published Oscars A new method for providing closed captioning for hearing-impaired viewers will be unveiled by the National Captioning Institute during ABC-TV coverage of the 54th annual Academy Awards presentations March 29. Called Real Time, the method is a form of electronic computerized shorthand which will allow hearing-impaired viewers to receive closed captions throughout the entire telecast, including acceptance speeches the moment they are spoken. NCI spokesman John E. D. Ball said Real Time involves a courtroom style stenotype machine and a computer capable of transmitting phonetic symbols into words. Twitter user @bubbaprog pointed out that the March 27 tweet from @fondasbian was misleading. \"This tweet has 5,000 retweets and it's completely false,\" @bubbaprog tweeted. \"The Academy Awards were literally the first live program to utilize closed-captioning in 1982 and have been captioned ever since.\" pointed out tweeted It's true that the Oscars had featured closed captions during every ceremony since 1982. However, while the Academy Awards were the first program to utilize closed captions during a live broadcast, similar technology for prerecorded programs (not live) had already been partially implemented two years before. Oscars On March 16, 1980, the Chicago Tribune newspaper published that NBC, ABC, and PBS announced they would begin to \"inaugurate a new service designed to enlarge the world of prime-time TV for Americans with impaired hearing.\" Chicago Tribune published According to the article, programs that received the first closed captions on American television were the \"Wonderful World of Disney,\" ABC's \"Sunday Night Movie,\" \"Eight Is Enough,\" \"Barney Miller,\" \"Masterpiece Theater,\" \"Once Upon a Classic,\" and \"Mystery Theater.\" In sum, no, the Oscars did not wait until 2021 to start providing closed captions. The Academy Award ceremonies had been broadcast with closed captions since 1982 and were the first live program to utilize the technology. Oscars",

Since it's conceivable that he published it then deleted it, we can't reach a definitive conclusion as to whether or not it is genuine. However, there are good reasons to doubt its authenticity. no record Firstly, it is strikingly similar to another tweet which was revealed to have been a hoax in February 2018, after another massive loss for the Dow Jones. On that occasion, Shaun Usher -- who runs the popular \"Letters of Note\" blog -- admitted to having fabricated an \"old Trump tweet\" from 2015, in which the presidential candidate was supposed to have proclaimed:  hoax loss If the Dow Joans [sic] ever falls more than 1000 \"points\" in a Single Day the sitting president should be \"loaded\" into a very big cannon and Shot into the sun at TREMENDOUS SPEED! No excuses!    Secondly, there is no record of the 2012 tweet existing before 11 October 2018. The earliest instance we could find was the purported screenshot posted on that date by Twitter user Travis Allen. Despite searching Twitter and online news archives from 2012 onward, we did not find a single reference to Trump advocating the impeachment of the U.S. president in the event of a significant stock market drop. Twitter Nobody made reference to such a tweet despite almost six years passing -- not even when the Dow Jones dropped 1,175 points on 5 February 2018.  Also, we could find no variances in screenshots of the purported tweet. Every instance shows the same number of retweets and likes, and the same set of thumbnail avatars. Additional screenshots displaying variations in the number of retweets and likes, and/or different avatars, would at least suggest that someone besides Travis Allen had taken note of the tweet and kept a record of it (although that, in itself, would not amount to definitive corroboration).  As it stands, the case for the tweet's authenticity rests entirely on a sole Twitter user (out of hundreds of millions) having taken a screenshot of it between 6 November 2012 and 11 October 2018, before it could have been deleted.  Finally, the person who posted the earliest known instance of the tweet has a history of posting anti-Trump \"sharebait,\" a fact that casts even more reasonable doubt on its authenticity.  Allen's own 11 October tweet implores readers to \"retweet and like to spread this old Trump tweet.\" This effort to garner shares and engagement is a common feature of his Twitter account. In the week leading up to the \"Dow Jones\" screenshot, Allen published nine tweets that included requests that readers share and like his content. For example:  Remember when Trump said he was going to build the Wall and make Mexico pay for it? ??? RT and like if you remember!  Travis Allen ?

(@TravisAllen02) October 5, 2018 October 5, 2018   A pattern of posting partisan sharebait does not prove that Allen's \"Dow Jones\" tweet was fake, but it justifies further skepticism about its authenticity.  We sent Allen a message asking him whether he fabricated the tweet, and, if not, whether he could provide the date on which he captured a screenshot of it, its URL, or an archive link to it.

FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, September 2013] \nIs Kansas really trying to pass a law that would block Cosmos on its stations?\n\n   Origins:  On 7 April 2014,  the National Report published an article positing that Kansas legislators were pondering a bill that would force the Fox television network's science show\nCOSMOS: A Spacetime Odyssey, hosted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, off the air in that state: article COSMOS: A Spacetime Odyssey \n\nThe Fox television show COSMOS: A Spacetime Odyssey has attracted its fair share of detractors since the docudrama first aired on March 9th.  But soon, the controversy revolving around the show might reach climactic new heights, as several State senators in Kansas will propose a bill on Thursday that would force Fox affiliates in their state to black out the science show completely. The bill, which many are expecting will pass, would force local Kansas television stations affiliated with Fox to pay steep fines for airing the program.

The free Dunkin' Donuts offers are a variation of the company anniversary survey scam, a ploy that depends on the unwary unwittingly promoting the phony offer to their social media friends: anniversary survey scam \nThese web pages (which are not operated or sponsored by the companies they reference) typically ask the unwary to click what appear to be Facebook share buttons and post comments to the scammers site (which is really a ruse to dupe users into spreading the scam by sharing it with all of their Facebook friends). Those who follow such instructions are then led into a set of pages prompting them to input a fair amount of personal information (including name, age, address, and phone numbers), complete a lengthy series of surveys, and finally sign up (and commit to paying) for at least two Reward Offers (e.g., Netflix subscriptions, credit report monitoring services, prepaid credit cards).\n A representative for Dunkin' Donuts wrote on the company's official Facebook page that the online \"free dozen\" coupon was not one offered by the chain:   The Better Business Bureau issued guidelines warning specifically of identical scams on Facebook that target shoppers: Dont believe what you see. Its easy to steal the colors, logos and header of an established organization. Scammers can also make links look like they lead to legitimate websites and emails appear to come from a different sender. Legitimate businesses do not ask for credit card numbers or banking information on customer surveys. If they do ask for personal information, like an address or email, be sure theres a link to their privacy policy. When in doubt, do a quick web search. If the survey is a scam, you may find alerts or complaints from other consumers. The organizations real website may have further information. Watch out for a reward thats too good to be true. If the survey is real, you may be entered in a drawing to win a gift card or receive a small discount off your next purchase. Few businesses can afford to give away $50 gift cards for completing a few questions. Legitimate Dunkin' Donuts offers are listed in a Promotions page on the company's website. Promotions",

        "justification": "Social media users love to share words of inspiration and wisdom  if you can pair a profound (or at least vague) life lesson with a striking photo of a celebrity, all the better.  That was the case in early 2018, when a photograph of California's former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared along with an elaborate, but false, back story. A photograph of Schwarzenegger in a sleeping bag in front of a statue of himself bore the following caption: caption Famed actor Arnold Schwarzenegger posted a photo of himself sleeping on the street under his famous bronze statue, and sadly wrote \"How times have changed\"... The reason he wrote the phrase was not only because he was old, but because when he was governor of California he inaugurated a hotel with his statue. Hotel staff told Arnold, \"at any moment you can come and have a room reserved for you.\" when Arnold stepped down as governor and went to the hotel, the administration refused to give him a room arguing that he should pay for it, since they were in great demand. He brought a sleeping bag and stood underneath the statue and explained what he wanted to convey: \"When I was in an important position, they always complimented me, and when I lost this position, they forgot about me and did not keep their promise. Do not trust your position or the amount of money you have, nor your power, nor your intelligence, it will not last. \" Trying to teach everyone that when you're \"Important\" in the people's eyes , everyone is your \"Friend \" But once you don't benefit their interests , you won't matter. \" You are not always who you think you will always be, nothing lasts forever.\"    The story is riddled with falsehoods, and its primary claim  that Schwarzenegger slept outside a hotel after being refused a free room is a fabrication.  In reality, the photograph (which is legitimate) was taken in January 2016, while the Hollywood star was shooting a film in Columbus, Ohio. Schwarzenegger posted it to his Instagram account on 15 January 2016, apparently as a joke: shooting account   The statue is located outside the city's convention center and has never been situated in front of a hotel, despite the false claims in the Facebook post.  located Schwarzenegger first helped unveil the statue in 2012, outside the Franklin County Veterans Memorial, and then took part in its rededication in 2014, after it was moved to its current location.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ADVISE EVERYONE YOU KNOW THAT THEY ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT GO TO THE POLLS WEARING ANY OBAMA SHIRTS, PINS OR HATS, IT IS AGAINST THE LAW AND WILL BE GROUNDS TO HAVE THE POLLING OFFICIALS TO TURN YOU AWAY.

THEY ARE BANKING THAT IF ARE TURNED AWAY YOU WILL NOT GO HOME AND CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES.. PLEASE JUST DON'T WEAR OBAMA GEAR OF ANY SORTS TO THE POLLS!! PLEASE SHARE THIS INFORMATION, OH AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE ALREADY AWARE THIS WAS NOT MEANT TO INSULT YOUR INTELLIGENCE. JUST TRYING TO COVER ALL GROUNDS.\n Origins:  Election laws and regulations in the U.S. typically prohibit the practice of \"electioneering\" (actively supporting a candidate, political party, or issue) within or near polling places.  Such rules have generally been applied to prevent overt electioneering: posting signs or banners; passing out pamphlets, flyers, or other literature; making oral exhortions, etc.  Recently, however, movements in some states have sought to have bans on electioneering enforced against \"passive electioneering\" as  well  the wearing by voters of buttons, pins, hats, t-shirts, and other adornments bearing the names of candidates. The issue is a murky one without any definitive answer because laws vary from state to state, state laws may prohibit electioneering without defining the term, and the definition of \"electioneering\" can vary from place to place within a state when the issue is left up to local election boards to define, as is currently the case in Pennsylvania: \n\nIn  past years, some local election officials across Pennsylvania have enforced the provision [against passive electioneering], going as far as asking voters to turn their T-shirts inside out. But this year, the Rendell administration has softened its stance on the issue. The ACLU and the League of Women Voters asked the Pennsylvania Department of State to weigh in on the topic, believing that preventing voters from wearing T-shirts with a candidate's name on it infringes on their freedom of speech. Department of State officials sent letters to the state's 67 county boards of elections advising them that, although state law bans electioneering inside a polling place, it doesn't define what the term means. Merely wearing shirts and buttons doesn't constitute electioneering as long as no other attempts to influence voters are made, the memo said. In short, the state is letting the county boards of elections decide whether to police what people wear.\n Even when state officials try to clarify electioneering rules, the results can be a tangle of contradictory information: \n\n[Kentucky] State Board of Elections attorney Katie Gabhart said the First Amendment right to free speech dictates that voters can wear what they want. But she warned that local authorities could try to press charges if someone were dressed like \"a walking placard.\" A Kentucky attorney general's opinion issued in 1992 said the First Amendment allows voters to wear T-shirts, buttons and other accessories. State Board of Elections Executive Director Sarah Ball Johnson said her agency still considers that opinion relevant. Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson, the state's top election official, said he would advise people not to wear campaign paraphernalia to avoid violating the law against campaigning at the polls.\n Electioneering regulations apply to more than just items that display candidates' names.  When voters in North Texas cast votes in 2004 with a ballot that included a measure on whether taxpayers should help fund the construction of a new $650 million stadium in Arlington for the Dallas Cowboys football team, they were cautioned not to wear apparel displaying the Cowboys logo or team colors to polling places: \n\nA warning to Dallas Cowboys fans who plan to vote in the North Texas city of Arlington: Leave your team colors at home. The Cowboys may be known as \"America's Team,\" but polling places are no place for fan gear, election officials say  at least not this year. Elections administrator Robert Parten said that voters sporting Cowboys logos at Arlington polling sites will be told to cover up their allegiance to the team if they want to cast ballots. He said he ordered the prohibition because of a provision on the Arlington ballot that asks whether taxpayers should help pay for a $650 million Cowboys stadium in their city. \"Anytime you go into a polling place and what you're wearing shows something that's on the ballot, that's electioneering,\" Gayle Hamilton, assistant elections administrator for Tarrant County, said.\n It's up to voters to be aware of what the regulations are at their local polling places; if you can't get (or don't have time to find) a definitive answer about what constitutes electioneering where you vote, you may want to leave apparel (or other decorative items) bearing the names of candidates home on election day, or at least be prepared to remove it if asked.  (For example, if you're going to wear an \"Obama\" or \"McCain\" shirt to a polling place, be sure to bring some other clothing you can change into or cover up with just in case.)  In general, you should not be denied permission to vote for violating passive electioneering regulations; you should just be asked to leave the polling place and remove the items in question from public view before you re-enter. (Electioneering can be a violation of state law, typically a misdemeanor, so perpetrators run the risk of being detained and/or arrested, but this outcome is unlikely save for cases of repeated or flagrant violations.)

The volunteer workers and netizens raised more than NT$50,000 donations online for the expenses for its two-month long medical treatment. ARTT put Adam's story on Petfinders, a leading Web site for pet adoption in the U.S.; the post topped the most-read chart on the site for two weeks. \"I just needed something to need me; I have my heart for him regardless what scars he has,\" said Erin Zickenberg, who decided to welcome Adam into her family during the Christmas season, when she described as a particularly painful time for her to face her husband's death. The match was not only a new form of life for Zickenberg, but also for Adam, which just got a new name, Lucky, from its foster parent, because \"he is a lucky dog to have been rescued and taken care of by the rescue project in Taiwan.\" According to Zickenberg, Lucky is well trained and weighs 20 pounds, 6 pounds more than he weighed a month ago. Zickenberg appreciated all the love and help that had been given to Lucky, who is now a healthy and happy dog.\n A photograph of Lucky with his adoptive owner can be viewed here. here Last updated:  8 February 2012\n ",

        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  Educational materials publisher Pearson monitored students' social media accounts for content related to the PARCC test. MIXTURE:   \nFALSE: Pearson monitored individual, private student accounts to circumvent cheating on PARCC tests.\n\n  \n\nTRUE: Pearson monitored social media networks for public posts that possibly disclosed test contents.\n  Example:  [Collected via e-mail, March 2015] \nThis was posted on FaceBook.  It stated that Pearson was monitoring\nstudents' social media after a student tweeted about a PARCC test\nquestion.\n\n\n   Origins:  On 13 March 2015, the Facebook page \"Bob Braun's ledger\" (operated by a former newspaper reporter named Bob Braun) published two status updates about a leaked e-mail message from Superintendent Elizabeth Jewett of Watchung Hills Regional High School District in New Jersey.  That e-mail referenced a \"Priority 1 Alert for an item breach\" that test and textbook manufacturer Pearson had initiated with the New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE) over a student's possible social media posting of a test question from the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) test, and it also expressed Jewett's concerns that Pearson was surveilling the social media accounts of students taking test:   published \n\nLast night at 10PM, my testing coordinator received a call from the NJDOE that Pearson had initiated a Priority 1 Alert for an item breach within our school. The information the NJDOE initially called with was that there was a security breach DURING the test session, and they suggested the student took a picture of a test item and tweeted it. After further investigation on our part, it turned out that the student had posted a tweet (NO PICTURE) at 3:18PM (after school) that referenced a PARCC test question. The student deleted the tweet and we spoke with the parent  who was obviously highly concerned as to her child's tweets being monitored by the DOE. The DOE informed us that Pearson is monitoring all social media during PARCC testing. I have to say that I find that a bit disturbing  and if our parents were concerned before about a conspiracy with all of the student data, I am sure I will be receiving more letters of refusal once this gets out (not to mention the fact that the DOE wanted us to also issue discipline to the student).\n\n Braun's post (and a subsequent article) drew widespread attention and prompted debate about student privacy. On 14 March 2015, Superintendent Elizabeth Jewett of Watchung Hills Regional High School District in New Jersey published a letter confirming that the leaked e-mail circulated by Braun was authentic. Jewett said that she did not authorize the widespread release of the message and was unsure about how and why it was forwarded to Braun: article published \n\nDear Watchung Hills Regional High School Learning Community, On Friday, March 13, 2015, Bobbraunsledger.com published a story referencing an email I had sent to other superintendents about issues regarding PARCC testing and Pearson's monitoring of social media. The email shown in his article is authentic. It was an email I sent on March 10, 2015 at approximately 10:00AM to a group of superintendents to share my concerns and to see if other schools had a similar experience. I did not authorize the release of this email nor am I aware of who did release it. I am also not aware of the motives they may have had behind the release. That said, I completely stand behind my comments as they represent not only my views and concerns; they also represent the views and concerns of our Board of Education. The article references instances involving students during PARCC testing and any related disciplinary action. For student privacy issues, we cannot comment on any of the specific students or discipline referred to in the article. What I am able to share is that all issues have been dealt with in accordance with our Code of Conduct, Academic Integrity and Acceptable Use of Technology Policies. Our main concern is, and will always remain, supporting the educational, social and emotional needs of our students. The privacy and security of student information remains the utmost priority for our district. The district will have no further comment on this matter at this time.\n The claims about PARCC test content and social media monitoring alarmed a number of parents, many of whom were concerned that their children's social media accounts were subject to invasive, secret audits by a large educational testing company. However, much of the controversy boiled down to an initial lack of detail in the retelling regarding  the privacy level of content shared to social media. Upon later examination, it became clear that Pearson was monitoring social networks (primarily Twitter) for public tweets that potentially included content from PARCC tests. Irrespective of whether folks find that specific protocol acceptable, Pearson was not implicated in the interception of any private social media postings or communications belonging to students who were administered PARCC tests. Some parents expressed concern about how Pearson and/or the New Jersey DOE was able to track a tweet to a specific student, assuming that such an act required one of those entities to have invasive access to students' personal social media accounts.  But that assumption is not necessarily true: the content of tweet in question might very well have included information that readily identified the particular student who posted and/or his school affiliation.  (Since the tweet itself was not made public, it's impossible to tell.) A Pearson  representative released a statement after Jewett's e-mail circulated, confirming that social media monitoring pertained only to information published publicly on the internet: \n\nThe security of a test is critical to ensure fairness for all students and teachers and to ensure that the results of any assessment are trustworthy and valid. We welcome debate and a variety of opinions. But when test questions or elements are posted publicly to the Internet, we are obligated to alert PARCC states. Any contact with students or decisions about student discipline are handled at the local level. We believe that a secure test maintains fairness for every student and the validity, integrity of the test results.\n Scott Norton, Strategic Initiative Director for Standards, Assessment and Accountability at the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), concurred with Pearson: \n\nA critical part of giving a high-quality assessment is making sure the test questions are secure so all students take a fair, valid and reliable test. One of the ways test security can be compromised is throughthe sharing of test questions on public forums such as social media. It is up to each state to make sure it has the necessary protocols and processes in place to keep its statewide assessment secure.\n\n Although the security measures cited were adapted to include social media networks, the overall practice of stringent test security for statewide materials is neither new nor novel. New York state's long-term efforts to secure its Regents exams [PDF] is a well-documented example of such measures, as revealed when controversy erupted in June 1989 after the secrecy of the statewide standardized Chemistry test was compromised and its answers were published in a newspaper: PDF \n\nState education officials said that The Post's front page, which displayed the answer sheet, appeared to have been sent by facsimile machines this morning to some students in upstate New York and that this led to the decision for a statewide ban. The chemistry test was to have been given this afternoon. A spokesman for State Attorney General Robert Abrams said investigators were aware of \"at least four tests and their answers having been bought and sold\" among students. In addition to chemistry, the tests were in United States history, global studies and 10th-grade mathematics, said the spokesman, Timothy Gilles. Education officials, who said they had no idea how the keys were obtained, pledged an overhaul of security procedures for administering the tests, which in their 111 years have been canceled statewide only once before.\n Despite the initial controversy, Pearson was not accused of monitoring individual Twitter or Facebook accounts and merely accessed publicly-posted information visible to anyone with an Internet connection. Moreover, standardized testing-based security measures existed well before Twitter and Facebook, and students have long been subject to scrutiny and security measures to circumvent cheating on statewide tests. It didn't appear any students were specifically targeted in larger social media monitoring for PARCC test content, which included only publicly-available posts that were turned up through keyword searches.

The top and bottom of the suggestions settings. Regarding the latter setting, Discoverable by Others, in February 2024 it became the subject of a viral Facebook rumor. A search of Facebook for the words \"Journaling Suggestions\" found no shortage of scared users warning their friends of the purported threat posed by the privacy setting. search  Those users commonly shared an image that displayed the following text: ALERT. If you have an iPhone, this is important! After my latest update, there was a new feature downloaded called \"Journaling,\" and it's under \"Settings,\" \"Privacy and Security\" and then scroll all the way down and there's a new \"feature\" called \"Journaling Suggestions.\" Look for the \"DISCOVERABLE BY OTHERS\" toggle. I bet it's toggled to ON, and it let's anyone near you know your FULL NAME and EXACTLY where you're geo located. Go toggle that OFF!! I'm typing all of this. This is messed up big time. Share with your friends if they're iPhone. Very scary stuff!! PSA ... CHECK YOUR IPHONES. However, this Facebook rumor was false. This was nothing more than the latest rumor about iPhone privacy settings to lead a long scrolling of commenters to say that they're going to turn the setting off \"just to be safe.\" Just two inches above the same Discoverable by Others toggle that so many users were choosing to manually disable, Apple included a link that led to more information on a page named \"Journaling Suggestions & Privacy.\" page On that page, Apple specified that suggestions for the Journal app use Bluetooth  a short-range communication method. Also, the technology \"[detects] the number of devices and contacts around you without storing which of these specific contacts were around.\" In other words, there was no indication that strangers would be allowed to see a name or track a person's location. The page read as follows: Nearby People Journaling Suggestions may also use contextual information to determine which suggestions may be more meaningful or relevant to you. Journaling Suggestions uses Bluetooth to detect the number of devices and contacts around you without storing which of these specific contacts were around. This information is used to improve and prioritize your suggestions. It is stored on device, and is not shared with Apple. You can choose not to allow Journaling Suggestions to use the number of devices and contacts around you to prioritize your suggestions by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Journaling Suggestions, then tapping to turn off Prefer Suggestions with Others. You can also control whether your contacts include you in their number of nearby contacts by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Journaling Suggestions, then tapping to turn off Discoverable by Others. If you disable Discoverable by Others and choose not to be included in your contacts' counts, Prefer Suggestions with Others will also be disabled and Journaling Suggestions will not detect how many devices and contacts are around you to improve or prioritize your suggestions. Snopes emailed Apple to ask about this rumor and will update this story if we receive a response.

            "Can you call a phone number to prevent the four major U.S. credit bureaus from selling your information?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  The four major U.S. credit bureaus will be allowed to share your private information with anyone who requests it as of 1 July 2003 unless you specifically request them not to. \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2001] \n\n\nJust wanted to let everyone know who hasn't already heard, the four major credit bureaus in the US. will be allowed, starting July 1, to release your credit info, mailing addresses, phone numbers etc. to anyone who requests it. If you would like to 'opt out' of this release of info, you can call 1-888-567-8688. It only takes a couple of minutes to do, and you can take care of anyone else in the household while making only one call, you'll just need to know their social security number. Be sure to listen closely, the first opt out is only for two years, make sure you wait until they prompt you to press '3' on your keypad to opt out for good.\n\n\n Origins:  There is truth in the issue which seems to be uppermost in the minds of most of those who receive this message  that is, whether the phone number provided above is valid for the stated purpose or whether it's some sort of information-collecting scam.  The phone number listed (1-888-5OPTOUT) is indeed legitimate; it is a shared number set up with the cooperation of the Associated Credit Bureaus to establish a single point of contact for consumers to call to request that all four major U.S. credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, Trans Union, and Novus/Innovis) remove their information from the marketing lists and pre-approved credit offer lists sold to third parties.  Yes, they automated system will ask you to enter your phone number, Social Security number, and other personal information, because it needs that information to locate your record.  If you are uncomfortable supplying this information to an automated system, you will have to call each of the four major credit bureaus individually and speak to real people at each one of them, a cumbersone and time-consuming ' process. However, it is not true that consumers must call this number before 1 July 2004, nor is it true that recent legislation allows credit bureaus to share private information with \"anyone who requests it.\"  This misinformation has been circulating since 2001, and the same message keeps getting get dusted off and sent around every year with an updated deadline.  (In fact, if you call the number listed above, the first option you're presented is to listen to a message explaining why the e-mail quoted above is false.) Contrary to the text of the dire warning quoted above, credit bureaus cannot sell your non-public personal information (e.g., Social Security number, employment history, bank account information) to \"anyone who requests it.\"  Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1997, businesses seeking to obtain personal information from credit bureaus must have a \"permissible purpose\" in order to access credit reports.  (Permissible purposes include checking the backgrounds of persons to determine their creditworthiness before selling or renting property to them, extending them loans or credit, or considering them for employment.)  This restriction remains in force, it did not change on 1 July 2001, and it still applies whether or not you call the number listed above.    Credit bureaus can, however, create lists containing the names, addresses, and phone numbers of consumers with good credit and sell them to telemarketers and direct-mail marketers.  (Names, addresses, and phone numbers are not considered \"non-public personal information\" because they may be obtained from a variety of publicly-accessible sources, such as phone directories.) Consumers may call the 1-888-5OPTOUT number to request that all four major credit bureaus not include their information on these marketing lists.  There is no deadline for this process  consumers may call the number at any time. What did change back in 2001 was that due to the implementation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act) the banking, insurance, and securities industries were allowed to operate under the same corporate affiliation.  (This act set aside legislation passed during the Depression era, which had created legal barriers to prevent mergers between banks, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and other financial institutions.)   Because of consumers' concerns that new financial conglomerates allowed under this legislation might pool their resources to compile huge databases of sensitive customer information and share them with third parties, Congress added a provision to the act requiring that all financial service companies send privacy notices providing a \"reasonable opportunity\" for their customers to opt out of this information-sharing by 1 July 2001.  (These notices had to provide consumers with details about all the kinds of information the companies collected about them and how they used that information.)  The 1 July 2001 deadline applied only to the sending of notification to customers by financial institutions, and it had nothing to do with credit bureaus.  Some key points of this \"opt-out\" process are: \n Unlike credit bureaus, financial institutions can share your private information with third parties by default.  In order to stop this sharing, you must specifically invoke your \"opt-out\" privileges to request that they not do it.  Privacy notices had to be sent to customers by 1 July 2001, but there is no deadline by which customers must respond.  Your right to \"opt out\" of the information-sharing process is ongoing and may be invoked at any time.  Most importantly, you must contact every financial institution with which you do business to completely \"opt out\" of the information-sharing process.  The phone number given in the message quoted above (1-888-5OPTOUT) applies only to credit bureaus. Calling this number will not affect the ability of any banks, insurance companies, credit card companies, brokerage firms, or any other financial institutions with which you do (or have done) business from sharing your information.\n The bottom line is that laws regarding the selling of personal information by financial institutions have become more stringent recently, not less.  The changes may not have made the laws as stringent as we'd like them to be, but at least they're a step in the right direction, not the scare stories these messages make them out to be.

Someone just suggested to me a televised \"freedom concert\" to air at the same time as the inauguration  with huge celebrities like Beyonc and Jay Z, Madonna, Katy Perry, Justin Timberlake, Gaga, Bruce Springsteen, and so on. Alec Baldwin MCs the event, playing Trump as he does on SNL. Presto. The Trump inauguration loses all the TV ratings. Basically, no one watches it.

        "justification": "On July 5, 2021, the U.S. women's soccer team defeated Mexico 4-0 in their final match before the Olympic Games. While many cheered America's accomplishment, conservative commentators started to share a video along with the claim that the team had \"disrespected\" the 98-year-old World War II veteran, Pete DuPr, who performed the national anthem on his harmonica.  The controversy was a bit unclear from the start. Dinesh D'Souza, for instance, claimed that the players had turned their backs on the veteran during the performance. Richard Grenell, former acting director of U.S. national intelligence, claimed that they turned their back on the flag.  Dinesh D'Souza Richard Grenell,   Both of these messages (as well as the articles, videos, and additional tweets pushing this claim) mischaracterized the actions of the U.S. women's soccer team.  While the video (below) does appear to show some awkward positioning (some players were facing forward while some were facing to the side), this was not a protest or a gesture of disrespect against the flag or the veteran. When DuPr began his performance, some players opted to face him, while others turned to face an American flag at the end of the stadium.  When you watch the video below, pay attention to the direction the audience members were facing behind DuPr . Many of them were angled away from the harmonica-playing veteran and toward a flag at the end of the stadium. This is the same direction that the players were facing. As the flag is a bit difficult to see in the video (since it is only shown at the far-end of the field), here's a photograph from sports reporter Jeff Kassouf that shows the location of the flag for reference: photograph from sports reporter Jeff Kassouf  Here's a video of DuPr's performance of the National Anthem from ESPN:  Many of the people claiming that the U.S. team \"disrespected\" this veteran or the flag noted that the Mexican team was facing forward. It's worth noting that the members of Mexico's soccer team were facing their flag (in the same direction as the U.S. players) when the national anthem of Mexico was played.     The claim that the U.S. Soccer team disrespected this veteran is also contradicted by the fact that the players signed a ball for DuPr after his performance. Meghan Rapinoe, for example, who can be seen in the video facing toward the flag, not DuPr, can be glimpsed in this video signing a ball for the veteran:   Some U.S. soccer players, such as midfielder Cari Lloyd, have also disputed this claim on social media:  The U.S. soccer team also posted a statement on Twitter:  The claim that the U.S. women's soccer team was protesting during veteran DuPr's National Anthem performance is not true. The players did not turn away from this veteran. They turned toward the U.S. flag. ",

The caption for one of the ads read, \"They're Closing Doors in 2024. These Fast Food Restaurant Chains Are Closing The Doors In 2024.\"  Another ad with a picture of a Chick-fil-A restaurant read, \"Restaurant Chains Closing. It's Time To Say Goodbye, These Restaurants Be Closing The Doors.\"  We found several other variations of similar ads that made the same claim about Chick-fil-A's supposed future plans. Some of the ads said said the company would be closing up shop in 2023.  All of these ads were false. It was not true that Chick-fil-A was going to be closing all of its locations, going bankrupt or going out of business for other reasons. An April 2023 report from QSR Magazine detailed the chicken sandwich company's strong financial earnings. QSR Magazine All of the ads led to a lengthy article on Reference.com with the headline, \"These 53 Restaurant Chains Are on the Brink of Disappearing Entirely.\" In the article's page source code, we noted that the story was perhaps written during or before the year 2020 and was last republished in 2021. In other words, the article that was being advertised in December 2023 was two or more years old. article The article listed nearly 70 businesses, most of which appeared to be American brands. Under each business name were several paragraphs describing whether the companies would be closing some or all of its locations. Nowhere in the nearly 70-slide article was Chick-fil-A mentioned even once. The ads with the photos of Chick-fil-A restaurant locations were false and misleading clickbait that may have originally been created to entice readers to scroll or click through the slides, all for nothing. The reason why these kinds of ads and articles exist is usually something called advertising arbitrage. Advertising arbitrage is a strategy in which an advertiser hopes to make more money on ads displayed in a lengthy article than it would cost to display an initial clickbait ad meant to attract users to the article. In other words, instead of the ads being both attractive and potentially helpful to consumers, they instead mislead users from the start. Advertising arbitrage We reached out to Chick-fil-A's media relations team by email to ask if it had a statement to share regarding the false and misleading ads and will update this story if we receive a response.

            "Does the title of the Doors song 'Five to One' refer to the ratio of Viet Cong to American troops in Vietnam?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  The title of the Doors song \"Five to One\" refers to the ratio of Viet Cong to American troops in Vietnam. \nStatus:  Undetermined.\n Origins:  Back when I held a job with my hometown newspaper, we used to receive our share of fractious letters from disgruntled readers who   disagreed with the paper's editorial stances.  Crank letters (usually of the unsigned variety) are a common occurrence at all newspapers, and they were rarely a cause for concern to us unless they contained something beyond the occasional anonymous, vaguely-worded threat. In the category of \"unusual missives,\" though, nothing during my tenure at the newspaper topped the morning we came into work and found that someone had left a note outside our front door during the night, a note whose most remarkable aspect was that it had arrived attached to the antlers of a moose head.  (This being southern California, of course, the delivered moose head was one that had long ago been subject to the taxidermist's art, not a fresh sort one might expect to be placed in a bed at the behest of a Canadian mafia don.)  The note read simply: \"No one here gets out alive\"  a message that caused great consternation among the middle-aged management staff until one of my younger co-workers filled them in that it was line from a Doors song, as well as the title of a recently-published biography of Jim Morrison. Song lyric or not, the message sounded ominous out of context and was taken seriously by the newspaper's management.   It was hard to fault my employers for seemingly attaching too much importance to a fragment of a 1960s' song lyric, because it sounded just as ominous in context, as part of the song \"Five to One\" from the Doors' third album, 1968's \"Waiting for the Sun.\"  The album was cobbled together under pressure when efforts to record Jim Morrison's epic poem \"Celebration of the Lizard,\" which was to have taken up one whole side of the LP, failed to come to fruition.  (The poem itself was printed on the inside of the album's gatefold cover, but only a brief fragment appeared on the record itself.)  The scramble for suitable material resulted in an album that was far less mysterious, dark, and brooding than the group's first two efforts, resulting in a record with its fair share of gentle, melodic tracks  (e.g., \"Love Street,\" \"Wintertime Love\") that led some critics to complain the Doors had \"gone soft.\" In this context, then, the harrowing, anthemic \"Five to One,\" sung by an obviously drunk Morrison (his voice cracks, he hiccups in the middle of a line, and he doesn't keep time with the band for much of the song) was particularly disturbing.  As one fan later described his first experience with the song: \n\nI remember the first time I heard 'Five to One' right after it came out. I happened to put the record on at 3:00 AM one morning, and that song scared the shit out of me. This was supposed to be the Doors' teenybopper album, but that didn't sound like bubblegum music to me.\n\n What made the song so fearsome?  What was it about?  Therein lies the mystery.  As Jim Morrison sang: \n\n\n\nFive to one, baby;\none in five.\nNo one here\ngets out alive.\nNow, you get yours, baby;\nI'll get mine.\nGonna make it, baby,\nif we try. The old get old,\nand the young get stronger;\nmay take a week,\nand it may take longer.\nThey got the guns,\nbut we got the numbers.\nGonna win, yeah;\nWe're takin' over.\nCome on!\n The Doors are often lumped into a \"drugs and politics\" category with other bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s, but although Jim Morrison referred to the group as \"erotic politicians,\" their music was remarkably apolitical.  (\"The Unknown Soldier,\" an anti-war song which appeared on the same album as \"Five to One,\" was the only overtly political statement in the band's canon.)  Nonetheless, back in 1968 \"Five to One\" seemed militant in tone, a call for the overthrow of a vastly outnumbered group.  But who was to be overthrown, and by whom?  What did the five to one ratio of represent? The Unknown Soldier One of the more common interpretations was that \"Five to One\" was about the Vietnam War, the title a reference to the oft-repeated statistic that the Viet Cong forces outnumbered American troops by a ratio of five to one: outnumbered \n\nIn November 1965, just months after President Lyndon Johnson had escalated U.S. involvement in Vietnam, 450 members of the air cavalry were sent into the la Drang Valley in the Central Highlands to ferret out Viet Cong troops that had retreated to the nearby mountains.  On the ground, [Lt. Col. Hal] Moore and his second-in command, Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley, were soon aware that the Americans were outnumbered five to one.\n Others read the song as a call for social revolution, an exhortation to overthrow the establishment inspired by events such as the May 1968 student riots in France. In this version, five to one refers to the bulging proportion of \"young people\" to \"old people\" brought about  student riots by the post-WW II baby boom, hence the song's declaration that \"the old get old, and the young get stronger.\"  (Similarly, the numbers were sometimes claimed be reflective of the proportion of dope smokers to \"straights\" in the population.)  Another popular reading had \"Five to One\" as Morrison's sympathetic nod to the mid-1960s Black Power movement, whose constituency was a minority group comprising only one-sixth of the U.S. population and were hence outnumbered by non-blacks by a five-to-one ratio.  (Actually, in the mid-1960s the percentage of blacks in the U.S. population was several points lower than one-sixth). Black Power What's the answer?  Most likely Morrison selected the song's title not because it echoed a ratio that had any particular referent, but simply because he liked the sound and meter of the phrases \"five to one\" and \"one in five.\"  The mocking final verse of \"Five to One\" indicates that he probably had no specific group in mind when he wrote the lyrics; that in general, as Doors song explicator Chuck Crisafulli noted, Morrison \"seemed to be interested in revolution but at the same time disgusted by the revolutionaries\": \n\n\nYour ballroom days are over, baby;\nnight is drawing near.\nShadows of the evening\ncrawl across the years.\nYa walk across the floor\nwith a flower in your hand,\ntrying to tell me\nno one understands.\nTrade in your hours\nfor a handful dimes;\ngonna make it, baby,\nin our prime.\n\n\n The secret of \"Five to One\" died with Jim Morrison, for the singer never told anyone  not even his bandmates  what he was protesting or what the titular ratio represented.  Unless, as rumor has it, Mr. Mojo Risin' faked his death in Paris in 1971 and shed his identity to lead a life incognito, the meaning \"Five to One\" will forever remain a mystery.

        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  President Obama issued a 'gag order' on insurance rates for 2015 until after the midterm elections. FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, November 2014] \nBarack Obama has issued a GAG ORDER to the health insurance industry instructing them not to disclose their January 2015 health\ninsurance rates until after the mid-term elections.\n\n   Origins: Late on 3 November 2014 (the eve of 2014's midterm elections), blog The Gateway Pundit published an article  article which claimed President Barack Obama issued a \"gag order\" on insurance companies prohibiting them from releasing 2015 insurance rates until the 2014 midterm elections had concluded. The claim came hours before polls officially opened for voting in jurisdictions across the United States. According to the blog, several sources confirmed a conspiracy among Democrats was underway to conceal what are presumably massive health insurance rate hikes in 2015. Quoting blogger Warner Todd Huston, the report stated \"Barack Obama is again playing political games with our health insurance industry,\" and the President \"turned in another underhanded move against it by forcing insurance carriers, brokers and agents to withhold their 2015 prices until after the 2014 midterm elections are over all so that the news of higher prices won't hurt Democrats on Election Day\": \n\nBefore we get into that, though, millions of new cancellations will be hitting on January 1, 2015. Much of this news has gone under the radar as Democrats and their lapdog media are keeping this as quiet as possible. There is also something different with these cancellations, something that has never happened before in the healthcare insurance industry. Past practice has always been that the next year's new rates are released 60 days before the first day of the next year. But Obama has mandated that companies hold back on that normal practice so that he can shield Democrats at the polls.\n The article cited the same source twice (making it seem as if the claim came from more than one place) and the initial claim stemmed from a the personal blog of a health insurance broker who wrote: blog \n\nThis year, for the first time in 20 years I can not even quote a replacement product because Barack Obama has issued a GAG ORDER to the health insurance industry instructing them not to disclose their January 2015 health insurance rates until after the mid-term elections. This is unprecedented. Normally health insurance premiums are released for public viewing 60 days before the January 1st effective date. Where are the reports on these cancellations and the gag order from NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN? The only news organization that I am aware of that has reported on any of this is the Fox News channel. I can guarantee you one thing, not one of my clients who received a cancellation notice is voting Democrat on Tuesday.\n\n It's worth noting the claims bear a striking resemblance to a similar (false) claim that 2015 Medicare rates had been deliberately withheld from Medicare enrollees until the elections had concluded. In that case, Medicare rates were released following the printing of the 2015 Medicare handbook but were made widely available well in advance of the 2014 midterm elections. Contrary to the rumor, 2015 Medicare rates were essentially the same as those for 2014. Medicare In this case, the original claim stemmed from an opinion piece from USA Today penned by health insurance pundit Bob Laszewski and published on 13 October 2014. In that editorial, Laszewski surmised the Obama administration was attempting to circumvent a backlash by restricting information related not to insurance rates, but to enrollment data:  \n\nLast week, The Wall Street Journal reported that the administration sent an email to the insurance companies participating in Obamacare telling them to keep their mouths shut about the testing of the new health law's enrollment system saying, that unlike last year, they would require \"all testers (the insurance companies) to acknowledge the confidentiality of this process\" before they would be allowed to participate. The administration reminded insurers that their confidentiality agreement with the Obama administration means that insurance executives \"will not use, disclose, post to a public forum, or in any way share Test Data with any person or entity, included but not limited to media ...\" This includes any \"results of this testing exercise and any information describing or otherwise relating to the performance or functionality\" of the Obamacare enrollment and eligibility system.\n\n The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report to which that editorial referred was published on 7 October 2014, and pertained (again) not to the disclosure of insurance rates, but rather to the testing of a new version of the Healthcare.gov website. The WSJ reported an \"email alert\" had been sent to insurance industry participants instructing them not to divulge website testing data or functionality information to media sources: \n\nThe email alert spells out exactly what is expected of participants: Insurance-industry officials \"will not use, disclose, describe, post to a public form, or in any way share Test Data with any person or entity, including but not limited to the media,\" unless the recipient also has agreed to the confidentiality provisions. The new confidentiality agreement won't just cover the industry data that will be included in the marketplace's testing environment. It also includes \"results of this testing exercise and any information describing or otherwise relating to the performance or functionality\" of HealthCare.gov. A spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans said, the insurers \"engaged in testing are focused on avoiding the unfortunate experience that consumers faced last year and nothing more.\"\n Clearly there was no industry-wide \"gag order\" that precluded all insurers from disclosing their 2015 health insurance rates prior to the 2014 midterm elections, as a number of insurance companies sent out printed materials to customers listing those future rates well before the early November election date. Also at issue was the fact that back in November 2013, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) opted to push the start of the 2015 enrollment period for federal health-care exchanges back from mid-October 2014 to mid-November 2014, a move some critics cited as an attempt to prevent bad news about rate increases from coming out prior to the mid-term elections in November 2014.  HHS maintained the change in schedule was made to allow insurance companies more time review the previous year's enrollments before setting their rates for the upcoming year and to provide more time for potential customers to make their enrollment choices: \n\nThe change is aimed at giving insurance companies who offer plans on the exchanges more time to review 2014 enrollments and set rates for the 2015 enrollment period. It would also give customers an extra week to review their options, extending the open-enrollment period by one week to two full months. Republicans were quick to pounce on the change, accusing the administration of a blatantly political effort to delay bad news that might result from the next round of open enrollment until after the election. The delay means Americans might not hear about potential rate increases until after the election, rather than in the weeks before.\n The shift in the open enrollment period for 2015 meant that many consumers who obtain insurance through the federal exchanges might not have looked for or been aware of newer rates (and potential rate increases) until after the 2014 midterm elections, but insurance companies were not precluded by presidential order from making that information available to the public.

The Walker family checked into the hospital knowing they would not be going home with baby Grayson James Walker. \"At first, I questioned God and wondered why he would choose us for this,\" said Heather Walker. Sixteen weeks into her pregnancy, Heather Walker found out her baby had  a fatal birth defect. \"It's known as Anecephaly, and this is one of the variations of what we call an open neural tube defect,\" said the family's doctor Roy Bors-Koefoed, M.D. \"The risk of Anecephaly is about one in 1,000 in the general population\", added Bors-Koefoed.  They of course gave us the option to terminate,\" said Heather Walker. The Walkers chose to carry Grayson to full term.  Heather Walker said she turned to her faith to prepare herself for the days ahead. \"My husband and I, we started prayer and we knew that God knew since the beginning of time that he had us for this,\" said Heather Walker. \"Honestly, just seeing the strength that she had motivated me to be a better husband and a better father to my kids,\" said Patrick Walker. Fighting through her fears, Heather Walker talked to her children about Grayson and said she wanted to keep the experience joyful. \"As soon as they brought him around to me, all those fears and everything were taken away,\" she said. With the help of non-profit organization, Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep, the Walker family had a photographer capture the hours they had with baby Grayson. By treating his birth like any other special delivery, the Walkers hope to keep Grayson's memory alive forever. \"Yes, I'm going to cry and I'm probably going to lay in my bed some days, but I have that hope that God has got him in his hands and we're going to get to meet him again someday,\" said Heather Walker. \"You know, my son lived almost eight hours, and he's already done in eight hours what I could never do in a hundred lifetimes, and that's awesome,\" said Patrick Walker.\n The bottom line is that there's no injured little boy in need of good-hearted souls willing to use Facebook's \"share\" feature to pass along the photo and attached information to their social network friends.

It doesn't appear so. The 1891 edition of Chicago hardware dealer Hibbard, Spencer, Bartlett & Co.'s General Catalog lists Smith & Wesson .45 cartridges at a price of $25 per thousand, or 2-1/2 cents per cartridge. For the price of a shot of whiskey, we consulted Kelly J. Dixon's 2005 book Boomtown Saloons: Archaeology and History in Virginia City, which notes that the average cost of a measure of any drink was around two bits, or 25 cents (although the cost later dropped as competition increased when more Americans moved west). Using those figures as our base prices, one shot of whiskey would have cost the equivalent of 10 cartridges. Even allowing for price variations according to time and place, it appears highly doubtful a one-to-one correspondence between the price of a cartridge and the cost of a drink ever existed in the Old West. lists We also looked into the etymology of the noun shot, which has a long and interesting history as well as many shades of meaning. It derives from the Old English verb scotan (later scot), meaning \"to shoot,\" or \"let loose a projectile.\" etymology shot The earliest known usage of \"shot\" in the sense of \"a measure of liquor\" appeared in the autobiography of the Rev. Oliver Heywood (1630-1702), in which we find the phrase \"their vain way of drinking shots.\" Unfortunately for the trading-cartridges-for-shots theory, the usage predates the time period of the Old West (which, by convention, was roughly 1850 to 1900) by some 150 years.  autobiography Interestingly enough, the term \"shot\" was also at one time synonymous with \"a charge to be paid\" (and, in a more specific usage, \"a bill or one's share of it, especially in a pub or bar\"), according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Again, however, those meanings predate the Old West era, in this case going all the way back to 15th-century England, hundreds of years before saloons and cowpokes dotted the western frontier of the United States. according Despite their sharing the same derivation, it's unclear precisely how these three disparate senses of the word came to be associated with one another. A theory advanced on the Etymology Online web site suggests that the expression \"throw down\" (as in \"throw down one's money\") may link them: Meaning \"discharge of a bow, missile,\" also is from related Old English gesceot. Extended to other projectiles in Middle English, and to sports (hockey, basketball, etc.) 1868. Another original meaning, \"payment\" (perhaps literally \"money thrown down\") is preserved in scot-free. \"Throwing down\" might also have led to the meaning \"a drink,\" first attested 1670s, the more precise meaning \"small drink of straight liquor\" by 1928 (shot glass by 1955). scot-free Finally, when we used Google's Ngram Viewer to chart how frequently the exact phrase \"shot of whiskey\" appeared in published sources from the year 1800 on, we found that it didn't actually become common until the mid-20th century, by which time all that was left of the Old West were fading memories, rusting artifacts, and folklore. chart Martin, Katherine Connor.  \"What Is the Origin of the Term 'Scot-Free.'\"\r\n  Oxford Dictionaries.  15 April 2015.

The girl had had gone missing from in front of her house on Wednesday morning, and was later abandoned back there in a nearly unconscious state. According to the police the girl, a student of class two, daughter of a suffering single mom, was abducted from in front of her house by three unknown men. She was taken to a nearby, where she was raped by the three men, one of them identified by the police. She was also beaten up before she was abandoned in front of her home.

Norbert Kthler, the Managing Director of Trier Tourism and Marketing, acknowledged the humor in putting Marx on a worthless piece of currency: acknowledged Norbert Kthler, Geschftsfhrer der ttm, sagt zu dem Null-Euro-Schein: Das Souvenir setzt sich spielerisch mit der Marxschen Kapitalismuskritik auseinander. Und natrlich passen die Null-Euro-Scheine auch hervorragend zu Marx als Geldscheinmotiv. Norbert Kthler, Managing Director of TTM, says about the Zero Euro note: \"The souvenir playfully deals with Marx's critique of capitalism. And of course, zero-euro bills also fit perfectly with the Marx motif.\" Satirical web site the Sacramento Brie also used an altered version of this image in an article that facetiously claimed that the zero value Marx bill was being used in Venezuela to boost the country's economy.

From all around the world. If you can please share this maybe it will reach someone who finds them on the side of the highway. I will pay a reward if needed. They aren't worth anything to anyone but me. If found please contact Shawn email me at sv136913@yahoo.com or message me on Facebook\n Origins:  This appeal from a U.S. Marine named Shawn Vernon for help in locating a collection of shirts he lost when a box fell off his truck somewhere between Missouri and Oklahoma hit social media in July 2014.  According to Missouri television station KOMU, the message is a genuine one, although the shirts were lost a few months before the appeal for help in finding them went viral: \n\nA U.S. Marine based at Fort Leonard Wood has lost shirts he collected while serving around the globe. Staff Sergeant Shawn Vernon collected shirts from 24 countries over 17 years of service in the Marines. \"I collected them all, and I'm getting ready to retire this year,\" Vernon said. \"I was starting to move stuff back to Texas, and in the course of that move, that's the one box that fell off the back of the truck.\" The Purple Heart recipient said he realized the shirts were missing in Oklahoma, so they could have fallen off anywhere between Fort Leonard Wood  and Durant, Oklahoma. He posted about the missing shirts on Facebook, and says the post has gone viral. He also contacted Oklahoma Department of Public Safety asking for help. He says he has no viable leads so far. \"I've had a few that are more or less just fishing attempts of people trying to get me to send them money,\" Vernon said. \"I offered a reward because they're really irreplaceable.\" Vernon has been searching for almost two months and still hopes to find the shirts. \"It would mean a lot to me because then whenever I'm retired, I can wear those and kind of sow where I've been and the tings that I've done throughout my career in the Marine Corps,\" Vernon said.\n Additional information:  \n\n    Interview with Shawn Vernon  (KOMU-TV)\n\n\n  Interview with Shawn Vernon  (KOMU-TV) Last updated:  7 July 2014\n",

First, while this message purportedly comes from a business that has been operating for 50 years, their Facebook page was only established on 21 July 2016. Second, the Facebook page claims that it represents Major RV, a company based out of California, but lists its location as Eving, Germany. The lack of contact information on the Facebook page is also suspect:   Major RV caught wind of the scam and posted on their Facebook page to warn consumers the offer was fake: Facebook So [we] were hacked by Luxury RV. There is no giveaway at Major RV in Hesperia, Ca sorry for the inconvenience.",

        "justification": " Claim:  Comedian Gabriel Iglesias is dead.  FALSE Examples:  [Collected via email, October 2014]  This is just one claim of many on Facebook that Gabriel Iglesias has passed away. Please put the truth on Snopes and set the record straight. Thank you.\n \n There is a rumor about Gabriel Iglesias dying from diabetes. Is it true?\n Origins:  On 1 November 2014, a fake news story claiming comedian Gabriel Iglesias had passed away started circulating on Facebook: \n\nGabriel Iglesias, (born July 15, 1976) known professionally  as Gabriel Iglesias and comically as Fluffy died this Friday for causes that are still not confirmed but it seems to be a health complication.\n\n The article originated on a hoax website designed to appear as if it were part of the NBC News network. However, that web site, Universalnoticias.org, is not affiliated with the National Broadcasting Company.  Universalnoticias.org Oddly enough, the hoaxsters decided to use a fraudulent image from CBS, not NBC, to sell the lie about Gabriel Iglesias' alleged death:   The photo was shared by thousands of worried Fluffy fans and eventually landed in front of the eyes of the comedian. On 2 November 2014, Gabriel Iglesias posted a message on Facebook to assure his fans he was still alive: Facebook \n\nAccording to this article below I guess I died Friday and no one decided to tell me. Well, since I'm dead now I guess I can start eating carbs again. It was a good life. Had a great childhood and an amazing career. I traveled the world and got drunk in all 50 states, woooooo! I made a lot of people happy over the years and pissed off most my ex girlfriends in the process. Can't win them all, right? Soooo I guess I want to be buried somewhere people can visit my grave, put pretty flowers and pour diet cokes on my plot. I'm gonna want my estate to buy both plots next to me so that even in death I can stretch my legs. I would love it very much if people were to visit my grave and take selfies with it. Even in death I'm still a social media attention whore,#FarewellFluffy .  There should be no charge to visit my grave so don't pay any attention to the shady guy by the gate with the comedy club passes in the new Jaguar trying to raise money by selling tickets to get in the cemetery. U just tell him to go fund himself and he will leave u alone. To my family, the ones who still spoke to me til my last day I say thank u for being so understanding and loving me no matter how long I was on the road doing what I had to do to make everyone's lives better. To the family I no longer spoke to I say, I'm sorry for not being what u wanted me to be. To all my friends, thank u for not telling me I died. U guys always keep news that bums me out away from me and I love u for it. To my fans I say thank u so much for letting me make u laugh all these years. It's the most amazing feeling in the world. Please pirate, bootleg, share copy and distribute all my comedy videos. I made a lot of money over the years. Don't worry, I'm leaving my family well off so enjoy. When someone finds out what I died from please let me know. If it's not health related I'm gonna be pissed. It's gonna suck to know I gave up a lot of snacks this year just to die from a stupid accident. Well, since I'm gone I might actually take a long deserved break. Who am I kidding? My agent is probably already booking me for The \"Back from the dead Fluffy tour\".  If this death hoax someone did about my ass has taught me anything it's that I need to enjoy more moments in life and not get so stressed out about things I can't change, especially with my self. I have people who care about me that I made happy in my life and in \"the end\" that's all that's really gonna matter. Thank u to everyone who texted, called and e-mailed asking if I died. I love u all!!!!\n Gabriel Iglesias is not the first celebrity to be \"killed\" by an internet rumor. In fact, it has become a bit of an honor. Fluffy, who also debunked the rumor on Twitter, said the death hoax was proof his career is going great:  Twitter  \n\n\n\n  Last updated:  3 November 2014\n ",

        "justification": "Claim:  Eyebrow waxers are at risk of contracting herpes from unsanitary equipment. \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2005] \n\n\nHello All, I had to take it upon myself to inform all of my girlfriends about Jonsey and today's Funk. Well for my south and central jersey folks who can't get hot 97 I will share today's funk with you. Please pay close attention this can really affect all of us. This woman called in and said that one day her co worker came in and her eyebrows were looking sharp and asked her where did she go to get them done. The girl told her King Nails in Harlem and that she should go because they are really good. The woman went and proceeded to have her eyebrows and lip waxed. Two weeks later she realized that her lip and eye brows were breaking out in puss filled bumps all over. She went to the doctor's office and they sadly informed her that she had Herpes. The married woman who stated that she never cheated was wondering how she possibly got herpes not only on her lip but on her eyebrows. Well Ladies if you ever take the time to notice these people never use a new stick. The same stick stays in that wax and if someone has herpes those bacteria is now on the stick and now the bacteria festers and grows in the hot wax. So Ladies, this would be a great time to invest in your own tweezers and sharpen your skills. Or find a place that provides threading technique.\n Origins:  This breathless warning about danger inherent to eyebrow waxing began showing up in our inbox in the early part of November 2005. According to the text, a caller to the \"Miss Jones in the Morning\"   show on New York radio station Hot 97 described having acquired herpes through virus-contaminated eyebrow waxing implements. (We have yet to confirm this detail; our e-mail to the station asking if there had been such a caller has so far gone unanswered.) The \"Jonesy\" of the e-mail is Miss Jones; the \"today's Funk\" we would presume is a standard segment of her show. Hot 97 As to whether it is possible to pick up the virus in the described fashion, we called the National Herpes Hotline (919-361-8488) to ask just that. No, we were told, it's not. Herpes is a \"very fragile virus\" and so could not survive on the implement used to apply the wax, nor in the warm wax itself. The counselor we spoke to added there have been \"no documented cases of it being passed like  that.\" Herpes is unfortunately ubiquitous. An estimated 50 to 80 percent of American adults have oral herpes (commonly known as cold sores or fever blisters), and about one in four adults in the United States has genital herpes. However, most people who have contracted the genital variety of herpes don't know they are infected because their symptoms are too mild to notice or are mistaken for other conditions. The rumor about herpes being spread at waxing salons that take a cavalier attitude towards hygiene echoes a theme found in other urban legends, that of dread disease contracted by random innocent parties engaging in what should be safe activities  for example, AIDS acquired via a prick from a needle affixed to the handle of a gas pump, by ingesting HIV-laden blood added to restaurant ketchup dispensers, through eating pizza to which HIV-laden semen had been added; flesh-eating contagion passed on the skins of bananas imported from Costa Rica; and Weil's Disease contracted via soda cans encrusted with rat urine. gas pump ketchup pizza bananas rat urine Such rumors are society's way of expressing our disquiet about having to co-exist with dread contagion even in medically advanced times. Where the malady is passed in a non-malicious manner, an additional type of unease is expressed, that of having to rely so much on the diligence of others for our own safety. (After all, every time we eat in a restaurant we are placing our trust in that establishment's employees to have properly prepared what we're about to ingest and to have observed good hygiene practices  it's as if we see what goes on in the kitchen or how clean the cook's fingernails are.) This latest rumor about herpes and eyebrow waxing is but an updated form of the \"we're placing our wellbeing in the hands of strangers, and maybe they're not really watching out for us\" anxiety.

The representative said 2017 was the first year in which the letter was not physically mailed to participating schools, but made available for download on the PEAP web site. The official version of this year's letter [PDF], does not contain the purported typographical error spelling \"success\" as \"succuess\": letter PDF       Although a separate person claims that a friend received the version with an error on the same date Frautnick shared the photograph, that account was secondhand and might have referenced Frautnick's Facebook post. Aside from that copy, we were unable to find any versions containing the spelling error. claims Frautnick sent us additional photographs to show that she had not doctored the image of the letter that she posted to Facebook. She told us: Its the actual letter my daughter received with the presidential award. I took a picture of it when she pointed out the typo. I posted it and it went viral. She received it from the white house through her school. The official published President's Education Award letter for 2017 lacked the \"succuess\" error present in Facebook shares of the document. We rate this \"mostly false\" because a copy of the letter with the spelling error exists but was not reproduced across the country. We have so far unable to determine whether the typographical error was only regionally distributed or simply fabricated.

        "justification": "For years, comedian Adam Sandler has been the target of fictional online reports supposedly informing the world of his death. For example, on January 13, 2017, LinkBeef published an item asserting that Sandler had been found dead of an apparent suicide: LinkBeef dead US actor and comedian Adam Sandler has been found dead, aged 49, in an apparent suicide. Marin County Police in California said he was pronounced dead at his home shortly after officials responded to an emergency call around noon local time ... His publicist said he had been battling severe depression. The local Sheriffs office said Sandler was found unconscious and not breathing at his home near Tiburon, north of San Francisco. At this time, the Sheriffs Office Coroner Division suspects the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia, but a comprehensive investigation must be completed before a final determination is made, police said in a statement. In a statement, Adams wife, Jackie Sandler, said she was utterly heartbroken and asked that he be remembered for the joy he brought to the world. That report was nothing more than another celebrity death hoax from fake news purveyor LinkBeef, whose previously published falsehoods include claims that a gang member died after gold plating his genitals, that a \"lab-grown\" baby had been born, that the pilot of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was found alive in Taiwan, and that a wealthy man attempted to recruit many women to be the prospective mothers of his children. genitals baby Malaysia Airlines prospective mothers Like many long-running fake news outfits, the page renders first as \"LinkBeef\" before reloading to display \"Interesting Things Daily.\" Then, in late 2020, a TikTok user revived the false rumor by posting a video with the text, \"Adam Sandler has now been pronounced dead after drowning.\" video   Again, this was not a factual retelling of events. Sandler was alive and in the public's eye at the time, promoting recent projects, such as \"Hubie Halloween.\" Hubie Halloween The rumor surfaced again in January 2022, and tabloids such as The Sun featured the above-mentioned TikTok in articles compiling social media users' reaction to the false rumor.

        "justification": "On Feb. 10, 2021, an online advertisement appeared to announce big news about Costco Wholesale. The ad was displayed on various websites via the Outbrain advertising network. It featured a picture of a Costco store and read: \"[Pics] Say Goodbye: Stores Closing In 2020 Across The Nation.\" Costco Wholesale   The outdated ad mentioned the year 2020. This likely meant that it had been displayed prior to the new year and had not yet been disabled. Readers who clicked the ad were led to a lengthy slideshow article on the Housecoast website. It spanned more than 50 pages and appeared to have been originally published on Feb. 10, 2020. article Companies such as Lowe's, Kohl's, JCPenney, and Macy's made the list. While several of the stores in the article had experienced financial troubles, many of them had not yet closed. Costco never appeared in the story. The clickbait ad led readers to believe that Costco would be closing its stores. This was false. The story itself was poorly written and contained a number of grammatical errors. These Power Stores Will Be Closing In 2020 When e-commerce started expanding in the last few years, \"brick and mortar\" stores started to face the brunt of the economic crisis. In the last couple of years leading up to 2020, a lot of major stores have been closing their physical doors to businesses to include international outlets. It is a real blow to the business of commerce as the closing rate has been growing rapidly and projected for 2020; it may get worst. We have compiled a few stores who have noted they will be closing their doors in 2020  for some stores, they will be closing all their outlets. On Dec. 10, 2020, Costco Wholesale released its fiscal year 2020 financial results. The numbers were strong. There was no indication that Costco would be closing stores: released Net sales for fiscal 2020 totaled $163 billion, an increase of 9%, with a comparable sales increase of 8%. Net income was $4 billion, or $9.02 per diluted share, an increase of 9%. In addition, the Company surpassed 100 million members worldwide, contributing to membership revenue of $3.54 billion. Costco.com played a vital role in meeting members' needs, especially those choosing or required to stay at home. Our ecommerce business saw a 50% increase in sales. Increases were particularly evident in same day and 2-day grocery deliveries, prescription medications, electronics, and office supplies. Additional strong sales were seen in apparel, appliances, health and beauty products, and home furnishings. Our depots responded to unprecedented volume by shifting certain operations to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. As circumstances allowed, expansion in fiscal 2020 continued, with the opening of 13 new warehouses. In fiscal 2021, we expect to open 20 new buildings. In sum, a misleading ad appeared to claim that Costco was closing its stores. The resulting story never mentioned Costco even once. In the past, the Housecoast website published a similar misleading ad about CNN Chief White House Correspondent Kaitlan Collins. a similar misleading ad Snopes debunks a wide range of content, and online advertisements are no exception. Misleading ads often lead to obscure websites that host lengthy slideshow articles with lots of pages.

In an interview with The Associated Press, the lawyer representing the man  Jacob Chansley or \"Jake Angeli\" of Arizona  said his client's attitude toward the president had changed since the deadly siege, and he was willing to testify in Trump's historic second impeachment. That trial by the U.S. Senate was set to begin the week of Feb. 8 and would either convict or acquit the former president of inciting his supporters to break into the Capitol on Jan. 6 to try to halt a ceremonial vote to affirm the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. halt a ceremonial vote The attorney, Albert Watkins, said he wants senators to hear the perspective of someone who was incited by Trump, according to the Jan. 30 story. The Associated Press continued: Jan. 30 story Watkins said his client was previously 'horrendously smitten' by Mr. Trump but now feels let down after Mr. Trump's refusal to grant Chansley and others who participated in the insurrection a pardon. 'He felt like he was betrayed by the president,' Watkins said. Here is a full list of the people Trump pardoned or commuted during his final hours in office. full list We reached out to Watkins to determine the legitimacy of the news story. In an email, we sent him a link to The Associated Press reporting, asked him if it was indeed accurate, and, if so, inquired why or under what circumstances his party decided to offer Angeli's testimony. He responded in an email message to Snopes: \"My client is available if called upon to testify. No statement to the contrary has been made.\" In other words, it was true to claim that Angeli  who was arrested and charged on Jan. 9 for insurrection-related crimes including civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, and disorderly conduct  was willing to testify in Trump's Senate impeachment trial, which may determine whether Trump can run for political office in the future. Jan. 9 whether However, the nature of Angeli's testimony, should he be asked to speak during the trial, remained unknown as of this writing. \"The words of Trump supporters who are accused of participating in the riot may end up being used against him in his impeachment trial,\" The Associated Press reported, though no evidence existed to determine whether Angeli would indeed share his experience to help senators convict the former president. In sum, while it was true that Angeli was willing to testify at Trump's second impeachment trial, it was not known whether he was preparing to make a statement that would help or hurt the efforts of senators who believe the former president is guilty of inciting the insurrection. For those reasons, we rate this claim a \"mixture\" of truthful, false, and undetermined information.",

        "justification": "In December 2020, some social media users encountered a message claiming that Cadbury was giving away hampers (or baskets) filled with chocolate to celebrate its 70th anniversary. This was not a genuine message from the famous confectionary company, however. It was just another social media scam.  Here's an example of one such message that circulated on WhatsApp:   A similar scam circulated on Facebook. That message claimed that everyone who shared and commented on the post would get a \"Cadbury Hamper delivered to their door\" in celebration of the company's 126th anniversary. message   This type of scam is common on social media. Users are asked to share and comment on the content in order to ensure that it gets spread to as many people as possible, and then users are asked to provide personal information, such as email addresses or even credit card numbers, under the guise of completing a \"survey\" or some other questionnaire.  We've had many occasions to alert readers to this kind of fraud: These types of viral coupon scams often involve websites and social media pages set up to mimic those of legitimate companies. Users who respond to those fake offers are required to share a website link or social media post in order to spread the scam more widely and lure in additional victims. Then those users are presented with a survey that extracts personal information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and even sometimes credit card numbers. Finally, those who want to claim their free gift cards or coupons eventually learn they must first sign up to purchase a number of costly goods, services, or subscriptions. This Cadbury scam has been circulating in various forms on social media since at least 2018. The company addressed these fraudulent posts in a November 2020 message on Facebook: message   Weve been made aware of a circulating post on social media, claiming to offer consumers a hamper of free Cadbury products. We can confirm that this has not been generated by us & would urge you to not interact or share personal information through the post. Your security is our priority & were working with the relevant organisations to ensure this is resolved.

It's easy to steal the colors, logos and header of an established organization. Scammers can also make links look like they lead to legitimate websites and emails appear to come from a different sender. Legitimate businesses do not ask for credit card numbers or banking information on customer surveys. If they do ask for personal information, like an address or email, be sure there's a link to their privacy policy. Watch out for a reward that's too good to be true. If the survey is real, you may be entered in a drawing to win a gift card or receive a small discount off your next purchase. Few businesses can afford to give away $50 gift cards for completing a few questions. Several state lotteries have warned their players against Facebook scams:    If you want to win the Mega Millions or Powerball lottery games, your best method for achieving that goal is to actually go out and buy a ticket. Of course, some might consider that approach scarcely better than doing nothing, since the odds of winning $1 million in Powerball are less than1 in 11 million. odds  [article-meta] [green-label]Last updated:[/green-label]15 October 2015 [green-label]Originally published:[/green-label] 15 October 2015",

I go to Harker Heights High School, have friends, study hard, and I'm involved in after school activities. Well my thoughts about how I was going to spend my first year of high school changed drastically on Monday, September 14th, 2015. I was standing out front of the school and a boy decided to put a handful of super glue into my hair and on my scalp. He had previously told another boy that he was going to put it in a girls hair while he poured it into his hand. The super glue BURNED and I couldn't help but cry. My dad had to pick me up from school and at the time that he picked me up the school wasn't doing ANYTHING about this boy, until my dad told them to or he would call 911. I had to be taken to Urgent Care so they could remove the glue from my scalp, which gave me a chemical burn (this took a 1/2 hour!). I kept thinking the whole time \"What did I do to deserve this?\". Later in the evening my mother and I were attempting to remove the glue from the rest of my hair, which hurt horribly. We ended up having to shave 1/2 of my head because the glue was so bad. The boy had ISS for a couple of days and today I had to call my dad because he was there and I have a class with him. I was in tears! My dad came to pick me up and he was upset of course. He got his sticker when you sign in at the office, he signed me out and the officer wouldn't let him take me home. My dad told me to come on and the officer told me to stay right there. The officer gave my dad a criminal trespass warning and told him that if he came back on campus that he would be arrested. I was finally able to go with my dad after he was in the parking lot and asking over and over \"Where is my daughter?\". The criminal trespass warning was told to happen by the principal. How come I have to be treated like the criminal and the person who caused me harm get's to walk around like nothing happened? THIS IS HOW KISD TREATS CHILDREN AND FAMILIES! PLEASE SHARE SO THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE!!!!! Origins: On 18 September 2015, Facebook user Jessica Grimmer published the text and photographs excerpted above, pertaining to an alleged assault involving a female student named Hannah and an unnammed male student at Harker Heights High School in Harker Heights, Texas. In an earlier (and far less popular) Facebook post, Grimmer identified herself as Hannah's mother and reported that Hannah (a freshman) was standing outside of the school building on 14 September 2015 when an unnamed male student forcibly applied superglue to her hair and scalp. published identified Grimmer indicated that Hannah's father arrived and demanded action, but whether any action was taken on the part of the school at that time was not stated. Hannah's mother shared additional photographs of the girl at an urgent care clinic and afterwards, with half of her head shaved. On a separate day, Grimmer said that the boy was reinstated to his classes with Hannah following a brief period of in-school suspension (commonly abbreviated to \"ISS\") even though the forced contact was described as so upsetting to Hannah that she called her father to pick her up. girl After that, Grimmer said, adults involved on the school's end became adversarial. At some point after Hannah's father arrived, an officer initially refused to release the child and allegedly issued a warning barring the father from campus. In her follow-up post with the urgent care photographs, Grimmer addressed doubts about the tale and urged social media users to contact Killeen Independent School District (KISD) regarding the incident: It has been brought to our attention that the validity of Hannah's story is in question by some. Rest assured that there wouldn't be a post like this if it weren't accurate because I am a private person. So to make a public post that opens my family up to the world was a big choice on our part. If there are any parents who's child attends Harker Heights High and would like to voice their concerns, or check the validity you can reach the Principal, Larry Brazzil at: [redacted]. Parents, just be aware that there is an assailant walking the halls freely. Also the superintendent is, John Craft and can be reached at: [redacted]. His email is: [redacted]. Attached are the pictures of Hannah's hair when she was in Urgent Care, after Urgent Care (where they removed the glue from her scalp), and when she was having her head shaved. Grimmer also encouraged social media users following the story to follow the page Justice for Hannah, which published an update that read: update We received a phone call stating that this matter has been addressed and Hannah will be safe at school. We can't say specifics due to them being minors, but this is a step in the right direction. We will see how tomorrow goes. Keep up the fight against bullying!! Thanks for all of the support. Among comments on Grimmer's post were ones added by an individual identified by others as the boy's aunt. Although those posts were deleted, commenters shared screenshots of what they said were counterarguments levied by the boy's relatives, who maintained that the incident was an accident with no malicious intent: Grimmer's account made no mention of the purported altercation referenced by the boy's relatives, it did not describe the degree of injury Hannah suffered beyond \"burns\" (which weren't visible in the photographs), and it did not relate the events leading up to Hannah's father being banned from campus. The Killeen Independent School District (KISD) had not publicly addressed the claims as of 21 September 2015.  We have contacted the district to determine which (if any) details of the incident they can confirm or deny. KISD  Last updated: 22 September 2015 Originally published: 21 September 2015",

        "justification": "Claim:  Photograph taken during fatal Columbia mission reveals large cracks in the shuttle's wing. \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, 2003] \n\n\nJerusalem  The Israeli newspaper Maariv on Monday published a picture of the American space shuttle Columbia apparently showing two cracks on its left wing. The   picture was taken 11 days before the shuttle broke up on its way back to Earth on Saturday, killing all seven crew members. The photograph was extracted from footage taken by a camera onboard the shuttle during a live satellite video conference between Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Colonel Ilan Ramon, the first Israeli to travel to space. During the 15-minute conversation with Sharon and other Israeli officials, Ramon offered to share his view of Earth from the shuttle. 'It would not have been able to do anything to save the crew'\nThe video caught part of the shuttle's left wing, showing two \"long\" cracks, according to the newspaper. The fissures could have been the cause of the technical problems experienced by the shuttle which led to its breakup over Texas, 16 minutes before it was due to land, the newspaper stated.\n Origins:  As noted above, a few days after the U.S. space shuttle Columbia broke up upon re-entry to Earth, killing all seven astronauts aboard, the Israeli news service Maariv published a news story  Maariv news story accompanied by a photograph taken from a live video interview conducted with Israeli shuttle astronaut Ilan Ramon 11 days before Columbia's disastrous end.  The photograph purportedly shows two large, plainly visible cracks in one of Columbia's wings, supposedly demonstrating that not only had Columbia suffered significant damage (presumably from debris which struck its left wing 80 seconds after takeoff), but that the damage was obvious and should have been noticed and acted upon well before Columbia's fatal plunge through the atmosphere. The picture wasn't a photo of Columbia's wing, however: it was a photo of the front inside edge of the cargo bay, and the \"cracks\" were simply ordinary seams.  The black protrusion (resembling a stovepipe hat of the sort favored by Abraham Lincoln) visible in the right-center portion of the image is one of many lugs that the cargo bay doors clamp onto when closed to ensure a tight seal.  A similar lug can be seen in this panoramic photo of the shuttle's cargo bay:  This video pan of the cargo bay provides a better view showing the location of the lug and the structure to which it is attached relative to the rest of the shuttle. Still frames from the video have been misinterpreted as showing a large dent in the shuttle's wing, but the structure is the cargo bay (with the seams mistaken for \"cracks\" in the original photograph shown clearly), and the \"dent\" is actually a ripple in the bay's fabric covering: video  Last updated:  20 September 2006 \n\n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   Independent Online.  \"'Photograph Shows Cracks on Shuttle's Wing.\"\n   3 February 2003.\n\n",

Many women journalists were in hiding after being told to return home as Kabul was taken by the armed group. Against this backdrop, a set of \"before and after\" images started circulating that supposedly showed CNN's Clarissa Ward in her regular clothing before the Taliban takeover, and with much of her face, body, and hair covered afterward: These images are real. However, they deserve a little additional context.   Ward explained on Twitter that the \"before\" image shown here was taken in a private compound. The reporter also said that she always wore a head scarf while on the streets of Kabul. However, Ward stated that she began wearing an abaya (a full-length outer garment for women) and fully covered her hair after the Taliban took over the area: explained on Twitter This meme is inaccurate. The top photo is inside a private compound. The bottom is on the streets of Taliban held Kabul. I always wore a head scarf on the street in Kabul previously, though not w/ hair fully covered and abbaya. So there is a difference but not quite this stark. It should also be noted that Ward was not the only woman who was reporting from the ground following the Taliban's take over of Afghanistan, and that her clothing decisions were not replicated by every other journalist. Two Afghan reporters from the local news outlet TOLO News, for example, wore head scarves without the abaya (similar to what Ward would often wear prior to the Taliban take over). The founder of Tolo News' parent company tweeted a photograph of some women reporters in Kabul:    While Ward noted on Twitter that the changes weren't as stark as presented in this meme, female journalists are truly worried for their lives in the area. The Guardian reported: reported Female Afghan journalists tell of a once free and bustling Kabul now filled with silence and fear as they destroy traces of their identity and work to avoid Taliban militants. Aaisha is one of dozens of female Afghan journalists who have communicated with the Guardian over the past weeks, documenting the fall of their nation to share the devastation with the world. Now they fear that reporting without fear or favour will be the very thing that costs them their future. They constantly receive death threats from the Taliban, and from others who agree that women should not be treated as equal. You can see a video report filed by Ward from Afghanistan here.  here ",

        "justification": "In December 2014, a number of Facebook pages using car brand names such as Audi, Range Rover, Mercedes, and Camaro (among others) posted directives similar to the messages quoted above. The pages claimed that Facebook was giving away cars. Among the cars offered in the giveaways were Audi R8s, Range Rovers, Mercedes-Benz E63 AMGs, and Chevrolet Camaro SS models. Almost all the scams followed the same format: they instructed users to like a separate page, like the original post, and share the post on their own Timeline (thereby validating its legitimacy and enticing others to do the same).users were eligible to win one of two available vehicles in the winner's choice of color simply by liking a separate Facebook page, liking and sharing a post, and waiting for an inbox message confirming the winners. In April 2016, the scam reappeared, this time with a Range Rover as the car offered in the giveaway:    The first clue the giveaways following this format were not on the up-and-up was the pages to which Facebook users were directed, pages that had been created just days before the giveaway posts begin to appear. Not only were the secondary Facebook pages involved always new, they were also not linked with car companies or other interests one might imagine could reasonably be expected to offer up a car in exchange for social media advertising (such as automobile dealerships, insurance companies, or large retailers). Were a legitimate company to engage in such a high-ticket contest giveaway, the incentive would be exposure; however, no corresponding promotional return on advertising investment was discernable in these Facebook giveaway claims. The tactics were similar to recent scams involving Costco, Kroger and Amazon gift cards, but the six-figure price tag attached to some of the vehicles involved in the Facebook car giveaway posts proved a far more difficult-to-resist enticement for some users, not all of whom questioned whether sharing a page presented any negative consequence should it later turn out to be a prank, hoax, or other false promise. Costco Kroger Amazon The pages to which users were directed carried all the hallmarks of \"like farming\" operations intended to quickly build and sell popular Facebook pages. Even if the page creators' intent were only to build an audience, users' participating in the scam created a larger incentive for employing future fakery of the same description to crowd Facebook feeds. Scammers could also exploit a large audience by mining varying levels of personal data from those who have liked a page of dubious origin. So Facebook users who participate in such fake giveaways not only unwittingly help spammers pollute the social network with scams, they may also risk being exposed to malware, clickjacking, or other unpleasantries (such as finding their names and identities endorsing a scam, hate page, or other undesirable activity). Giveaways, particularly of high-value merchandise, are generally rare and almost always conducted through brands' official channels or the social media accounts of related large companies. ",

        "justification": "After the U.S. Capitol insurrection in January 2021, Snopes readers asked about the legitimacy of a viral document that left-leaning websites framed as an attempt by a member of former President Donald Trump's cabinet to suppress the ability of National Guard forces to provide law enforcement during the gathering of Trump supporters rallying to try to overturn the 2020 election. left-leaning websites 2020 election For example, the Daily Kos, a self-described online hub of progressive media and activism, reported on Jan. 29: online hub [On. Jan. 4], former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller issued a memo to the secretary of the Army placing some extremely unusual limits on National Guard forces for that event. Its not a to-do list. Its a list of thou shalt nots. A long list. A list that says guard forces cant arrest any of the pro-Trump protesters, or search them, or even touch them. And thats just for starters. [...] Its clear that these restrictions would have absolutely prevented any guard forces from trying to protect any location. A website called \"The National Memo\" republished the body of the Daily Kos' story verbatim, under a new headline: \"Trump Defense Secretary Disarmed D.C. National Guard Before Capitol Riot.\" The National Memo Before we directly address the claim, let us unpack the basis of the above-mentioned articles. The Daily Kos' original story included a hyperlink to an authentic tweet by New York Times congressional reporter Luke Broadwater on Jan. 28. tweet   The reporter's tweet included a digital image of what appeared to be a Jan. 4 memo to former Army secretary Ryan McCarthy and signed by Miller  whom Trump appointed as acting Pentagon chief in November 2020, just days after President Joe Biden was announced the winner of the election. Ryan McCarthy November 2020 was announced In early February, we reached out to Broadwater to learn where, how, or under what circumstances he obtained the document. He told us \"it was a leak,\" or that an anonymous person or group within government or law-enforcement released the document to The New York Times. While no evidence exists to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the document displayed in the tweet, we sought to independently verify its authenticity. Citing the Freedom of Information Act, Snopes submitted multiple requests for a copy of the Jan. 4 record from various record-keeping centers within federal government. Freedom of Information Act On March 3, the U.S. Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee fulfilled our request after its chair, Sen. Gary Peters, entered Miller's memo into the committee's public database of records. Committee spokespeople emailed us copies the document that indeed imposed restrictions on the D.C. National Guard (DCNG) during planned demonstrations by Trump supporters in the coming days. It read, in part: planned demonstrations Without my subsequent, personal authorization, the DCNG is not authorized the following: You may employ the DCNG Quick Reaction Force (QRF) only as a last resort and in response to a request from an appropriate civil authority. If the QRF is so employed, DCNG personnel will be clearly marked and/or distinguished from civilian law enforcement personnel, and you will notify me immediately upon your authorization. The document written by the Trump appointee did not order any person or entity to take away weapons from Guard members. Rather, it required McCarthy, who oversees the DCNG, to request approval from the defense secretary in order for Guard members to use weapons, helmets, body armor or riot control agents  as well as to share equipment with other law-enforcement agencies  during the preplanned gatherings of Trump supporters on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6. Rewind a few days, and, according to the Department of Defense, D.C. officials requested that the district's Metropolitan Police department  not a federal agency  lead security efforts during the pro-Trump events, which were widely marketed as gatherings of Trump supporters to try to send a message to Congress to halt a ceremonial vote affirming Biden's win. Department of Defense A Jan. 5 document signed by McCarthy and obtained by Snopes (displayed below) showed the Pentagon ultimately fulfilled that request, saying that its troops would provide support for the district police department or Capitol Hill Police, should they need it. Some 340 Guard members were planning to control crowds at metro stations and enforce street closures during the events, and a \"Quick Reaction Force\" comprised of 40 Guard officers was standing by, no matter what. \"DCNG Soldiers will store their helmets and body armor within vehicles or buildings in close proximity to their positions,\" McCarthy's memo read. \"In the event of an elevation of the threat requiring immediate donning of this equipment for self-defense, DCNG leadership will immediately notify the Secretary of Army.\" https://www.scribd.com/document/497258792/Secretary-of-the-Army-Memorandum#fullscreen=1 That decision by the Department of Defense, as well as the request for autonomy from D.C. officials, followed the Guard's controversial response to protests against police violence following George Floyd's death in summer 2020. Politico reported: George Floyd's death reported: While some of the early protests did include looting and damages to local businesses, [D.C. Mayor Muriel] Bowser never called in the National Guard. Against the mayor's wishes, Trump ordered Guard personnel to the city, where the military faced backlash for using overly aggressive crowd control tactics against peaceful protesters, including flying helicopters low over the city to create rotor wash, an action used in overseas conflicts. Any time we would employ troops and guardsmen in the city, you had to go through a rigorous process. As you recall, there were events in the summer that got a lot of attention, and that was part of this,\" William J. Walker, the DCNG's commanding general, said in an interview with The Washington Post. The Washington Post. Walker was referring to the guidelines (like those in the Jan. 4 and Jan. 5 memos) that required the highest-level approval for the Guard to fully launch into law-enforcement mode. As a result of such restrictions, Walker told The Washington Post that when he received a panicked phone call from Capitol Hill Police about the extremists preparing to break into the Capitol on Jan. 6 (which occurred around 1:50 p.m., per the defense department's timeline) he could not immediately deploy Guard members to help. He instead needed to wait for approval from McCarthy, who then waited for an answer from Miller. The Washington Post department's timeline At 3 p.m, Miller approved full activation of the DCNG (1,100 members) to help district and Capitol Hill police and directed those troops to secure the Capitol, the department's timeline showed. the department's timeline showed (See here for our fact check into a separate claim that the Department of Defense initially denied a request by D.C. officials to deploy the Guard.) here In sum, it was true that Miller issued a Jan. 4 memo requiring Guard leaders to seek prior approval before using weapons during the pro-Trump protests. However, it was an inaccurate portrayal of that order to claim that the Trump appointee \"disarmed\"  or took weapons away from  Guard members before the demonstrations, like The National Memo alleged. For those reasons, we rate this claim a \"mixture\" of false and true information. This report was updated after Snopes obtained a copy of Miller's Jan. 4 memo. The update corroborated the New York Times reporter's tweet and added context about McCarthy's response to D.C. officials' request to lead law-enforcement efforts during the upcoming protests.",

        "justification": "Denmark is a big shame The sea is stained in red and in the mean while it's not because of the climate effects of nature. It's because of the cruelty that the human beings (civilised human) kill hundreds of the famous and intelligent Calderon dolphins. This happens every year in Feroe iland in Denmark. In this slaughter the main participants are young teens. WHY? To show that they are adults and mature.... BULLLLsh In this big celebration, nothing is missing for the fun. Everyone is participating in one way or the other, killing or looking at the cruelty \"supporting like a spectator\" Is it necessary to mention that the dolphin calderon, like all the other species of dolphins, it's near instinction and they get near men to play and interact. In a way of PURE friendship They don't die instantly; they are cut 1, 2 or 3 times with thick hocks. And at that time the dolphins produce a grim extremely compatible with the cry of a new born child. But he suffers and there's no compassion till this sweet being slowly dies in its own blood Its enough! We will send this mail until this email arrives in any association defending the animals, we won't only read. That would make us accomplices, viewers. Take care of the world, it is your home! \n     The photographs displayed above were taken in 2005 and document a drive hunt (commonly known as a \"grind\") of long-finned pilot whales by residents of the Faroe Islands (which are an autonomous province of Denmark), an activity that has long been a subject of international controversy. document long-finned Faroe Islands The whale hunt has been a part of the Faroe Island culture for hundreds of years, but in recent decades the practice has increasingly become the subject of international protest and condemnation. Supporters of the hunt maintain that the killing of pilot whales is \"an age-old communal, noncommercial hunt aimed at meeting the community's need for whale meat and blubber,\" that the animals are dealt with so quickly that their pain is brief, and that whale meat accounts for a quarter of the Faroe islanders' annual meat consumption. Conservationists charge that the hunts, which may take hundreds of whales at a time, are barbaric and pointless, that \"the practice is outdated, cruel and unnecessary for a place with one of the highest standards of living in Europe,\" and that most of the whales go to waste (either being left on the beach to rot or thrown back to sea after they are killed. According to Russell Fielding, a geographer from the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee: The Faroese are opportunistic hunters who launch a grind only when specific conditions are met. The animals must be close to shore, near one of 23 beaches approved as a landing beach. The weather and currents have to be calm enough. And there have to be enough participants to crew the dozen or so powerboats required to drive the animals toward shore. In some years, such as in 2008, conditions weren't right and no whales were taken. But over the past three centuries, the Faroese have taken an average of 838 pilot whales and 75 dolphins each year, Fielding reported in a 2012 study. The Faroese usually target long-finned pilot whales, says Fielding, although they will also take bottlenose dolphins, white-sided dolphins, and Risso's dolphins. Risso's dolphins are sometimes landed even though they aren't on the Faroe government's list of species approved for hunting. None of the species are considered endangered, although the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists long-finned pilot whales as \"data deficient,\" meaning there isn't enough scientific evidence to judge the status of the North Atlantic population. A Faroe Islands whaling site page describes such hunts unfolding as follows: whaling site Whale drives only take place when a school of pilot whales is sighted close to land, which is most often from a local fishing boat or ferry, and when sea and weather conditions make it possible. This can take place at any time of the year, but catches are most common in July and August when the days are long and the weather is more stable. Notice of the school is sent to the elected whaling officials and to the district administrator (sslumaur) responsible for the whale drive, and is spread as widely and quickly as possible in the local community so that enough people and boats can join in the drive. Employers usually make allowances for members of their staff to take time off during whale drives. The boats gather in a wide semicircle behind the whales and slowly and quietly begin to drive them\ntowards the chosen authorised bay. On the whaling foremans signal, loose stones and stones attached to lines are thrown into the water behind the whales, helping to herd the whales towards the beach where they become stranded. According to the regulations, any group of whales which cannot be beached in this manner must be driven out to sea again. A crucial factor in ensuring an effective whale drive is the organisation of participants, both in boats and on shore, in addition to prevailing weather and tidal conditions during driving and beaching. The spontaneous nature of a whale drive requires swift mobilisation of manpower to drive and kill a group of large wild animals quickly. Whale drives are only initiated when whales are sighted by chance close to land. Faroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. Whales are killed on the shore and in the shallows of bays especially authorised for the purpose. A regulation spinal lance must be used to sever the spinal cord, which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. This, in addition to the supplementary use of the traditional whaling knife, if necessary, is the most efficient and humane means of killing beached pilot whales safely, with many participants involved at the same time. In recent years, two new items of equipment have been developed and formally approved and required as standard equipment. The blow-hole hook used to secure the whales causes no injury prior to slaughter and is now widely used. The spinal lance has now also been introduced as the preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales. It has been shown to reduce killing time to 1-2 seconds while also improving accuracy and safety (see also under Whaling and animal welfare). The Faroes participate actively in the work of the NAMMCO Committee on Hunting Methods, where veterinary experts and experienced hunters from different countries share information and work to develop best practices for the humane killing of marine mammals. In 1986 the International Whaling Commission (IWC) introduced \"zero catch limits for commercial whaling\"; however, the IWC's rules still allow for subsistence hunting in some parts of the world, and the application of their regulations to long-finned pilot whales is somewhat ambiguous since (despite their name) those animals are not whales proper; they are (like dolphins) small cetaceans, and they belong to the same biological family (Delphinidae) as dolphins. IWC small cetaceans In late 2008, chief medical officers of the Faroe Islands advised that they no longer considered pilot whales to be fit for human consumption because the animals' meat and blubber had been found to contain too much mercury, PCBs and DDT derivatives. advised As noted above, the Faroe Islands are an autonomous province of Denmark and not a part of Denmark itself; essentially a self-governing country within the Kingdom of Denmark, with their own prime minister and legislature.

        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  In 1854 Chief Seattle gave a stirring speech about the sanctity of the land and the need for careful stewardship of it. \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Perry, 1971] \n\n\nHow can you buy or sell the sky, the warmth of the land? The idea is strange to us. If we do not own the freshness of the air and the sparkle of the water, how can you buy them? Every part of the Earth is sacred to my people. Every shining pine needle, every sandy shore, every mist in the dark woods, every clear and humming insect is holy in the memory and experience of my people. The sap which courses through the trees carries the memory and experience of my people. The sap which courses through the trees carries the memories of the red man. The white man's dead forget the country of their birth when they go to walk among the stars. Our dead never forget this beautiful Earth, for it is the mother of the red man. We are part of the   Earth and it is part of us. The perfumed flowers are our sisters, the deer, the horse, the great eagle, these are our brothers. The rocky crests, the juices in the meadows, the body heat of the pony, and the man, all belong to the same family. So, when the Great Chief in Washington sends word that he wishes to buy our land, he asks much of us. The Great White Chief sends word he will reserve us a place so that we can live comfortably to ourselves. He will be our father and we will be his children. So we will consider your offer to buy land. But it will not be easy. For this land is sacred to us. This shining water that moves in streams and rivers is not just water but the blood of our ancestors. If we sell you land, you must remember that it is sacred blood of our ancestors. If we sell you land, you must remember that it is sacred, and you must teach your children that it is sacred and that each ghostly reflection in the clear water of the lakes tells of events in the life of my people. The waters murmur is the voice of my father's father. The rivers of our brothers they quench our thirst. The rivers carry our canoes and feed our children. If we sell you our land, you must remember to teach your children that the rivers are our brothers, and yours, and you must henceforth give the rivers the kindness that you would give my brother. We know that the white man does not understand our ways. One portion of land is the same to him as the next, for he is a stranger who comes in the night and takes from the land whatever he needs. The Earth is not his brother, but his enemy and when he has conquered it, he moves on. He leaves his father's graves behind, and he does not care. He kidnaps the Earth from his children, and he does not care. BIRTHRIGHT His father's grave, and his children's birthright are forgotten. He treats his mother, the Earth, and his brother, the same, as things to be bought, plundered, sold like sheep or bright beads. His appetite will devour the Earth and leave behind only a desert. I do not know. Our ways are different from yours ways. The sight of your cities pains the eyes of the red man. But perhaps it is because the red man is a savage and does not understand. There is no quiet place in the white man's cities. No place to hear the unfurling of leaves in spring, or the rustle of an insect's wings. But perhaps it is because I am a savage and do not understand. The clatter only seems to insult the ears. And what is there to life if a man cannot hear the lonely cry of a whippoorwill or the arguments of the frogs around a pond at night. I am a red man and do not understand. The Indian prefers the soft sound of the wind darting over the face of the pond, and the smell of the wind itself, cleansed by a midday rain, or scented with the pinon pine. PRECIOUS The air is precious to the red man, for all things share the same breath - the beast, the tree, the man, they all share the same breath. The white man does not seem to notice the air he breathes. Like a man dying for many days, he is numb to the stench. But if we sell you our land, you must remember that the air is precious to us, that the air shares its spirit with all the life it supports. The wind that gave our grandfather his first breath also receives his last sigh. And if we sell you our land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place where even the white man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow's flowers. So we will consider your offer to buy our land. If we decide to accept, I will make one condition - the white man must treat the beasts of this land as his brothers. I am a savage and do not understand any other way. I have seen a thousand rotting buffaloes on the prairie, left by the white man who shot them from a passing train. I am a savage and do not understand how the smoking iron horse can be made more important than the buffalo that we kill only to stay alive. What is man without the beasts? If all the beasts were gone, man would die from a great loneliness of the spirit. For whatever happens to the beasts, soon happens to man. All things are connected. RESPECT You must teach your children that the ground beneath their feet is the ashes of our grandfathers. So that they will respect the land, tell your children that the Earth is rich with the lives of our kin. Teach your children what we have taught our children, that the Earth is our mother. Whatever befalls the Earth befalls the sons of the Earth. If men spit upon the ground, they spit upon themselves. This we know - the Earth does not belong to man - man belongs to the Earth. This we know. All things are connected like the blood which unites one family. All things are connected. Whatever befalls the Earth - befalls the sons of the Earth. Man did not weave the web of life - he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself. Even the white man, whose God walks and talks with him as friend to friend, cannot be exempt from the common destiny. We may be brothers after all. We shall see. One thing we know, which the white man may one day discover - Our God is the same God. You may think now that you own Him as you wish to own our land, but you cannot. He is the God of man, and His compassion is equal for red man and the white. The Earth is precious to Him, and to harm the Earth is to heap contempt on its creator. The whites too shall pass, perhaps sooner than all\nother tribes. But in your perishing you will shine brightly, fired by the strength of the God who brought you to this land and for some special purpose gave you dominion over this land and over the red man. That destiny is a mystery to us, for we do not understand when the buffalo are slaughtered, the wild horses tamed, the secret corners of the forest heavy with scent of many men, and the view of the ripe hills blotted by talking wires. Where is the thicket? Gone. Where is the Eagle? Gone. The end of living and the beginning of survival. Chief Seattle\n1854\n Origins:  Though undeniably beautiful, the preceding speech is not even remotely authentic. Rather than issuing from the very real Chief Seattle in 1854, those moving words were written by a screenwriter in 1971. \"Chief Seattle is probably our greatest manufactured prophet,\" said David Buerge, a Northwest historian. The  real Chief Seattle did give a speech in 1854, but he never said \"The earth is our mother.\" Nor did he say \"I have seen a thousand rotting buffaloes on the prairie, left by the white man who shot them from a passing train.\" There were no bison within 600 miles of the chief's home on Puget Sound in the Pacific Northwest, and trains to the West were years away.  The words Chief Seattle has become famous for were written by Ted Perry, the screenwriter for Home, a 1972 film about ecology. They have since been widely quoted in books, on TV, and from the pulpit. A children's book, Brother Eagle, Sister Sky: A Message From Chief Seattle, sold 280,000 within the first six months of its 1991 issue. By most accounts, Chief Seattle was a great speaker and skilled diplomat. He was born in 1786, and his real name in the Lushootseed language was See-ahth. Whites found it nearly impossible to pronounce.  Seattle was also a warrior with a considerable reputation for daring raids on other Indian tribes. After smallpox wiped out many of his people, he realized the inevitability of the coming tide of white settlement. In 1854 he made a speech to more than a thousand of his people gathered to greet the Government's Indian superintendent, Isaac Stevens. Most historians agree that the speech was delivered in the Salish dialect. A year later, the chief signed a treaty with the United States Government, ceding much of the area on which the city of Seattle now stands.  There is only one record of what Chief Seattle did say in 1854, a translation of the chief's speech done by Dr. Henry Smith who published his recollection in 1887  33 years after it was given. According to Smith, Seattle merely praised the generosity of the President in buying his land. Chief Seattle died in 1866, more than a hundred years before the words that would be attributed to him were penned.

            "Activists have called on German prosecutors to move against Haspel, but no warrant has been issued."
        ],
        "justification": "The Trump administration has had its share of embattled nominees, but President Donald Trump's pick to head the Central Intelligence Agency in March 2018 is controversial even by those standards.  Trump nominated the agency's deputy director, Gina Haspel, on 13 March 2018. But her record has come under question both in the U.S. and abroad because of her service while stationed at a secret CIA facility in 2002, leading to allegations that she committed war crimes (with commentary appearing, naturally, in meme form):   A human rights advocacy group  the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR)  has called for Haspel to be taken into custody if she travels to the continent. The group has petitioned federal prosecutors in Germany since 2014 to issue a warrant, saying: saying: Those who commit, order or allow torture should be brought before a court  this is especially true for senior officials from powerful nations. The prosecutor must, under the principle of universal jurisdiction, open investigations, secure evidence and seek an arrest warrant. If the deputy director travels to Germany or Europe, she must be arrested. Andreas Schller, director of the group's International Crimes and Accountability Program, has said that ECCHR does not expect that Haspel will actually face a warrant; its goal, he said, is that German officials recognize Haspel's alleged actions: said If you allow her to come here, you are making a clear political decision that you prioritize that over your obligations under the Convention Against Torture They can't say they didn't know who was coming here. Haspel, who first joined the agency in 1985 during President Ronald Reagan's administration, was reportedly in charge of a secret \"black site\" prison in Thailand at which a prisoner and terror suspect, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, was waterboarded. She also allegedly supported the destruction of videotapes in 2005 capturing waterboardings at the prison. (However, a report stating that she was in charge of the facility, code-named \"Cat's Eye,\" at the time another suspect, Abu Zubaydah, was tortured was retracted.) reportedly retracted. The use of waterboarding  or \"enhanced interrogation,\" as officials called it at the time  was banned in 2009 by President Barack Obama. Five years later, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report criticizing the practice. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California), who was the committee chair at the time, wrote in the foreword to the report: banned report CIA personnel, aided by two outside contractors, decided to initiate a program of indefinite secret detention and the use of brutal interrogation techniques in violation of U.S. law, treaty obligations, and our values. In March 2018, Feinstein called on the agency to declassify documents related to Haspel's role in the program: called As we move forward with the nomination process for Ms. Haspel, my fellow Senators and I must have the complete picture of Ms. Haspel's involvement in the program in order to fully and fairly review her record and qualifications. I also believe the American people deserve to know the actual role the person nominated to be the director of the CIA played in what I consider to be one of the darkest chapters in American history. Two of Feinstein's GOP Senate colleagues, Rand Paul of Kentucky and John McCain of Arizona, have also called for Haspel to explain how involved she was with the agency's interrogation program while it was active.

        "justification": "Claim:   According to magazine polls, the three things blacks fear most are dogs, ghosts, and registered mail. FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, March 2008] \nTwo different magazines, Country Living (99.99% white readership) and EBONY/Jet (99.99% black readership) did surveys on 'WHAT DO PEOPLE FEAR MOST'? The results were interesting, to say the least... Country Living magazine's top three answers were:\n1. Nuclear war/terrorist attack in U.S.\n2. Child/spouse dying/terminal illness.\n3. Terminal illness/self. EBONY/Jet magazine's top three answers were:\n1. Ghosts.\n2. Dogs.\n3. Registered mail. Variations:  A February 2010 version added two more items to each list:  Country Living:\n4.  Unemployment.\n5.  Further economic downturn. Ebony / Jet:\n4.  Law enforcement.\n5.  Father's Day. Origins:  Variously titled \"Interesting Survey Results\" and \"What Do People Fear Most?\", this canard about magazines surveying what their readers fear most has been landing in our inbox since March 2008. None of the publications named therein  Country Living, Ebony, or Jet  ran such a survey and obtained the listed results. Country Living Gardening, decor, entertaining, crafts, and antiques are the primary areas of interest covered by Country Living, which would make such a poll appear to be an especially bad fit for that publication.  (Ebony and Jet cover a wider range of topics. While Ebony and Jet are different magazines that service a primarily black readership, they are both produced by Johnson Publishing and share a joint web site, ebonyjet.com.) ebonyjet.com The racial denigration in the piece is obvious: When white folks worry, they concern themselves with weighty matters (nuclear war, terrorist attack, loss of loved ones, their own mortality), but when black people fret, their anxiety focuses on far less dire things (ghosts, dogs, registered mail). Moreover, says the fake poll, the fears of white people mostly involve dangers that threaten others as well as themselves, but black people worry about things that are strictly limited to the individual. Black people are therefore not only laughably trivial in their concerns, but also wholly self-involved. Yet the racism doesn't stop there: The three things blacks supposedly fear most are also all items associated with racial stereotypes. Ghosts are on the list because among the many negative characteristics attributed to blacks that worked to position them as childish was a purported terror of \"haunts\" or \"spooks.\" (This stereotype was so widely accepted that it found its way into numerous films made in the 1930s and 1940s.) Man's best friend makes the list because dogs were used to track escaped slaves and run them to the ground, and in more recent times by police to break up civil rights marches and protests. Puzzling to some readers is the inclusion of \"registered mail\" on the list. That entry presupposes the only kind of mail a black person would have to sign for is the sort no one would want to receive: dunning letters from collection agencies and lawyers, summonses to appear in court, formal demands for overdue child support, and the like. (White folks apparently get only the good kind of registered mail, such as secure delivery of their stock certificates or news of bequests left them in dear old Uncle Egbert's will.)

        ],
        "justification": "Photographs purportedly showing the skeletons of fairies, dragons, werewolves and other mythical creatures at the \"Merrylin Cryptid Museum\" were appeared in May 2016, featured on web sites such as Ufunk.net and Metro:  Merrylin Cryptid Museum Ufunk.net Metro   Creepy skeletons of winged humans, bodies of mythical creatures and even aliens have been unearthed in a London home. The ghastly relics were the collection of Thomas Merrylin, an 18th century aristocrat with a taste for the unusual. They were apparently found sealed in the basement of a London house in 2006, and the macabre findings might just change science as we know it. Now theyre being kept at the Merrylin Cryptid Museum, a bizarre collection of the artefacts that is almost guaranteed to creep you out. The \"Merrylin Cryptid Museum\" claims that its specimens were collected by famed \"Crypto-naturalist\" Thomas Merrylin in the 1800s. \"Curator\" Alex CF writes on the museum's web site that not only did Merrylin have a knack for uncovering imaginary creatures, but that he also resisted aging: web site A bizarre quality of Merrylin was his apparent permanent youthfulness. Even in his 80s, he still resembled a 40 year old, albeit of odd complexion, and his few bizarre forays into the eyes of the media only furthered his infamy. He was accused of practicing dark arts to prolong his life. Yet, eminent scholars secretly allied themselves with him, encouraging him to share his collection with the world. In 1899, he took a small portion of his specimens on tour across America. Conservative attitudes of the time condemned these creatures, calling them blasphemous. His reaction was severe and the tour was canceled before it reached California. A video that appeared to show the museum was published on Vimeo in 2014, deepening the mystery:  Despite the claims made in this video, we found no record of an ageless cryptologist named \"Professor Thomas Theodore Merrylin\" that wasn't associated with this museum. Furthermore, in addition to his duties as \"curator\" at the \"Merrylin Cryptid Museum,\" Alex CF is also an illustrator, artist, and sculptor who specializes in dark folklore and animal mythology: Alex CF Alex is a London based illustrator, writer and sculptor. His work is visceral and whimsical, creating elaborate detailed depictions of earthen ritual, dark folklore and forgotten horrors. His frenetic lines and beautiful depictions can be seen on band artwork, record labels and book covers alongside his own personal projects.  His personal artwork is inspired by animal mythology, the concepts of imbuing non humans with cultural, religious and ritualistic practices, creating fantastical naturalist scenes, with much of his personal illustrations connected by stories within a single narrative. He writes and draws to create little worlds so that the drawings have a substance beyond the aesthetic, by incorporating ideology and symbology to encourage the viewer to consider the connections between humans and non humans. He has just finished writing his first novel, 'Seek the throat from which we sing.' The ageless cryptologist Thomas Merrylin is an intriguing, but fictional, character. The specimens he supposedly found do not showcase the skeletal structures of fairies, dragons, and other mythical creatures; the entire creation  from the museum, to the backstory, to the video, to the skeletons themselves  is the work of a particularly imaginative artist.

It also explains the lawsuit, your legal rights under the settlement, what benefits are available to you under the settlement, and how to get them.\n  Origins:  In 2002,  lawsuits were filed against PayPal, alleging (among other issues) that PayPal illegitimately restricted customers' access to their money: lawsuits \n\nFiled in California Superior Court in Santa Clara County, the suit charges PayPal with illegitimately restricting customers' access to their money. PayPal frequently locks customers' accounts if it suspects that fraud played a part in a transaction, even if the amount in doubt is a fraction of the total amount in an account, said Gail Koff, an attorney and founding partner of Jacoby & Meyers, which filed the lawsuit.  The result is that customers can't accept any more payments via PayPal, pay anyone through the service, or withdraw any of their money until PayPal clears the transaction. That can often take days or even weeks, customers charge.  \"Under the guise of needing to protect consumers from fraud, they themselves are guilty of fraudulent abuse of their customers,\" Koff said\nPayPal\n Those lawsuits were settled in June 2004: settled \n\nPayPal has reached a preliminary settlement with some customers who accused the eBay unit of illegally freezing their funds.  The company said it will pay a total of $9.25 million to settle the federal class-action suit, $3.4 million of which will pay lawyers' fees and costs.  PayPal admitted no wrongdoing in settling the claims, which were filed in 2002 as part of two federal class-action suits that also alleged other customer service deficiencies. Those two cases were merged, and a third case, pending in California state court, will be dismissed if the settlement agreement is approved. \"In this agreement, PayPal does not acknowledge that any of the allegations in the case are true,\" PayPal said in an e-mail to customers. The unit \"entered into the settlement agreement to avoid further costs of litigation and to devote resources to more productive areas of our business.\"\n The PayPal site now includes a link which users can follow to view the site hosted by the claims administrator for the class action settlement and learn more about the litigation and class action settlement agreement.  link PayPal customers who used the service between Oct. 1, 1999 and Jan. 31, 2004 are eligible to file and claim a portion of the approximately $5.8 million settle disbursement.

WAS PARTLY TRUE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, April 2009] \nPLEASE PASS ON! THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSIST THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES\nWHO WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REPAIR OR PURCHASE GLASSES FOR CHILDREN. In case you have a child or know of someone who does (ages 12 and under),\nthey can get a FREE pair of eyeglasses from Target: Target is doing a special promotion for their optical service. It could\nend any time but will definitely end no later than April 29th. Children\n12 and under can get a free pair of glasses. They need to bring in a valid\nprescription for glasses from their doctor and Target will let the child\npick from about 40 different frames. They will place their best lenses in\nthe frames which are non-glare and scratch resistant and normally sell for\n$200.00. There are no income guidelines. Any child 12 or under is\neligible. You can find stores with optical departments at www.target.com to confirm\nthey are participating before making a trip to their store. Please pass this information on to anyone who can benefit from this\npromotional offer. If you know someone with lost or broken glasses please\nshare this information with them ASAP, as the promotion could end at anytime.\nThey would like families to come in as soon as they can.\n Origins:  Unfortunately, during troubled economic times ordinary (i.e., non-urgent) health care is one of the first things many families have to eliminate from their budgets  not just routine doctor visits, but also regular dental and optical checkups may go by the wayside, especially among families who have no insurance to cover such services. The claim that Target stores with optical departments are offering free eyeglasses (frames and lenses) to children 12 and under would therefore seem to be a  welcome announcement to many parents: It would mean they could get their children's existing eyeglasses replaced for free, and even if they had to pay for optical exams to obtain new or updated eye prescriptions for their children, they could rest assured that those prescriptions would be filled free at Target for children 12 and under. Sounds too good to be true?  That's what we thought, especially when we noted that the Optical section of Target's web site makes no mention of any such promotion. (They merely offer coupons for discounts on glasses, contacts, and premium lenses.)   Optical coupons So, we contacted Target's Customer Relations department to ask about this promotion and were told that they were offering such a deal, but only in a very limited sense.  The \"free eyeglasses to children 12 and under\" promotion was a pilot program currently available only in a few stores in select areas (e.g., Kansas City, Kansas).  However, that pilot program has now ended, as a Target Optical marketing manager communicated to us on 10 April 2009: \n\nFree Kids Eyeglasses Promotion At Target Optical, we believe strongly in our value, product and services and wanted to introduce Target Shoppers to the unique shopping experience\nthat we offer.  So, to introduce more Target Shoppers to our stores, during the month of March we offered families a way to try Target Optical\nfor free through our Free Kids Eyeglasses promotion. The Free Kids Eyeglasses promotion is now over.  It was a limited time offer in seven stores within the greater Kansas City area. We were pleased\nto distribute over 1,000 pairs of free children's eyeglasses during this event.\n Last updated:  10 April 2009\n ",

John ended up getting convicted of Aggravated Sexual Assault Of A Child in the state of Texas... ... Texas Department Of Public Safety Sex Offender Registry Records reveal that John sexually assaulted a 4 year old female child and that he was sentenced to 5 years in prison, was released on parole and is now under a lifetime mandatory supervision by the state of Texas.   A man named John Bernard Williams truly is on the Texas Public Sex Offender registry. We also found that much of the known biographical information for \"John-John\" matched with the information of this offender from the Texas Department of Public Safety. the Texas Public Sex Offender For instance, a profile on \"Airman John-John\" published by the Air Force Service Information and News Center in 1989 identified him as \"John Bernard Williams.\" That article also identified his mother by the first name of \"Trina.\" This is also the name of convicted sex offender John Bernard Williams' mother, according to a 2000 opinion on Williams' court case.

The Muppet Fandom Wiki provides a more specific date of birth for John-John (Sept. 24, 1969), but we have been unable to verify this information. If this information is accurate, though, John-John and John Bernard Williams share the exact same birth date. If it's inaccurate, we still know that they were born in the same year. reported Muppet Fandom Wiki Lastly, in 1998, The New York Times caught up with John-John for the 30th anniversary of \"Sesame Street.\" That article noted that John-John was living in San Antonio, Texas. A year later, charges would be filed against a man named John Bernard Williams in Bexar County, where San Antonio is located, for the sexual assault of a child. San Antonio, Texas. The information we've gathered seems to show that John-John, the 2-year-old child who made multiple appearances on \"Sesame Street,\" may be the same person who ended up on the offender list in Texas. However, it is possible that this is just a coincidence. Given the nature of the rumor, and the fact that we have been unable to definitively tie these two identities together (via family statements, social security numbers, fingerprints, etc.) we are rating this claim \"Unproven.\" We've reached out to the Texas Department Of Public Safety and will update this article if more information becomes available.

        "justification": "On Nov. 29, 2020, a Facebook page purporting to represent Costco, a chain of membership-only warehouse stores, posted a message offering a free grocery box to anyone who shared and commented on their post. The message was purportedly written by Costco's CEO Craig Jelinek (whose name was misspelled \"Jelinekand\" in this scam Facebook post due to a typo): message My name is Craig Jelinekand I'm the CEO of Costco Inc. To celebrate our 35th Birthday, Every single person who shaes and comments in the next 24hrs will get one of these Christmas Food Box delivered straight to their door on Monday 30th November. Each Food box contains groceries worth of $250 and a $35 Costco voucher. Make sure you validate your entry. Limit 1 Food box per person.   This message was not posted on Costco's official page and it was not written by the company's CEO. This is a scam that was shared by an imposter Facebook page. A nearly identical version of this scam (with Aldi swapped in for Costco) was also shared on social media in November 2020.  Costco has not commented on this scam offer yet, but Aldi posted a message to Facebook alerting their customers about the scam: Facebook Hey ALDI fans! Looks like another Facebook scam is making its way around. We can confirm it is a scam and the page has no affiliation with ALDI. We're sorry for any confusion this may have caused!\nWe have been working with Facebook since yesterday to get the page taken down, but we'd love your help! Please share this post to help us spread the word and always be sure to look for the blue check mark by our name for authenticity! One indication that this \"free Costco grocery box\" offer is a scam is that it did not originate on Costco's Facebook page. Rather, this message was shared to a page called \"Costco US,\" whereas Costco's real page is called \"Costco.\" Here's a screenshot of the real page (left) that has a verified symbol and the fake page (right), which does not.  Costco   Social media users could have also clicked the \"Page Transparency\" button on Facebook to unearth some more details about this fake page. In this case, the page transparency button reveals that the scam \"Costco US\" page was created on Nov. 29, the same day that this \"free grocery box\" scam started to circulate. It would be unusual, to say the least, for Costco to start an entirely new page (one that its shoppers do not know about) in order to host a giveaway.    A reverse image search on the included photos also shows that this page is not on the up-and-up. The image supposedly showing \"free Costco grocery boxes\" is actually several years old and did not originally show boxes adorned with the \"Costco\" logo. The original image (below) shows plain cardboard boxes. The scammers inserted a digital version of the Costco logo in order to make it seem like the store was truly giving away boxes of groceries. A similar scam involving the grocery store Aldi also used a doctored version of this image: several years old similar scam   The best way to tell that this offer is a scam, however, is to ask yourself a simple question: Does it seem too good to be true?  This type of scam is commonplace on social media. A fraudulent page (in this case a fake Costco page) posts an especially appealing offer (free grocery boxes) and then asks social media users to like, share, or comment on the post. This ensures that the scam message will spread to as many people as possible, which gives the fraudsters a better chance of success. \"Success,\" in this case, is people being tricked into parting with personal information, such as email addresses, passwords, or credit card numbers.  We've had many occasions to alert readers to this kind of fraud: These types of viral coupon scams often involve websites and social media pages set up to mimic those of legitimate companies. Users who respond to those fake offers are required to share a website link or social media post in order to spread the scam more widely and lure in additional victims. Then those users are presented with a survey that extracts personal information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and even sometimes credit card numbers. Finally, those who want to claim their free gift cards or coupons eventually learn they must first sign up to purchase a number of costly goods, services, or subscriptions.

        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Crowbars are so named because they were devices used to perform menial labor assigned to blacks.  \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [The Atlantic Monthly, 2003] \n\n\nI was told that the term 'crowbar' was racist.  My co-worker said it was derived from 'Jim Crow,' and that the device was named as such because it was used for menial labor. He said the appropriate term was 'prybar.'1\n\n\n Origins:  Once again rumor brings forth  an attempt to eradicate unsavory aspects of our racial history through the purging of vocabulary, undeterred by the fact that the origins of the word to be eliminated have nothing to do with any aspect of racism. The use of the word 'crow' to describe an iron bar, usually with one end slightly bent and sharpened, is documented in English as far back as the year 1400. The device was so named because its splayed end resembled a crow's beak or foot; by the mid-18th century it was known as a 'crow bar,' and by the mid-19th century the two words had been joined to form 'crow-bar' and then finally 'crowbar.' The use of the word 'crow' as a slang or pejorative reference to blacks didn't occur until three centuries later, however, and the term 'Jim Crow' not until another century after that.  Blacks were first called 'crows' in the 1730s,2 and the popularization of that term was almost certainly the progenitor of the 'Jim Crow' character created a hundred years later: \n\nThe term likely originated with a song introduced by blackface minstrel Thomas D. Rice about 1828. \"Jim Crow,\" sung and danced by Rice in the United States and England, has as its introduction: \nCome, listen all you gals and boys,\nI'se just from Tucky hoe;\nI'm goin' to sing a little song;\nMy name's Jim Crow.  The chorus ran:  First on de heel tap, den on de toe,\nEbery time I wheel about I jump Jim Crow.\nWheel about and turn about and do jis so,\nAnd ebery time I wheel about I jump Jim Crow.\n Rice is said to have patterned his song and dance on that of an old Kentucky field hand he had observed. His routine became so familiar that a few years later an antislavery book was titled The History of Jim Crow and it is from such uses of Jim Crow to signify \"Negro\" that the discriminatory laws and practices take their name, though the first such laws were not enacted until 1875.3\n Although 'crowbar' and 'Jim Crow' share a common root, neither term was derived from or references the other.  Crowbars are simply tools, not linguistic remnants of a racist heritage. Last updated:  12 July 2007\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n  Ammer, Christine.

One common method such predators use is establishing fake Facebook accounts mimicking those of well-known vendors of consumer products (typically of the edible variety, such as Starbucks, Taco Bell, McDonald's, KFC, Wendy's, Burger King, Whole Foods, Safeway, Food Lion, and Little Caesars) and posting bogus offers for \"lifetime passes\" or other dispensations of free product as part of a supposed company anniversary or birthday celebration (e.g., \"Starbucks is giving away free lifetimes in celebration of the brand's 44th anniversary\"). The primary type of free product fraud is the \"sweepstakes scam,\" which is intended to lure victims into completing numerous surveys, disclosing a good deal of personal information, and then agreeing to sign up for costly, difficult-to-cancel \"Reward Offers\" hidden in the fine print. The scammers spread links via e-mail and Facebook that purport to offer free product to those who follow those links. These web pages (which are not operated or sponsored by the companies they reference) typically ask the unwary to click what appear to be Facebook \"share\" buttons and post comments to the scammer's site (which is really a ruse to dupe users into spreading the scam by sharing it with all of their Facebook friends). Those who follow such instructions are then led into a set of pages prompting them to input a fair amount of personal information (including name, age, address, and phone numbers), complete a lengthy series of surveys, and finally sign up (and commit to paying) for at least two \"Reward Offers\" (e.g., Netflix subscriptions, credit report monitoring services, prepaid credit cards): Pursuant to the Terms & Conditions, you are required to complete 2 of the Reward Offers from the above. You will need to meet all of the terms and conditions to qualify for the shipment of the reward. For credit card offers, you must activate your card by making a purchase, transferring a balance, or making a cash advance. For loan offers you must close and fund the loan. For home security and satellite tv offers you must have the product installed. You may not cancel your participation in more than a total of 2 Reward Offers within 30 days of any Reward Offer Sign-Up Date as outlined in the Terms & Conditions (the Cancellation Limit). Not only that, but the fine print on the \"free\" product offers typically states that by accepting its terms, the user agrees to receive telemarketing phone calls and text messages from a variety of different companies:   Similar phony free product lures are used to spread malware. In those versions of the scam, those who attempt to reach the URL provided for the purpose of claiming the free products are instead victimized by a Facebook \"lifejacking\" attack, a malicious script that takes over a user's Facebook profile without their knowledge and propagates itself to their friends' accounts as well. lifejacking In short, those who seek \"free\" merchandise generally end up paying a dear cost for it.",

        "justification": "FACT CHECK: Was a tweet sent by journalist Chris Hurst about the death of his girlfriend Alison Parker published before the shooting occurred?  Claim: A tweet sent by journalist Chris Hurst about the death of his girlfriend Alison Parker was published before the shooting occurred.   FALSE Examples: [Collected via e-mail and YouTube, August 2015] There's a big buzz about the tweet of Chris Hurst, the VA news reporter's fiance', that is said to have a 6:34am timestamp, while the shooting video has a time of 6:45am. Many are saying it's all a fake, a false flag, just the government trying to push for gun control, etc. And saying the woman's father didn't show \"enough emotion\", being more intent on his urging for more gun laws. Please look into this, so all this alternative reality noise can end. ...you'll see all the pushback on Chris Hurst's twitter page, as well  https://twitter.com/chrishurstwdbj/status/636532144966365184 And on the twitter page, it shows the tweet with a 10:34am time on it, which the naysayers would simply say is a cover-up after the fact.\n\nThis cannot be an error. Time Stamps cannot lie. They both lived and worked and were in the same time zone. I guess this is another FALSE FLAG. There are no timezone errors. Google the time of shootings and they will show it occured at 6:45 am. Even Google 6:45 am and tons of news reports stated that was the time.\n This cannot be an error. Time Stamps cannot lie. They both lived and worked and were in the same time zone. I guess this is another FALSE FLAG. There are no timezone errors. Google the time of shootings and they will show it occured at 6:45 am. Even Google 6:45 am and tons of news reports stated that was the time.  Origins: In the early morning hours 26 August 2015, journalists Alison Parker and Adam Ward of television station WDBJ were shot and killed in the course of filming an otherwise routine live segment at Smith Mountain Lake in Moneta, Virginia. Parker, 24, and Ward, 27, died at the scene; Vicki Gardner (who was being interviewed by Parker at the time of the shooting) was wounded but survived. Ward was live on-air when the gunman (later identified as 41-year-old Vester Lee Flanagan, known professionally as \"Bryce Williams\") began shooting at approximately 6:46 AM. The initial chaotic moments of gunfire were aired live to viewers before the broadcast switched over to anchor Kimberly McBroom (visibly shaken by the unfolding events). Flanagan uploaded footage he captured of the shootings to his social media accounts, and although those videos were later removed, individual users had by then captured and shared them. Among the details that emerged after the shooting were personal tidbits about Parker and Ward, both of whom were romantically involved with fellow WDBJ employees. Ward was engaged to producer Melissa Ott, and Parker lived with fellow anchor Chris Hurst (though the pair had kept their relationship quiet prior the shooting).  After Ott and Hurst learned of the tragic incident, both took to social media to acknowledge the sudden deaths of their significant others. Hurst expressed his grief in a series of tweets:   \n\nWe didn't share this publicly, but @AParkerWDBJ7 and I were very much in love. We just moved in together. I am numb. pic.twitter.com/tUrHVwAXcN\n Chris Hurst (@chrishurstwdbj) August 26, 2015\n \nWe were together almost nine months. It was the best nine months of our lives. We wanted to get married.We just celebrated her 24th birthday\n Chris Hurst (@chrishurstwdbj) August 26, 2015\n   Soon after the shooting was reported, a number of social media users weighed in on the events. Some of those users opined that the high-profile murders were a \"false flag\" event perpetrated to create support for gun control measures. To support that assertion, users pointed to timestamps on screenshots of Hurst's tweets that indicated they were published at 6:31 and 6:32 AM respectively (more than ten minutes before shots were fired at Parker and Ward): We didn't share this publicly, but @AParkerWDBJ7 and I were very much in love. We just moved in together. I am numb. pic.twitter.com/tUrHVwAXcN @AParkerWDBJ7 pic.twitter.com/tUrHVwAXcN  Chris Hurst (@chrishurstwdbj) August 26, 2015 August 26, 2015   We were together almost nine months. It was the best nine months of our lives. We wanted to get married.We just celebrated her 24th birthday  Chris Hurst (@chrishurstwdbj) August 26, 2015 August 26, 2015   As seen above, it's true that Hurst's tweet displayed a timestamp of 6:32 AM ... when viewed from a Twitter account set to Pacific Daylight Time (such as @Snopes, which is set to PDT). But when viewed from a Twitter account whose location is set to the same time zone in which Hurst was located, the tweet looked like this: Hurst's tweet @Snopes Since the attacks of 9/11 (and subsequent \"inside job\" conspiracy theories), the specter of false flag attacks has risen after nearly all high-profile incidents of violence: a mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado was rumored to have been staged, the Boston Marathon bombings inspired rumors of the same type, and the Sandy Hook massacre was fraught with perceived \"inconsistencies\" in the \"official narrative\" of the tragedy. 9/11 inside job Aurora Boston Marathon Sandy Hook massacre While several threads of speculation about the Virginia shooting have since circulated, the timestamp rumor is by far the most prominent (despite the alacrity with which it could be dismissed). It's true that users on the West Coast will see Hurst's tweet with a timestamp out of line with the timeline of the shooting, but that curiosity is simply due to the fact it occurred at 6:46 EDT (or 3:46 AM PDT).

To support that assertion, users pointed to timestamps on screenshots of Hurst's tweets that indicated they were published at 6:31 and 6:32 AM respectively (more than ten minutes before shots were fired at Parker and Ward):",

            "A social media post claimed Levi's jeans' \"two horse\" logo was a racist symbol representing a slave's being killed."
        ],
        "justification": "A viral post claiming that the logo for the Levi's brand of jean represents a slave being torn apart by horses likely refers to a speech ostensibly delivered by William Lynch on the bank of the James River in Virginia in 1712 to a group of slave owners: \nMUST READ!!!!! I'm Done Wearing \"Levi Jeans\". This was just brought to my attention, Back in slavery days they would \"Beat\" and \"Kill\" the strongest Black Man On The Plantation. They would do so in front of his family and every other slaves on the plantation. After He'd been beaten, they would tie two \"ROPES\" one to each of his \"LEGS\" and those ropes were tied to \"TWO HORSES\" they would then proceed to beat the horses making them run in opposite directions. Eventually the horses would rip his legs from his body...... The Logo on \"Levi Jeans\" shows how this process went. You see the two \"Slave\" owners whipping the horses and the ropes visibly connected from the horses to the mans legs. It's supposed to be amusing and to show how hard it would be to actually tear a pair of these jeans that's why the words \"Quality Clothing\" appears over both of the horses. Smh I've been wearing these jeans for years, WELL NOT ANYMORE! \n While many historians believe that reports of this speech are a hoax, it is widely shared as an accurate depiction of how slave owners attempted to control their slaves: \"Take the meanest and most restless (slave), strip him of his clothes in front of the remaining male (slaves), the female, and the (slave)infant, tar and feather him, tie each leg to a different horse faced in opposite directions, set him a fire and beat both horses to pull him apart in front of the remaining (slaves).\" speech While those tactics might possibly have been employed by some slave owners at the time, no evidence suggests the Levi's jeans logo is an homage to this horrible concept. The primary selling point of the pants manufactured by the company Levi Strauss founded in 1853 was that they were not subject to tearing as other manufacturer's pants were due to the company's use of patented copper rivets to reinforce points of strain where pants typically tore, primarily the pocket corners and the base of the button fly.  The Levi's \"two horse\" logo was created in 1886 in an attempt to illustrate that most important of selling points to 19th century buyers: created Recognize the animals above? They've been part of the Levi's brand since 1886. But what you see here is something new  the freshest version of what we call the Two Horse patch. When you're a company that prides itself on both heritage and innovation, you want to tell that story as vividly and compellingly as possible. And for us, the Two Horse logo does just that. As the company Historian, let me share a bit of history. In 1873, Jacob Davis and company founder Levi Strauss invented the first blue jeans using their patented process of securing clothing at \"points of strain\" with rivets. The result: strong jeans that could stand up to the hard work thrown at them by miners and other hard-working individuals of the time. Levi Strauss & Co. knew the patent would expire in 1890, so we needed to quickly make sure consumers understood how good  and strong  the company's jeans were. But how do you tell that story in a way that consumers could quickly grasp? Well, one of the answers was the image of two horses  each pulling in the opposite direction on the same pair of jeans, trying in vain to tear them apart. Given that the Levi Strauss clothing company's original location and market base was an area of the United States where slavery was not legal (the company was founded in California, a free state, which was bordered by other non-slave states and territories), it's unlikely Levi Strauss would have depended upon his customer base's recognizing a supposed Southern plantation slavery practice to understand the brand's logo.  All the more so since the logo wasn't even unveiled until more than twenty years after slavery had been abolished all throughout the United States. Also note that in the Levi's logo, the ropes leading from the horses are attached to the hip area of the pants  if the image were supposed to be a literal graphical representation of pulling a man's legs apart, the ropes would be tied much farther down on the legs  (below the knee, close to the ankle).  As noted above, the image is intended to reinforce Levi Strauss' patented rivet solution to one of the most troublesome points of tearing in pants, the pocket corners (which are up near the hips, not down the leg): Levi Strauss took Facebook in an attempt to dispel this rumor: Facebook   The Levi's \"two horse\" logo symbolizes nothing more sinister than Levi's original rivet patent and the attendant strength of their jeans.",

        ],
        "justification": "The item reproduced below originated as an e-mail sent to radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh in July 2010 by Dr. Sebastian J. Ciancio, a urologist practicing in Danville, Illinois. In that e-mail, the doctor encouraged the radio host to \"share this story with your listeners so that they know how the ruling class spends their tax dollars.\" In this example collected from the Snopes inbox in August 2010: I was speaking to an emergency room physician this morning. He told me that a woman in her 20's came to the ER with her 8th pregnancy. She stated \"my momma told me that I am the breadwinner for the family.\" He asked her to explain. She said that she can make babies and babies get money for the family. The scam goes like this: The grandma calls the Department of Children and Family Services and states that the unemployed daughter is not capable of caring for these children. DCFS agrees and states that the child or children will need to go to foster care. The grandma then volunteers to be the foster parent, and thus receives a check for $1500 per child per month in Illinois. Total yearly income: $144,000 tax-free, not to mention free healthcare (Medicaid) plus a monthly \"Link\" card entitling her to free groceries, etc, and a voucher for 250 free cell phone minutes per month. This does not even include WIC and other welfare programs. Indeed, grandma was correct in that her fertile daughter is the \"breadwinner\" in the family. Variations: In December 2010 the following photograph was added to circulating versions of this item, even though the pictured family has no connection to the story and no mention of race appeared in the original text:  In 2014, the setting was moved from Illinois to Florida. The gist of this \"story\" is the claim that an Illinois woman who was pregnant with her eighth child (while still in her 20's) admitted to an emergency room physician that she was deliberately having children and giving them up to foster care in order to earn money for her family, with her grandmother volunteering to raise the children and collecting $1,500 per month from the state for each child, for an annual tax-free income of $144,000 (plus additional benefits). Is the story true? It's a second-hand account, and Dr. Ciancio declined to identify the physician who supposedly told it to him, which makes verification of that aspect of the tale difficult. Nonetheless, whatever a pregnant patient may have told an unnamed emergency room physician, the scenario described simply isn't possible. According to payment rates published by the State of Illinois' Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), monthly payments for licensed relative home care range from $384 to $471 per child, depending upon the age of the child: payment rates  The maximum monthly payment (for a child age 12 and over) is $471 per month, not $1,500 per month, so the largest amount of money a foster parent caring for eight children would receive in a month (assuming all of those children were at least 12 years old) would be $3,768, for an annual total of $45,216  a far cry from the $144,000 yearly income claimed above. (And even the $45,216 figure is a generous projection, given that it's an obvious impossibility for a woman who is pregnant with her eighth child to already have eight children all over the age of twelve.)\n Pickel, Mary Lou.  \"Tea Party at the Capitol.\"\r\n  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  28 February 2009.",

        ],
        "justification": "Cinco de Mayo and St. Patrick's Day share many common elements from an American perspective: Although neither is a legal holiday in the United States, they are both nonetheless widely observed as celebrations of another nation's culture, both occasions are marked with parties featuring national music and cuisine (and involving a good deal of drinking), both events have become heavily commercialized, and most Americans have little idea what either holiday is actually about. St. Patrick's Day little idea either holiday Many Americans mistakenly believe that Cinco de Mayo (\"May 5th\") is the Mexican equivalent of the United States' Fourth of July holiday  a date marking the official casting off of colonial rule via the announcement of a new independent country. However, the Mexican version of Independence Day is celebrated on September 16, for it was on that date in 1810 that the commencement of the war for Mexican independence from Spanish rule was pronounced in the small town of Dolores by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla -- an event now referred to as the \"Grito de Dolores\" (\"Cry of Dolores\") or \"El Grito de la Independencia\". Grito What Cinco de Mayo really commemorates is the Mexican victory against French forces led by Emperor Napoleon III in the Battle of Puebla, which took place on 5 May 1862. The French had invaded Mexico at Veracruz in 1861 (while the United States was preoccupied with its own Civil War) with the intent of establishing a dominance in Mexico that would favor French interests.  After beating President Benito Jurez and his government into retreat, the French army moved on from Veracruz toward Mexico City, where they encountered heavy resistance from Mexican forces just outside the city of Puebla. Despite possessing an overpowering superiority in weaponry and numbers (6,000 well-armed French troops battled 2,000 poorly-equipped Mexican troops), the French were forced to retreat after a full day of fighting. Although the French later overran Puebla, conquered Mexico City, and installed Emperor Maximilian I as ruler of Mexico, the Mexican victory at the Battle of Puebla was celebrated for its importance in symbolizing Mexican unity, pride, and determination in the face of overwhelming odds. (The event is roughly equivalent in national lore to the American celebration of the Battle of the Alamo: although the Texan defenders of the Alamo Mission near San Antonio de Bxar were decisively defeated by Mexican forces in 1836, the tenacity and courage of the 200 or so combatants who fought to their deaths against about 1,800 Mexican troops served as inspiration for the Texan defeat of the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto a few months later.) The other common misconception about Cinco de Mayo among Americans is that if the holiday is so well known here in the U.S., it must be a really big deal in Mexico itself. But Cinco de Mayo is not a national holiday in Mexico: It is celebrated in Mexico, but it's only an official holiday in the Mexican states of Puebla and Veracruz, and the biggest Cinco de Mayo celebrations typically occur not in Mexico but in U.S. cities with large Hispanic populations such as Los Angeles. And just as St. Patrick's Day has long been observed throughout America in areas without significant Irish populations, Cinco de Mayo is now also commonly celebrated in towns across the U.S. that are predominantly non-Hispanic.",

Forgive any crossposting if you've seen this, but it's that important. **PLEASE DO NOT DELETE,**  TAKE THE TIME TO  WATCH THIS VIDEO, IT MAY JUST SAVE YOUR LIFE. Then please forward this to your wives, girlfriends, mothers, sisters, every woman you know! If we dont share it, some people may never hear about this until it is too late.   It's one of the most aggressive forms of Breast Cancer known but most aren't aware of it including physicians. I've no idea how common or rare it is but something to absolutely be aware of!  3 of 4 cancer groups/help lines had never heard of it, including the Susan Koman center (but do now and will add it). THE SILENT KILLER!! The silent killer - IBC - Inflammatory Breast Cancer. No lump needed for detection and won't show up on mammograms and suggested an MRI with certain signs. (in video) (Ruthiema as 'you' suggested too) *sigh* PLEASE, click the attached link (or paste in browser)\nhttps://ww3.komotv.com/global/video/popup/pop_player.asp?ClipID1=785456& https://ww3.komotv.com/global/video/popup/pop_player.asp?ClipID1=785456& I am totally shocked myself to hear of this and completely unaware of it as well,  yet some signs are obvious yet often considered 'bug bites' or just a 'hot spot' inverted nipples, persistent itching and more.  Origins:  According to the National Cancer Institute, Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an uncommon type of breast cancer in which breast cancer cells block the lymph vessels in the skin of the breast, a type of breast cancer that may not be apparent through routine screening methods (e.g., feeling for lumps, mammograms): \n\nThis blockage may cause the breast to become red, swollen, and warm. The skin of the breast may also appear pink, purple, or bruised, and it may have ridges or appear pitted, like the skin of an orange (called peau d'orange). These changes often occur quickly over a period of weeks. Another possible sign of this type of breast cancer is swollen lymph nodes under the arm, above the collarbone, or in both places. Often, a tumor cannot be felt, and may not be seen on a mammogram. The diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer is based on the results of the biopsy and the doctor's clinical judgment.\n\n According to the Mayo Clinic, signs and symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer include: \n A breast that appears red, purple, pink or bruised\n A tender, firm and enlarged breast \n A warm feeling in the breast \n Itching of the breast \n Pain \n Ridged or dimpled skin texture, similar to an orange peel \nThickened areas of skin \n Enlarged lymph nodes under the arm, above the collarbone or below the collarbone \n Flattening or retraction of the nipple \n Swollen or crusted skin on the nipple \n Change in color of the skin around the nipple (areola) \n Inflammatory breast cancer is of particular concern because it progresses rapidly, and in most women it is already quite advanced before the symptoms become severe enough for them to seek medical attention.  IBC was previously treated through surgery and was almost always fatal; nowadays, additional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy have greatly increased the chances of survival for IBC patients.

Claim:  A Southern Baptist pastor criticized the actions of Kentucky clerk Kim Davis in a Facebook status update.   CORRECTLY ATTRIBUTED Example:   [Collected via Facebook, September 2015] Since I am a pastor of a southern Baptist church please allow me to weigh in on the case of Kim Davis, the lady in Kentucky who refuses to issue a marriage licenses to a same sex couple. First: This is not a case of the government forcing anyone to violate their religious belief. She is free to quit her job. If she quits her job to honor God surely God would take care of her. Second: This is not a case of someone trying to uphold the sanctity of marriage. If she wanted to uphold the sanctity of marriage she should not have been married four different times. If she is worried about her name being affixed to a marriage license that goes against a biblical definition of marriage, she should not have her name on the last three marriage licenses given to her. Third: This seems to be a case of someone looking to cash in on the religious right. Churches all across the south will throw money at her to come and tell congregations how the evil American government put her in jail because of her faith in Jesus. This is why we are losing. This is why people have such disdain for evangelicals. Not because we disagree but because we dont take the bible seriously. If ever there was a case of he who is without sin cast the first stone, this is it. If ever there was a take the log out of your eye moment, this is it. We must stop looking to the government to make America a Christian utopia. Our kingdom is not of this world. We must abandon all thoughts of fixing others and let Jesus fix us. If we want sanctity of marriage then stop cheating, stop having affairs, stop looking at porn, stop getting divorces. That is the way for the church to stand up for the biblical definition of marriage, not by someone martyring their self-righteous self. Origins: On 3 September 2015, Facebook user Russell Williams published the above-quoted commentary pertaining to a then-current controversy involving Rowan County, Kentucky clerk Kim Davis to his personal Facebook page; early commenters requested permission to share his words, and the message was subsequently re-posted tens of thousands of times. commentary Kim Davis Williams spoke from the perspective of a pastor, a Baptist, and an self-identified Evangelical Christian in his remarks; he maintained a critical stance when it came to Davis' refusal to comply with the law, purportedly due to the strength of her religious conviction. Williams opined that the devout would be better served upholding the tenets of their faith individually rather than imposing those beliefs upon fellow Americans via legislation and force, and he lamented the disintegration of accord between Evangelicals and secular people due to the adverse impact of such controversies. Davis As to whether the writer accurately described himself, Williams is indeed a pastor with McCormick Road Baptist Church in Apopka, Florida. We contacted Williams via Facebook to ask about his popular message, but have not yet received a reply. pastor Last updated:  10 September 2015 Originally published: 10 September 2015",

        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  A man named Adrian Merced assaulted his girlfriend and may escape justice. MIXTURE Example:  [Collected via Facebook, October 2014] \nSo I am asking all of my friends especially those with ties to Haverhill to share this status.. My 18 year old daughter was beat nearly to death the other night by her boyfriend Adrian \"beast mode\" Merced who is 240lbs and 6'3. She confronted him about cheating in her home while she was at work as the sole provider supporting the household, and some of the females are allegedly as young as 16. He lifted her off of her feet slamming her head into the wall and then smashed her into a mirror. As her little 105lb body bled out and was in and out of consciousness he proceeded to drag her around the house smashing her head into doorframes and off the floor. As she begged for her life and told him he was gonna get a murder charge thinking she was gonna die, he continued kicking her in the head and stomach. She promised to say that she fell and he finally called 911. Doctors said the CAT scan indicated that the laceration came one cm' shy of severing her artery which would have killed her. At the start of the argument she attempted to call 911 but he took her phone. A judge ordered bail at 10,000$ and it looks as though mommy and daddy are gonna wipe his ass for him. In addition he has an open case out of MA on an ex girlfriend who he also severely beat. Let's make this public so he is shown no leniency when he goes to trial. It is unacceptable for a man to get away with repeatedly beating up girls and then lying about it. It's time for some real justice to be served and hopefully this will put the pressure on the court to set an example. \n Origins:  On 6 October 2014, a Facebook user posted the above-quoted text to the page for Massachusetts' Haverhill News along with photograph of someone identified as Adrian \"Beast Mode\" Merced. posted Haverhill News As of 8 October 2014, that post had been shared more than 24,000 times and garnered more than 7,000 likes, and the rapid virality of that offering led many to seek information on the man identified in the photo and the incident presented in the accompanying account. The Daily Sun newspaper of Laconia, New Hampshire, published an article on 7 October 2014 that seemingly corroborates at least some of the claims made in that text. According to that article, a 24-year-old by the name of Adrian Merced was arrested on 5 October 2014 and charged with one count of second degree assault, one count of simple assault, and one count of violation of a court order of protection: published \nAccording to police affidavits filed with the 4th Circuit Court, Laconia Division, police initially responded to the victim's apartment Saturday at 1:57 a.m. in answer to a 911 call. When they arrived they saw the victim had a cut on her head and Merced said she had accidentally fallen into a mirror. At this point the victim also told police she had fallen. She was taken to Lakes Region General Hospital for treatment. [Affidavits] said when police went to the hospital a few hours later to speak to her, she told them that she wanted an emergency order of protection regarding Merced, which was then granted by a circuit court judge. Merced was the hospital at that time and was served in hand at 4:30 a.m. At 4:19 p.m., police responded a second time to Union Avenue and the victim reported that Merced had sent her numerous text messages that began at 2 p.m. and ended at 3:44 p.m. The victim told the officer that Merced threw her to the ground, threw her into the mirror  breaking it  and her threw her to the ground. In his criminal complaints, Merced is described as being 6-feet 3-[inches] tall and weighing 240 pounds.  At the hospital the victim received 10 staples in her head and eight to 10 stitches in her backside.\n A mug shot of the Adrian Merced currently being held in Belknap County Jail in Laconia also matches that of the person pictured above, and a local police log reported the arrest of Merced for violating a protective order.  (The jail record and police log both record Merced's age as 26, not 24.) Merced was arraigned in Laconia on 6 October 2014 but has not yet been tried in connection with the alleged assault.  mug shot reported \n\n\n\n  Last updated:  9 October 2014\n",

        "justification": "In the final days before the November 2018 elections, social media users in Missouri began posting descriptions and photographs of a billboard that appeared to show President Donald Trump's face accompanied by an excerpt from a well-known Bible verse and a re-working of his 2016 presidential campaign slogan \"Make America Great Again\":   From a friend -- a billboard spotted outside of St Louis. I don't like using the word \"heresy,\" but I think I'll make an exception in this case. pic.twitter.com/FqaPnBXGHT pic.twitter.com/FqaPnBXGHT  Diana Butler Bass (@dianabutlerbass) November 4, 2018 November 4, 2018  The images prompted expressions of concern by some Christians that the billboard was associating or likening President Trump to Jesus Christ himself, the \"Word made flesh\" referenced in the Gospel quotation. In its proper context, Chapter 1, Verse 14 of the Gospel of John reads: reads He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me. And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. The billboard is real, and the photographs of it shared on social media in early November are authentic. The existence of the billboard was verified by St. Louis television station KMOV, which published their own photograph of it, describing the location as being \"on Interstate 170 near St. Charles Rock Road,\" which is around 15 miles north-west of downtown St. Louis, Missouri: KMOV \"Make the Gospel Great Again\": Large billboard of Trump has St. Louis Co. residents talking https://t.co/l0EDbpWhU2 #KMOV pic.twitter.com/FLIuXd47C9 https://t.co/l0EDbpWhU2 #KMOV pic.twitter.com/FLIuXd47C9  KMOV (@KMOV) November 5, 2018 November 5, 2018 \n This corroborates the description in Martha Baker's 3 November Facebook post, which stated that the billboard was located \"on I-170 (the Innerbelt in St. Louis) between the Rock Road and Page Blvd.\" Three days before Baker's post, another social media user posted their description of the billboard, expressing their dismay at what they called its \"idolatry\": This is not a drill. In #STL I just saw a billboard with Trump on it that says, The word made flesh. And Make the gospel great again. I cannot begin to express how livid I am at this level of idolatry. #STL  Rev. Momma (@TheRevMomma) October 31, 2018 October 31, 2018  The billboard is undoubtedly real, though it is not yet clear who paid for it and when it was erected. A spokesperson for DDI Media, the St. Louis company which owns the billboard itself, told us they could not share such information. On 5 November, a Facebook page called \"Make the Gospel Great Again\" (which is no longer available on the social networking web site) claimed responsibility for the billboard:  claimed ...We met as a team last night to discuss how much hatred weve received for our efforts to encourage fellow believers in holding fast to the faith. We prayed that the facebook page would be a community for fellow Christians to be encouraged at what God is doing in the world and to find out how they could, like our president, be a part of being Gods presence in making America great. But the hateful comments and mean spiritedness from liberals and atheists drowned out the voices of Christians in this country. These reflect the level of unfair deranged media attacks on the President in general and his supporters. Our billboard IS NOT equating Jesus with President Donald Trump. Salvation comes only from a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, not any man. But God does send his messengers to us, and just as King David liberated the faithful in his day, President Trump is doing this today through his protection of the unborn, defense of our land against foreign invaders and standing up for Israel... The page described its mission statement as follows: \"We believe God has given American Christians His earthly messenger - Donald J Trump. We follow his words in faith each day!\" statement As far back as 10 October, \"Make the Gospel Great Again\" posted an image which was almost identical to that ultimately displayed on the St. Louis billboard, and its profile photograph was the same logo which appeared on the billboard (a crucifix with an American flag): posted photograph   We sent a list of questions to an email address associated with the \"Make the Gospel Great Again\" Facebook page, in order to clarify who was behind it, and verify whether there was a link between it and the St. Louis billboard, but we did not receive any response.

            "A piece of racist propaganda was circulated in an attempt to smear the Black Lives Matter movement. "
        ],
        "justification": "In the spring of 2020, as protests against racial injustice and police brutality swept across the U.S. following the death of a Black man in police custody, online trolls started to spread racist propaganda in an attempt to smear the Black Lives Matter movement. Generally speaking, these posts made inflammatory and violent claims, then falsely attributed them to BLM. For example, one such hoax held that BLM protesters were going to \"assassinate white families.\"  hoax In June 2020, Snopes came across yet another flyer falsely attributed to Black Lives Matter that labeled white men, women, and children as \"the enemy\":   But this is not a genuine flyer issued or endorsed by Black Lives Matter. This is a piece of racist propaganda that was created in an apparent attempt to smear BLM and heighten racial tensions.  It isn't clear who created this fake poster. The earliest posting that we could find was from June 11, 2020, from a Twitter account devoted to QAnon, a wide-ranging and far-right conspiracy theory based almost entirely on anonymous social media posts that claim a deep state plot exists against President Donald Trump. From there, it was shared to the Russian site Aftershock.news; an All Lives Matter account; and an account adorned with British flags, where it received thousands of retweets. QAnon Aftershock.news All Lives Matter  account While we've found several accounts sharing this flyer along with messages denigrating Black Lives Matter, we've yet to see any accounts connected to the Black Lives Matter movement sharing this flyer in earnest.  In addition to the fact that this flyer originated with posters critical of BLM  and not with BLM accounts spreading this message in earnest  the statements on this flyer are also contrary to the positions of the Black Lives Matter movement. Nowhere on the Black Lives Matter website are white people identified as \"enemies,\" and the website is void of any calls to violence against white people.  BLM has also not called for \"re-education camps,\" for \"Black power\" to run the government, or for white people to stop dating outside their race. The official Black Lives Matter website has put out a list of \"demands,\" but that list has practically nothing in common with the viral hoax shown above. The official list from Black Lives Matter calls for an end to systematic racism and for the national defunding of police: Black Lives Matter We call for an end to the systemic racism that allows this culture of corruption to go unchecked and our lives to be taken. We call for a national defunding of police. We demand investment in our communities and the resources to ensure Black people not only survive, but thrive. If youre with us, add your name to the petition right now and help us spread the word. The \"demands\" on the hoax flyer did not originate with BLM. The items on this list are examples of what someone who is unfamiliar with the Black Lives Matter movement may fear are central tenets of this group. When a similar fake flyer was found in England, a local BLM activist told Scotland's Evening Telegraph: Evening Telegraph Joy Gansh, a local BLM activist, believes the display was created by people trying to discredit the movement. She said: Things like that, after what happened with the George Floyd mural being defaced, I think thats something that a white supremacist would put up to discredit us. Nobody that Ive seen advocating for the BLM movement would think that that is appropriate. My personal opinion is that this is people being framed. This is a way to make us seem in the wrong. The art student, who plans to organise a BLM march in Dundee soon, believes that white supremacists are using false posters to encourage violence. People that hold those kinds of beliefs arent part of this movement, she added. \"This seems like a way to stop us in our tracks and make us seem violent so they can come back with violence. We arent here for violence, were just here for justice and equality in all aspects of life.

        ],
        "justification": "In the days after Russia launched a deadly invasion on Ukraine, a photograph started circulating on social media that supposedly showed hundreds people on a crowded train station platform attempting to flee the country. The photograph was frequently shared with a caption stating: \"This is not a photo from 1941. This is a photo from March 2022.\"   This photograph was truly taken in early 2022 during Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  The caption accompanying the photograph appears to compare the current situation in Ukraine to the millions of people across Europe who were forced to flee Nazi aggression during World War II and the Holocaust. In the BBC's March 2022 coverage of Ukraine's modern-day refugees, they noted that the scene was reminiscent of what these people's grandparents experienced roughly 80 years ago: BBC's March 2022 coverage of Ukraine's modern-day refugees On the westbound platforms, the refugees huddle in crowded corridors and stairwells hoping to board trains that will take them to safety in Poland, Hungary or Slovakia. Among them are groups of Roma Gypsies who come from Kharkiv, where Russian shelling is killing civilians. Like everybody else they fled only with what they could carry, an assortment of holdalls and rucksacks. In Lviv, these scenes summon up the restive ghosts of Europe's past. The city is filled with people whose parents or grandparents experienced genocide and totalitarianism in the last century. Tens of thousands of Roma were murdered by the Nazis during World War Two. The above-displayed photograph was taken in Kharkiv, Ukraine, as millions of people were attempting to flee the country. Tim Mak, NPR's investigative correspondent in Ukraine, was one of the first to share the picture online. Mak said the news organization received the picture from an aide to the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNydj7j0mxQ\n\nHere's another report from NBC News: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsy4h_WYyo\n\nNBC News reported that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine following Russia's invasion. It's unclear how many passed through this specific train station.  The exact death toll in Ukraine is also hard to pin down. A U.S. official told CBS News on March 10, about two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, that thousands of Ukrainians civilians and soldiers had already been killed.  CBS News Thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers are also believed to have been killed over the past two weeks. The U.S. official said 2,000-4,000 Ukrainian troops have been killed. In the city of Mariupol  where an airstrike hit a maternity hospital on Wednesday  some 1,200 people have died over the course of Russia's nine-day siege of the city, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's office said, according to The Associated Press. A similar rumor was circulated online about Ukraine's Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater. That rumor featured two photographs, one taken recently in 2022 and another taken during World War II: https://twitter.com/kyivpost/status/1500751560166588416?s=21\n\nThese photographs are both real and taken during the referenced times.

        ],
        "justification": "On 14 June 2015, a number of Florida news outlets published a seemingly remarkable photograph, sent to them by a man named Richard Jones, showing a raccoon riding the back of an alligator like a surfboard: published  The peculiar sight may have been endearing, but it also left many viewers questioning the image's authenticity. Photographer Richard Jones's explanation of how he snapped the image was that he was walking with his son along the Oaklawaha River in the Ocala National Forest when they came across a raccoon. Their appearance startled the creature, he said, which sought the safety of the water, where it hopped onto the back of an alligator. The raccoon was only \"riding\" the alligator for a short while, Jones said, as the gator quickly slipped underwater and the raccoon scurried back onto land:  Had a wonderful morning with the family in Ocala National forest and took an equally wonderful photo! We were walking along the Oaklawaha river watching some gators warm up in the morning. My son went through some palm fronds to catch a different angle and frightened a raccoon. It must have been asleep because it stumbled toward the water and hoped on top of the gator we were watching. I snapped a lucky picture right when the gator slipped into the water and before the raccoon jumped off and scurried away. Without the context you'd think the raccoon was hitching a ride across the river. Pretty amazing. Definitely the photo of a lifetime. Included a second one my wife took or the area. You have my permission to share the photo and use the photo in any way. I don't want anything in return. Just thought other people might enjoy it. However, not everyone took the photograph at face value. The Florida Times-Union published it but included a disclaimer stating that they hadn't confirmed its authenticity:   published The photo of the gator with raccoon in tow seems to have gone viral on social media, and the story has been picked up by several other media outlets. And although we haven't been able to confirm the authenticity of these images, this was too good of a story to leave our viewers out of the loop. DISCLAIMER: Mr. Jones did not leave a phone number in his email so that we could confirm the authenticity of the image. We did try to contact him via his email address and we also requested he phone us. At the time this story was posted, we still have not received a call or email from Mr. Jones.   The Ocala Star Banner was more skeptical, opting not to publish the photograph due to questions about its authenticity and a lack of response from the submitter:\nUntil now, the Star-Banner has declined to publish the photo because we still have questions about its authenticity. We have reached out to the photographer, a man named Rich Jones, but [have] not heard back from him. Heres a summary of our concerns: +Scope: The raccoon seems out of proportion -- too big -- compared with the alligator. +Feet: Even zooming in, you cant tell whether the raccoon has feet. +Tail: Dont raccoons usually have longer, fluffier tails? +Posture: That is an unusual pose for a raccoon. It almost looks like a taxidermy piece. +Gator: The alligators eye has an odd color, shape and placement. Its body seems rubber-like. +Mask: The raccoons mask seems like an add-on. When a photographer in London captured a somewhat comparable image of an animal \"riding\" another animal in February 2015  a rather amazing picture of a weasel hitchhiking on the back of a woodpecker in flight  a small army of photoshop experts also declared that picture to be fake for similar reasons. But in that case the photographer made himself available for interviews, and the consensus remains that that photograph was real. captured consensus While Jones didn't come forward with more information about the image, a performance artist who goes by the name \"Zardulu\" did. In December 2016, Zardulu told the Washington Post that she was responsible for a number of social media hoaxes, including this photograph of the raccoon riding an alligator: Washington Post In 2015, there was an incredible viral photograph, a lucky shot, that showed a raccoon perched on the back of a swimming alligator. A man named Richard Jones told the local news that hed snapped the picture himself, and a lot of Florida news outlets ran with it. The story spread to larger publications. It went viral. There were plenty of doubters, of course. But also many believers, people who would prefer to live in a world where a raccoon could use a predator as a ferry. And that preference is exactly what Zardulu understands so well. I staged the raccoon and the alligator, Zardulu said. The animals are taxidermied; she sprayed each with a commercial product used to waterproof leather to protect them from the water. Zardulu showed us photographs of the setup, and some of herself, in costume, clutching the animals:   Weber, Greta.  \"Raccoon Rides Alligator in Florida  Is It for Real?\"\r\n  National Geographic.  16 June 2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n Ohlheiser, Abby.  \"She Staged a Viral Story.

It has not been released to the general public, but it's something we all need to be aware of. A couple of weeks ago someone was seen taking photos of my ambulance company in Bay Shore. This same person was seen outside Exchange Ambulance in Islip doing the same. The police were notified and the person was apprehended outside Southside hospital, again taking photos. He is a man of Middle Eastern descent and is being held for investigation. It seems that he was gathering information about our response capabilities in a mass casualty attack. The NY Field Office of the FBI held a meeting at Bay Shore Fire Department for officials from the local PD, EMS and FD's. They have information from this man and from their own intelligence that a mass attack is planned for Long Island. On Black Friday (November 26) 4 Long Island Malls are supposed to be hit simultaneously with chemical weapons. This would be the first time a chemical weapon is used in the United States. Forces from NYC and Washington DC would be diverted to aid here on Long Island leaving these areas vulnerable. A second attack would take place in these areas. Ever since 9/11 EMS has undergone extensive training on how\nto deal with a terrorist attack and to think it could really happen here is terrifying. There is also concern about car bombings as a large number of vehicles have gone missing in Nassau and Suffolk counties. Ambulances, taxi's, commercial vans and airport limos have been reported stolen.  These vehicles look perfectly innocent driving through our neighborhoods and no one would think twice about seeing them. This is not an internet scam. The officers at my department were at this meeting and I saw the minutes myself. I figure it's pretty serious if the FBI made an appearance to share what they know. I'm not sure why this isn't being released to the public. I can only assume that if this got out, no one would shop and it would be devastating to our economy. I do not want to spread panic, only information. Take from this what you will, but I needed to let you all know. I love you all and I felt I needed to share this with you. I know it's hard to believe. I can't believe that an Al Qaeda operative was only a few blocks from my home.\n Origins:  We first happened across this e-mail in mid-October 2004. At this time, the identity of its author is not known to us, nor is that of whomever penned the following preface that appears on a number of the forwards: \n\nThe following email was sent to me last night by a personal friend.  She is the directly involved with the ambulance corp.  I am sending this email to the Red Cross to inquire.  Nonetheless, please read it and try and shop around Nov. 26, not THE 26th. Her email is not a \"forward to 10 people\" It is personally written and personally sent to her friends based on facts she is personally aware of.\n\n We searched for news articles that made reference to a man of Middle Eastern appearance being detained under the circumstances described, but to no avail. We also did not hear scuttlebutt about a potential terrorist assault on Long Island set for 26 November 2004 from sources other than just the one e-mail, which is noteworthy, given that supposedly at a meeting at the Bay Shore Fire Department on Long Island the FBI informed any number of police, fire, and emergency personnel of it. (It was not really plausible that everyone in the room, with the exception of one letter-writer, would have stayed entirely mute about an upcoming chemical attack on their neighborhoods, preferring to keep a secret over potentially safeguarding themselves and their loved ones by making the risk known.) Common knowledge has it that Black Friday (the term for the day after American Thanksgiving) is biggest shopping day of the year. (Which is somewhat true  though as far as actual sales go, it lags behind the four days that make up the two weekends just prior to Christmas, in terms of number of shoppers loosed on the stores it might well be.) It therefore follows that mall-targeting terrorists looking to cause the greatest harm to the greatest number would select that day over any number of  biggest shopping day others. Doug Einsfeld, chief of Exchange Ambulance of the Islips, said the e-mailed warning was a hoax. About two months prior to the rumor's emergence, the volunteer ambulance corps and local law enforcement had conducted a terror drill based on a scenario involving a chemical attack at Long Island malls taking place on the day after Thanksgiving. Einsfeld concludes that printed information about the drill, circulated internally and to police and fire officials, must have been used as a basis for the alert. He confirms that a man was seen taking pictures outside the volunteer ambulance corps' building.\nThe FBI was notified and did investigate, but no evidence of the man intending any harm was uncovered. Regarding the e-mail's claim of the errant shutter bug's being taken into custody, Suffolk Police Third Squad Det. Sgt. Thomas Groneman said no such arrest was made. As for the claim of the man being of Middle Eastern appearance, Einsfeld said he saw the man only from behind and couldn't tell his ethnicity. This was not the first time it had been whispered that terrorists were plotting to kill shoppers. In October 2001, a fiction about the revelation of a planned strike in malls on Halloween by one of those involved in a letter to his girlfriend swept the nation. There was nothing to that story, but it nevertheless kept people away from the stores that day. letter to his girlfriend Adding to the plausibility of the Long Island tale were reports from the summer of unusual interest in that area's emergency vehicles. On 12 August 2004, the New York State Association of Fire Chiefs circulated this memo: \n\nTHE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS FORWARDED BY THE NEW YORK STATE ASSOCIATION OF FIRE CHIEFS PUBLIC RELATIONS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR INFORMATION.\nAugust 12, 2004 The following alert was released by Westchester County Department of Emergency Services based on information fron New Jersey authorities and should be practiced by all agencies. Within the past week, the Office of Counter-Terrorism received three reports of suspicious activity concerning ambulances. The most recent incident involved an individual who attended an open-house at an ambulance squad in Middlesex County. The man, who claimed he was from Pakistan and a physician, asked a series of questions to the squad members that related exclusively to the operation of the emergency vehicles, including the speed at which the vehicles responded to calls and the use of the lights and sirens.  The individual appeared very nervous, did not ask about patient care, and left the premises when asked to complete a membership application. The second incident occurred at a hospital in Essex County and involved an inquiry made by a male of Middle-Eastern appearance who was first observed standing near an ambulance at the emergency room doors while writing notes in a small notepad.  When confronted by the vehicle's operator, a firefighter/EMT, the man asserted that he was employed as an ambulance mechanic. He then asked where a nearby fire department serviced its vehicles.  The man provided an illegible New York driver's license when asked to produce identification before leaving the premises. Lastly, OCT received information concerning an unusual attempt by three men of Middle-Eastern appearance to join a volunteer ambulance squad. The men expressed to squad members an \"abnormal interest\" in operating the emergency vehicles, and further insisted that the process by which they obtain the appropriate credentials and certifications to join the squad be expedited at their personal expense. Due to the recent threat elevation to ORANGE (HIGH) for the financial sector and intelligence relating to the threat of Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs), any suspicious activity relating to emergency vehicles is of particular concern and should be reported to law enforcement immediately. As demonstrated by recent attacks in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and elsewhere, terrorist operatives worldwide continue to rely on VBIEDs as a method of attack.  This tactic has been used here in the past, notably in the 1993 World Trade Center and 1995 Oklahoma City bombings.  The World Trade Center and Oklahoma City attacks were carried out with rented vehicles, highlighting the need for awareness among the car, truck, and  limousine rental community of the potential for vehicle-borne attacks in the United States. As always, report all suspicious activities and individuals to the toll-free terrorism tip-lines.\nNew York State: 1-866-SAFE-NYS\nNew York City: 1-888-NYC-SAFE\n It was feared in the summer of 2004 that those mysterious men might have been weighing up the possibilities of fashioning ambulances or firetrucks into rolling bombs by loading them with explosives or chemicals and using them to breach security barriers at hard-to-reach targets, the underlying assumption being emergency vehicles would be allowed near or into locations ordinary cars and trucks would be turned away from. Also considered was the possibility of such vehicles being used to launch a second wave of attack on the heels of an initial terror strike when all was confusion and no one would think to try to prevent an ambulance or fire truck from going to the aid of the injured. Long Island, which lies off New York City, is 118 miles long and 20 miles across at its widest point, and is connected to the Big Apple by three expressways.  It is home to a population of 2.65 million. Regarding the entities mentioned in the warning e-mail, the Exchange Ambulance of the Islip's is a volunteer non-profit service consisting of approximately 100 members. It is located on Long Island and serves the towns of East Islip, Islip, Islip Terrace. Southside Hospital  is Long Island's largest community hospital, having 377 beds. Exchange Ambulance Southside Hospital The region believes itself adequately prepared for a terrorist attack, including an event in Manhattan that could immobilize the area and cut off the Island from the mainland for days or perhaps weeks. Emergency workers on the island have engaged in a number of simulation drills for disaster events including train derailments with mass casualties, detonations of dirty bombs containing chemical, biological, or radioactive agents, hostage takings, and evacuations of specified areas. As Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy said in August 2004, \"We are cognizant that we are in close proximity to the No. 1 target in America.\" Which could well be what triggered this rumor  that sense of proximity could have worked to cause someone to jump at shadows, misremembering an alert from the summer about suspicious characters as a current matter (especially in light of another man being seen taking photographs) and misunderstanding the paperwork generated around a summer 2004 disaster preparation drill as minutes of a meeting in which a specific warning was issued.

            "Are child predators using Facebook to source victims by adding unsuspecting parents as friends?"
        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  Predators, pedophiles, and child trafficking rings are using Facebook to source new victims by friending trusting parents and mining images posted of their children. Example:  [Collected on Facebook, September 2014] A guy sends you a friend request. You don't know him, but he's got a cute profile pic, so you accept. It's baby girl's first day of school! She looks SO cute in her new outfit you just have to take a picture and put it on Facebook so all your friends and family can see. You're so excited dropping her off that you \"check in\" to her school on Fb saying \"I can't believe how big she's gotten. Time sure flies. One proud momma/daddy right here!\"... Meanwhile, the mystery guy whose friend request you hurriedly accepted earlier this morning is saving that picture you posted of your daughter in her cute new outfit to his phone and texting it to 60 other grown men across the world with the caption \"Caucasian female. Age 5. Brown hair, green eyes. $2,500.\" Not only did you provide a picture of your little girl to a child trafficker, you've handed him the name and exact location of her school on a silver cyber platter. You go to pick her up at 3:00 this afternoon, but she's nowhere to be found. Little do you know, your precious baby girl was sold to a 43-year-old pedophile before you even stepped foot off campus this morning, and now she's on her way to South Africa with a bag over her head, confused, terrified and crying because a man she's never seen before picked her up from school, and now she doesn't know where her parents are, where she's going, or what's gonna happen to her. STOP ADDING STRANGERS ON FACEBOOK. Origins:  In September 2014, the post above (without original attribution) went viral on Facebook. While this iteration is a new one, panic over internet strangers is as old as the internet itself, and warnings such as this have largely morphed from email forwards to Facebook shares. panic over internet strangers In May and June of 2015, the story received a second wave of interest after it was published to the website StylishLisa on 27 May 2015. On 30 May 2015 the message appeared on the Facebook page Lil' Red Warriors, but was later deleted after Facebook commenters correctly identified the photograph's origin on a page about children's hairstyles. The photo and its claim were later published verbatim to the Facebook page of Cyn Malvita, from where it was shared hundreds of thousands of times. A cached version of the iteration involving the hairstyling picture is embedded below: published Lil' Red Warriors deleted children's hairstyles Cyn Malvita  The Facebook post currently in circulation bears some resemblance to a well-traveled warning from years back describing a similar danger. While the premise is similar, the stated risk has evolved, incorporating Facebook's open and share-friendly nature as the door through which rampant child predators will enter your life and summarily terrorize you. well-traveled warning This particular warning has some unpleasant undertones in its telling, suggesting that female users are too readily tempted by a \"cute\" potential predator to consider the safety of their children. It also tacitly condemns parents (mothers, presumably in particular) for even mentioning their children in hawking its highly improbable, sanctimonious premise. Facebook and similar social media sites have ushered in a new level of panic when it comes to internet safety, given that the social network requires users to supply accurate information about their true identities and real names to use the service. While many users flout this aspect of the site's terms and services, many others have been banned temporarily or permanently for using aliases in place of real names. Reading the circulating post above might lead one to believe that the danger is very real and omnipresent, but the scenario presented is one that is exceedingly unlikely. Among other implausibilities, this warning makes it sound as though the bad guys are stymied in their search for victims and don't know where to look for kids to abduct until they see pictures of them on Facebook. But potential abductors' seeing a Facebook photo of a particular child who attends a given school does nothing to facilitate the snatching of random children for sale to pedophiles  would-be kidnappers don't need Facebook photos, as they could simply lie in wait outside just about any school and try to grab children as such opportunities presented themselves. Aside from that, first and foremost, most schools nowadays do not release children to parties who have not been explicitly granted permission and had their names recorded on an authorized list, a fact to which any parent who has ever needed a friend to make a last-minute school pickup can attest. Secondly, while the risk of child abduction and trafficking may exist, children are far, far more likely to be endangered by a relative or other \"trusted\" adult than a random Facebook contact. According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, the most recent statistics reflect a far different danger than the one described above. Of 800,000 children reported missing, 200,000 were abducted by relatives, 58,000 were kids taken by nonfamily members, and only 115 missing child reports were considered \"stereotypical\" abductions involving a complete stranger with intent to harm or keep the child. National Center for Missing & Exploited Children A lengthy report on Child Exploitation Prevention presented to Congress by the Justice Department in 2010 [PDF] further delves into the profiles of predators involved in child abuse and trafficking. According to the data presented, the vast majority of children harmed in this manner are either introduced or otherwise victimized by family members or other trusted adults such as babysitters, coaches, or family friends. Only four percent of victims identified were exploited or abused by an adult not previously known to the child or their family. PDF In the cases examined, abuse typically occurred over the course of years and involved \"grooming\" and other behaviors designed to created compliance. Child victims were not at risk of being immediately whisked to Africa by a strange Facebook user, but rather more likely placed in harm's way by the people meant to ensure their safety and care. On rare occasions child predators may mine publicly posted photos of children for personal use or trade, and posted Facebook pictures and locations might facilitate a kidnapping if the abductors were seeking to grab a specific child (rather than trolling for random victims), but no evidence suggests the posting of kids' photos on Facebook has resulted in a general increase of kidnapping or abuse of children.

Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Irans atom bomb program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to justify destroying Syria in the name of Israel. She specifically links Irans mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Irans atom bomb program threatens Israels monopoly on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.   A nearly identical claim (since deleted) was published by a separate site in March 2016.

I wanted to pass on something I intend to publish on Syria and Iran, because I think it is worth trying to urge the President and his political advisers to act. As you can see from today's column by Jackson Diehl, the pundits and many in the media will push the Syria issue very hard for the foreseeable future. It may not be on the front burner every day, but it will be close to or at the top of the media's attention indefinitely. Interestingly, the Republicans have showed their hand on the foreign policy debate, in which inaction on Syria is pretty much the only serious criticism they can offer that will stick. As you will see from the attached piece, I believe that action on Syria will forestall the biggest danger on the horizon, that Israel launches a surprise attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Although the pressure has now eased for a variety of reasons, it will return. Action by Washington on Syria, on the other hand, I believe will eliminate much of the urgency for Israeli action. In other words, a more aggressive policy on Syria will eliminate the best case the republican's have going into the November election, will ease substantially the pressure on Israel to attack Iran and possibly spark a wider war in the Middle East, and finally would be the right stance on Syria going forward. I know you may not agree but I thought it was better to share this with you first as at least a new way to look at the problem. All best, your friend,\nJamie James P.

        "justification": "Claim:  Photographs show a deer atop a communications pole. \nStatus:  True.\n Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2003] \n\n\nSubject: Service Call Of The Month Read the article first! Then look at the pictures. It wont make sense to you and you knowledge about hunting if you don't! Service call of the month from a Baltimore Gas & Electric residential customer. BGE received a call from a customer saying: My power is out. When you come to fix it be sure to bring a truck with a tall enough bucket to remove the deer\". The customer service rep prudently trying to gather helpful information to help diagnose the problem asked, \"What deer\"? The customer replied \" There is a deer on top of one of the electric poles on Wilkes Rd about 1/2 mile west of Perimeter Rd\".  The customer service rep tried desperately to pull herself together and not laugh in front of the customer and replied, \"We will dispatch someone right away to investigate the power outage. Thank you for the call\". Upon completion of the call, the customer service rep proceeded to share the funny story with her coworkers in the office and they all had a good laugh. Well, low and behold, the serviceman who repaired the problem stopped by the customer service office the following day with the attached pictures. Sure enough, the poor deer had been hit by a train & landed on top of distribution feeder pole!   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Origins:   This is yet another case where someone's humorous commentary has been slapped on top of photographs from another source, but in this case the text isn't too far off the mark.  The original caption accompanying these pictures correctly reflects the fact that these photographs were taken around Winnipeg, not Baltimore: \n\nThis happened just outside of Winnepeg. Ft. Gary had a call this morning (Saturday) that there was a deer on a\npole . . . right! Sure enough there was. This is right beside the tracks a few miles west\nof Headingly Station. They figure that a train hit it and launched it up there.\n\n These photographs are \"real\" in the sense that they are indeed pictures taken in early January 2003 of a deer found atop a 25-foot-high communications pole in Headingley, a town just northwest of (and formerly a part of)  Winnipeg, Manitoba.   Plenty of people in the area saw the deer atop the pole (including the Manitoba Hydro workers who eventually removed it), and the story was covered by local CBC radio and TV outlets.  Headingley The issue of whether the deer was really launched atop the pole when it was struck by a train is less certain.  The Canadian National Railways (CNR) maintained they received no report from any of their engineers about a train's hitting a deer in the Headingley area, and whether a deer's torso could have been struck with enough force to launch it 25 feet up in the air yet remain mostly undamaged (save for missing portions of its back legs) has been the subject of much debate.   The general consensus was that the feat was rather improbable but technically possible, but some people speculated that the deer was indeed hit and killed by a passing train, but it was then somehow deliberately set atop the pole by local pranksters.  Still others opined that the animal was lying atop lowered wires and then hoist in the air when those wires were pulled into place.     Oddly enough, a similar mystery had been reported just a few months earlier, when a six-month-old deer was found hanging in the 12-foot-high crotch of a maple tree in Delaware county, New York.   mystery Additional information: \n    CBC radio interview  Last updated:   8 March 2003  \n",

Her disinterest in the show \"Fixer Upper\" with her hilarious husband Chip Gaines has fallen to the wayside due to her side business. Here we reveal the truth behind what this side business is really all about... The star of HGTVs hit TV show, Joanna Gaines, has shocked us all and 2017 has only just started. In recent developments, the reality star revealed that she just started a side beauty business because she is a serial entrepreneur and it's just in her nature. She never expected it to grow as fast as it did. HGTV and the network as a whole was not happy when they found out about this (to say the least) and they made Joanna decide on which direction she was going to go. Being so turned off by the reaction of HGTV and their \"power move\" she decided to pursue her new skin care line.   The article went on to promote VLamorous, a purported \"anti-aging serum.\"  Another version of the scam hawks a product allegedly created by Gaines called Bella Serata Anti-Aging Serum (the text is otherwise identical). version The ads prompted a spate of rumors that Gaines is abandoning the popular TV show and questions from concerned viewers.

        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  12-year-old CJ Pearson was suspended from Facebook because he criticized President Obama. FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, March 2015] \n would like to know if the information circulating about CJ\nPearson being suspended from Facebook, due to hid support of Giuliani's\ncomment about President Obama is true. Here is the link provided with the\nFacebook story: \"After This Bright Kid Attacked Barack Obama, Facebook did THIS to Him\" \n Origins:  On 21 February 2015, Georgia middle school student CJ Pearson became an internet sensation after he published a video criticizing President Obama. The clip addressed controversial remarks made by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani speculating whether the President truly loved America. Pearson's video was viewed more than a million times and earned him significant acclaim, particularly among conservative viewers who agreed with his remarks. Pearson was impassioned, articulate, and politically precocious as he excoriated the President over several (mostly interlinked) issues, including the advancement of the Islamic State (ISIS) and the deaths of American journalists at the hands of its militants: \n\nIf you really did love America, you would call [Islamic State] what it really is: an assault on Christianity, an assault on America and downright hate for the American values that our country holds ... freedom of speech, freedom of religion and everything that our country stands for ... I hope that one day people will get enough guts to speak out against your downright hatred for this nation.\n\n Soon after Pearson's video began to circulate online, the boy was locked out of his Facebook account. According to a rumor published on several blogs and Fox News Insider, Pearson was \"censored\" because of his video: blogs \n\nBut after all those views, what did Facebook do? They locked Pearson's account for \"suspicious activity.\" Outrageous! It is obvious that someone inside Facebook wanted to stop this video from growing its viral status, and is a clear case of censorship. CJ Pearson has a bright future ahead of himself, and I'm glad Fox News promoted his story.\n The claim was compelling but ultimately didn't wash: Pearson's video achieved more than a million views on YouTube. Suspending his Facebook account did not prohibit or discourage others from continuing to share the video on other platforms. As to whether \"someone at Facebook\" was afraid of Pearson's biting critique: there were and are far more invective-filled political pages, about President Obama and other topics, on Facebook, that haven't been subject to \"censorship\" or similarly sanctioned by Facebook, so clearly political outrage remains permissible on that social network so long as it falls within the social network's rules and regulations. Facebook itself provided the answer to why CJ Pearson's account was suspended: at 12 years old, the boy had falsified his age in his Facebook profile and did not meet Facebook's terms and conditions which require all users to be 13 or older. Once Pearson drew attention to himself (and his real age), it was clear his account was in violation of Facebook's stated rules and was therefore suspended. conditions Shortly afterwards CJ Pearson's Facebook page was restored, but instead of being the personal page of an underage boy, it was reclassified as a Public Figure page.  Presumably this could not have been done without Facebook's cooperation and was undertaken to get around the age restriction that prompted the page's original removal. On 23 September 2015, the now 13-year-old Pearson claimed (via Twitter) that he had been blocked from following President Obama's Twitter account (@POTUS):  A few hours later, Assistant Press Secretary Frank Benenati tweeted a denial of Pearson's claim, asserting that neither Pearson nor anyone else had ever been blocked from following the @POTUS account:  Pearson naturally took umbrage at the suggestion that he was being dishonest:  Other analyses of the claim made by Pearson suggest that he posted a digitally fabricated image and was not actually blocked from following the @POTUS account on Twitter. analyses \n\n\n\n   Last updated:  24 September 2015\n",

            "Social media posts mischaracterized how the American Rescue Plan will affect users of cash apps like Venmo."
        ],
        "justification": "Various social media posts circulating in late December 2021 claimed that thanks to coronavirus stimulus legislation known as the American Rescue Plan, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration and Democratic legislators would begin \"spying\" or \"snooping\" on users of cash apps like PayPal and Venmo. Here is an example of one such post: example   The truth is, unsurprisingly, more nuanced, but the bottom line is that, contrary to what the above Twitter posts state, the effect of the legislation in question isn't that the Biden administration or Democrats will be \"tapping into\" or \"spying on\" bank or cash app accounts. This is a misleading characterization. What the legislation does is significantly lower the threshold for reporting taxable transactions made using cash apps like Venmo, PayPal, or Zelle for goods and services to the IRS. And when you reach that threshold, the app companies will then be required to send a tax form called a 1099-K to both you and the IRS. A 1099-K is, according to PayPal, an \"informational tax form that is used to report goods and services payments received by a business or individual in the calendar year.\" PayPal As of this writing, the current threshold for such reporting is $20,000 and 200 payments in goods and services. Come Jan. 1, 2022, that reporting threshold will drop down to $600. threshold This could have a significant impact on platform users' tax returns. Here's how Bloomberg Tax described how users might experience the change: Bloomberg Tax For example, a model train collector may have paid $5,000 for model train pieces over several years that they now sell for $8,000, and the marketplace that introduced the seller to the buyer and through which the sale took place may charge the seller a total fee of $800. It may cost the model train seller $200 in postage to send the pieces to its buyers. The Form 1099-K that the seller will receive from the TPSO will report $8,000 in gross proceeds paid. However, the sellers taxable gain from that sale would only be $2,000. As a result, collectors and other online sellers will need to keep extensive records of their expenses going forward to avoid over-reporting of income and overpayment of tax. Also, consider the alternativea teenager who walks dogs to earn extra money. If their income in 2022 exceeds $600, their expenses may be limited to the fees charged by the website that connects them to pet owners, but they will owe income taxand possibly self-employment taxon the income they earn. According to PayPal, which owns Venmo, the change doesn't affect people who use the apps for personal transactions, like paying a friend back for your share of dinner, gifts, or chipping in for trips. PayPal also states that its app allows users to categorize their own transactions as personal versus rendering payment for \"goods and services.\" PayPal Business Users on Cash Apps Will Begin Receiving Tax Forms.

We have something we would like to share. First off, it feels odd that we have to share this kind of thing with everyone, but it's a consequence of the lives we've chosen to lead, which we also happen to be deeply grateful for. We're living in an incredible moment in time, but it's also a time where truth can easily get distorted into \"alternative facts\" ;) So we want to share the truth so you know that if you didn't read it here then it's most certainly fiction. We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together. Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now. There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision -- just two best friends realizing it's time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible. We are still a family and will always be loving, dedicated parents to Everly. We won't be commenting beyond this, and we thank you all in advance for respecting our family's privacy.

        "justification": "Claim:  Transcript reproduces 2007 commencement address delivered by Yogi Berra at Saint Louis University. \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, June 2007] \n\n\nThank you again for joining us at the game last night.  Hopefully you had as much fun as we did!  As I mentioned yesterday, Yogi gave the commencement address at St. Louis University this year.  Printed below is a transcript of that address.  Enjoy!  \"Thank you all for being here tonight. I know this is a busy time of year, and if you weren't here, you could probably be somewhere else. I especially want to thank the administration at St. Louis University for making this day necessary. It is an honor to receive this honorary degree.  \"It is wonderful to be here in St. Louis and to visit the old neighborhood. I haven't been back since the last time I was here. Everything looks the same, only different. Of course, things in the past are never as they used to be. \"Before I speak, I have something I'd like to say. As you may know, I never went to college, or high school for that matter. To be honest, I'm not much of a public speaker, so I will try to keep this short as long as I can. \"As I look out upon all of the young people here tonight, there are a number of words of wisdom I might depart. But I think the most irrelevant piece of advice I can pass along is this:  \"The most important things in life are the things that are least important. \"I could have gone a number of directions in my life. Growing up on the Hill, I could have opened a restaurant or a bakery. But the more time I spent in places like that, the less time I wanted to spend there. I knew that if I wanted to play baseball, I was going to have to play baseball. My childhood friend, Joe Garagiola, also became a big-league ballpayer, as did my son, Dale. I think you'll find the similarities in our careers are quite different.  \"You're probably wondering, how does a kid from the Hill become a New York Yankee and get in the Hall of Fame? Well, let me tell you something, if it was easy nobody would do it. Nothing is impossible until you make it possible. \"Of course, times were different. To be honest, I was born at an early age. Things are much more confiscated now. It seems like a nickel ain't worth a dime anymore. But let me tell you, if the world was perfect, it wouldn't be. Even Napoleon had his Watergate.  \"You'll make some wrong mistakes along the way, but only the wrong survive. Never put off until tomorrow what you can't do today. Denial isn't just a river in Europe. \"Strive for success and remember you won't get what you want unless you want what you get. Some will choose a different path. If they don't want to come along, you can't stop them. Remember, none are so kind as those who will not see.  \"Keep the faith and follow the Commandments: Do not covet thy neighbor's wife, unless she has nothing else to wear. Treat others before you treat yourself. As Franklin Eleanor Roosevelt once said, 'The only thing you have to fear is beer itself.' \"Hold on to your integrity, ladies and gentlemen. It's the one thing you really need to have; if you don't have it, that's why you need it. Work hard to reach your goals, and if you can't reach them, use a ladder. There may come a day when you get hurt and have to miss work. Don't worry, it won't hurt to miss work.  \"Over the years, I have realized that baseball is really just a menopause for life. We all have limitations, but we also know limitation is the greatest form of flattery. Beauty is in the eyes of Jim Holder. \"Half the lies you hear won't be true, and half the things you say, you won't ever say. \"As parents you'll want to give your children all the things you didn't have. But don't buy them an encyclopedia, make them walk to school like you did. Teach them to have respect for others, especially the police. They are not here to create disorder, they are here to preserve it.  \"Throughout my career, I found good things always came in pairs of three. There will be times when you are an overwhelming underdog. Give 100 percent to everything you do, and when that's not enough, give everything you have left. 'Winning isn't everything, but it's better than rheumatism.' I think Guy Lombardo said that. \"Finally, dear graduates and friends, cherish this moment; it is a memory you will never forget. You have your entire future ahead of you.  \"Good luck and Bob's speed.\"\n Origins:  Lawrence Peter \"Yogi\" Berra is best known in the  sports world for his Hall of Fame career as a catcher with baseball's New York Yankees from 1947-63, and in the pop culture world for his many \"Yogi-isms\"  legendary, often self-contradictory quips that may leave listeners shaking their heads in befuddlement but still somehow get the point across (e.g., \"It's like dj vu all over again\"; \"When you come to a fork in the road, take it.\").  Even those persons completely unfamiliar with Yogi's baseball career have probably seen him delivering a string of Yogi-isms in the classic \"Berra at the Barber\" television commercial for Aflac insurance. commercial Berra, a native of St. Louis, was invited to attend 19 May 2007 graduation ceremonies at Saint Louis University (SLU) to receive an honorary degree and serve as commencement speaker. Yogi didn't disappoint his SLU audience, receiving a standing ovation from the enthusiastic crowd and delivering a speech peppered with familiar Yogi-isms: invited speech \n\nBaseball's unofficial ambassador started things off on a light note by talking about what it felt like to be back home in St. Louis (\"Feels like deja vu all over again!\") and about whether he'd had a chance to visit The Hill, the St. Louis neighborhood where he was born. (\"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\")  Then Berra revealed the wisdom behind many of his most famous \"Yogi-isms,\" the classic quotes and quips that propelled him to pop culture status and made him one of the most quoted sports figures in history.  \"Dear graduates, when you come to a fork in the road, take it,\" Berra said. \"In life, the only poor decisions are the ones you don't follow through on. When you leave here today you will have more choices than you ever thought possible. But when you have to make a choice, make it because you believe in it. Then stick to your guns.\" Then he addressed one of the quotes that people most often ask him about: \"If the world was perfect, it wouldn't be.\" \"People always tell me that quote I said doesn't make much sense. But all of you understand what I'm saying, right?\" he asked the estimated 10,000 graduates, family members and friends in the crowd. \"I know you got a good education at SLU. And I'm sure it's opened your eyes to the people in the world who need your help. But most important, your SLU education has prepared you to give that help.\" \"Be careful if you don't know where you're going in life, because you might not get there,\" he said, quoting another classic Yogi-ism.\n However, the much-circulated text reproduced at the head of this article  a non-stop assortment of Yogi-isms, Yogi-like statements, and malapropisms  is not a transcript of Yogi Berra's SLU commencement address.  It's the invention of St. Louis Post-Dispatch version \n\nDeadlines being what they are for this Sunday column, this essayist missed a momentous occasion recently. Yogi Berra accepted an honorary degree from St. Louis University and delivered the commencement speech for 1,900 graduates and 10,000 in attendance at Scottrade Center. It's hard to imagine a more promising lingual event. Berra is to vocal communication what Don Cherry is to the fashion industry. Yogi doesn't so much command the English language as he corkscrews it. It is part of what makes the baseball Hall of Famer and pride of the Hill one of America's endearing figures.  While the oratory went unrecognized in this space last week, I was fortunate enough to secure  wink, wink  a copy of the discourse and felt compelled to share it with those who did not attend. So here is, in its entirety, Yogi's dissertation.\n Last updated:  21 June 2007\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   Berry, Clayton.  \"Yogi Berra to Share Words of Wisdom with Saint Louis University Graduates.\"    Berry, Clayton.  \"'Live Your Life Like Every Day is Opening Day.'\"    O'Neill, Dan.  \"Yogi's Speech Ain't Over Till It's Over Your Head.\"",

        ],
        "justification": "On May 18, 2023, a Twitter user shared a photograph of the late physicist Stephen Hawking sitting with a group of people in what appeared to be a tropical setting. The user claimed that Hawking was on the Caribbean island owned by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  In a tweet, @dom_lucre asked, \"Serious question, why the hell was Stephen Hawking on Jeffrey Epstein's Island?\" asked  (@@dom_lucre/X)  This is a real photograph of Hawking that shows him either on one of Epstein's private islands or on nearby St. Thomas Island, at an Epstein-sponsored conference. It was taken in March 2006, a few months before Epstein was charged with multiple counts of unlawful sex with a minor.  March 2006 charged Epstein, a financier who was later charged with sex trafficking, died in his prison cell in 2021 while awaiting trial (he previously had been convicted of other sex offenses). But before his fall, he was known for his parties and his extensive connections with high-profile celebrities, politicians, and intellectuals. He owned two private islands, Great St. James and Little St. James, which were prominent features in the civil and criminal cases against him. Numerous young women said in court papers that they were taken via private jet to Little St. James, where they were ordered to perform sex acts with Epstein and other men.  died owned said Hawking was just one of many scientists and intellectuals invited to these islands for less-sinister reasons  a scientific conference Epstein paid for. So how was Hawking brought into Epstein's orbit? For years, Epstein financed the Edge Foundation, billed as a salon for elite thinkers, which hosted prominent gatherings of scientists and intellectuals, and gave Epstein access to such circles. According to a Buzzfeed News investigation, Epstein's donations helped Edge carry out most of its activities, including an annual \"billionaires dinner\" that ceased to take place after his last contribution in 2015.  financed billed investigation An archived page from Edge.org describing Epstein's involvement can be seen here, where he was described as \"a financier and science philanthropist.\" The website stated, \"He is one of the largest supporters of individual scientists, including theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and Nobel Laureates Gerard 't Hooft, David Gross and Frank Wilczek.\"  Edge.org here In 2006, Epstein sponsored a conference at the neighboring St. Thomas Island. Per a March 2006 report in the St. Thomas Source, a local newspaper, prominent scientists gathered in a series of private meetings dubbed \"Confronting Gravity: A workshop to explore fundamental questions in physics and cosmology.\" Among those scientists was Hawking.  March 2006 Epstein was also described by the local report as the \"driving force behind the conference.\" He reportedly said to the paper that he brought the group to St. Thomas with hopes that the relaxed setting would free the physicists' minds to explore one of the 20th century's last unanswered physics questions: What is gravity? described \"There is no agenda except fun and physics, and that's fun with a capital 'F,'\" Epstein reportedly said. reportedly The New York Times also reported in 2019 on Hawking's trip to this island (emphasis, ours): reported It was a five-day gathering in the Caribbean of some of the world's top scientists, including Dr. Hawking, to share ideas about gravity and cosmology, with scuba and catamaran excursions on the side. One evening, the participants had dinner on the beach at Mr. Epstein's private island. Some of the scientists noticed that Mr. Epstein \"was always followed by a group of something like three or four young women,\" as Alan Guth, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, put it in an email to The Times, but they did not probe further. In another 2019 report, The New York Times described how, \"Once, the scientists  including Mr. Hawking  crowded on board a submarine that Mr. Epstein had chartered.\"  2019 report But where did the photograph come from? In 2006, The Edge Foundation also published a blog post on the conference and interviewed an attendee and organizer, theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss. Per the post (emphasis, ours): The Edge Foundation post The topic of the meeting was \"Confronting Gravity.\" Krauss intended to have \"a meeting where people would look forward to the key issues facing fundamental physics and cosmology\". They could meet, discuss, relax on the beach, and take a trip to the nearby private island retreat of the science philanthropist Jeffrey Epstein, who funded the event. We scrolled to the bottom of the page and found photographs of Hawking and more from the gathering. The photograph in question showed Hawking seated alongside Nobel Prize winner David Gross, and physicists Kip Thorne and Lisa Randall. Yet another shows Hawking on what appears to be the interior of a boat, captioned, \"Lawrence Krauss and Stephen Hawking on the way to Atlantis Submarine.\"  page \n(Screenshot via Edge.org) The New York Times described Epstein's allure for these scientists: The New York Times The lure for some of the scientists was Mr. Epstein's money. He dangled financing for their pet projects. Some of the scientists said that the prospect of financing blinded them to the seriousness of his sexual transgressions, and even led them to give credence to some of Mr. Epstein's half-baked scientific musings. The photograph of Hawking has been disseminated in the media, and is also publicly available on the website of the foundation once financed by Epstein, along with a description of the conference he attended, with the dates and details of the gathering matching up with reliable media reports.

            "Some social media users turned a private moment between Trump and a veteran into accusations of news bias. "
        ],
        "justification": "On 16 March 2019, an image of President Donald Trump bestowing a Purple Heart decoration on a wounded veteran named Clint Trial went viral after a Facebook user shared it along with the claim that the event \"didn't make the news\": Facebook user shared   The text of the meme reads: \"The President Awarding a Purple Heart to Marine MSGT Clint Trial. This Didn't Make the News, Share, Because It Should Have.\" This is a genuine photograph of President Trump awarding a Purple Heart to a wounded veteran reportedly named Clint Trial. While the majority of \"news media blackout\" claims that we've encountered  an allegation often levied in an attempt to either spread fake news or to push narratives of biased reporting  have proved false, in this case, it's true that mainstream news outlets provided little (if any) coverage of this event. fake news narratives biased So why didn't this photograph make the news? While many social media users shared this image as \"evidence\" of the news media's alleged bias against President Trump, that claim wasn't supported by what we found. If this were simply a case of \"liberally biased\" mainstream media outlets ignoring a positive story about President Trump, we would still expect coverage of this event to turn up in conservative-leaning news outlets. However, we found almost no information about this veteran's receiving a Purple Heart from President Trump in any news outlets, regardless of their perceived political leanings. The only article we could turn up was published in a Pennsylvania newspaper, the Titusville Herald, on 16 February 2019. That paper reported on the event not because of its national importance, but because of the pictured veteran's family ties to Saegertown, Penn. Titusville Herald The report also contained an editor's note explaining that the veteran's surname was omitted due to a request for privacy: \"*Editors note: There are two Clints referenced in this story. One, simply referred to as Clint, is Luke McGills uncle, while the second is his father. The last names of Clint and his wife, Casey, have been omitted by request of the family for privacy.\" The event began with President Trump's visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland in February 2019 for his annual physical. While there, the president met with a few of the wounded veterans who were being treated at that facility: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center met   The Titusville Herald also reported that President Trump's visit with Trial was unexpected, and that no members of the press were present at the meeting. In other words, President Trump didn't meet with this wounded veteran for a photo op or with the expectation of garnering positive news coverage. The newspaper also reported that the photographs were taken by a White House photographer (not a press photographer) and were privately provided to the family as keepsakes: A Saegertown boy and his family got an unexpected visit from the President of the United States while meeting with an uncle who was injured in the military. Luke McGill, 11, travelled with his mother, Stacey Gotchy, of Saegertown, and his cousin to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, on Feb. 6 to visit his uncle Clint, a marine who lost both of his legs to a land mine in Afghanistan ... While they were there, Clint was asked if he would be up for seeing a special VIP visitor, according to Gotchy. Little did they know, the special VIP visitor would turn out to be the president of the United States ... According to Gotchy, the meet and greet was not political in any way. There was no press at the meeting, and the only pictures taken were by a White House photographer who provided images as keepsakes for the family. President Trump was very kind and compassionate, Gotchy said. There was nothing political about it. He was very kind, concerned and very respectful and you could tell his sole purpose was to make sure [Lukes uncle] Clint was okay and his family was supported throughout the process. The visit became even more special when the president learned that Clint had not yet received his Purple Heart. Casey reached out to the staff at the office with the request that the president be the one who pinned the medal awarded to soldiers wounded in the line of duty on Clints shirt. President Trump saved Clints visit for last and held an award ceremony with the family present. We haven't been able to track down the initial internet origins of this image, but it seems likely that the photograph was lifted from one of the personal social media pages of Trial (whose Twitter account is now set to private) or those of one of his relatives, and then turned into a meme and shared (against his wishes for privacy) with his full name. This meme does not appear to demonstrate any news media \"bias\" against President Trump but rather a private interaction that was never meant to receive press attention. President Trump didn't meet with this veteran for a photo opportunity, nor did the news media refuse to cover the event out of a desire to provide nothing but negative stories about the president. If anything, this meme seems to demonstrate that some social media users will exploit even wounded veterans in order to advance their own political viewpoints. A GoFundMe campaign to help Sgt. Trial with his injuries was established in March 2019: GoFundMe In mid-January 2019, Clint Trial was working overseas when an explosion caused serious injuries to his body, resulting in a bilateral leg amputation, traumatic brain injury, and numerous internal injuries. We want to make sure this warrior and his family never have to worry about future costs as he adapts his life to a new normal and learns to get back on his \"new feet.\" When you make a contribution to this fund, you will help ease this transition. Money raised with this fundraiser will be used to cover gaps in coverage for care outside of hospital bills, to include vehicle modifications, traveling costs for family members, moving expenses, and construction costs to ensure their house is properly adapted to ADA standards.

        ],
        "justification": "An image purportedly reproducing a CNN graphic comparing Presidents Trump and Obama \"by the numbers\" -- with the former seemingly recording a significantly higher job approval rating than his predecessor -- received a viral push on 8 August 2018, when Donald Trump, Jr. shared it with his 1.2 million followers on Instagram:   However, the image was a doctored version of a graphic that was originally used during a CNN fact-checking segment regarding a tweet posted by President Trump about his approval numbers: Presidential Approval numbers are very good - strong economy, military and just about everything else. Better numbers than Obama at this point, by far. We are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a Blue Wave, but there might be a Red Wave!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 5, 2018 August 5, 2018  CNN's John King fact checked this tweet by comparing Presidents Obama and Trump \"by the numbers\" from around the same point of times in their presidencies. The image posted by Trump Jr. showed his father with a 50% job approval rating, but the genuine graphic aired by CNN showed President Trump's approval rating at only 40%. Here's the original segment from CNN:  A side-by-side comparison clearly shows how a \"50%\" was digitally edited (quite poorly) in place of the \"40%\" number in the original graphic:   The job approval statistics used by CNN for this graphic were taken from Gallup. According to that polling company, which samples presidential approval ratings every week, President Trump had never held a 50% approval writing up to the point of the CNN segment. Gallup. Donald Trump, Jr. later removed the doctored image from his Instagram page. An expanded version of the chart began making the rounds in September 2018 in the form of a meme shared by Turning Point USA, a conservative group whose stated mission is \"to identify, educate, train, and organize students to promote the principles of freedom, free markets, and limited government.\" shared stated Apart from repeating the inaccurate \"50 percent\" approval rating for Trump and substituting year-to-date federal deficit figures with first-year-in-office totals for both Trump and Obama, the Turning Point USA chart faithfully copies the information provided in the August CNN segment.   As CNN correspondent John King pointed out in that segment, the numbers reflect favorably on Trump. In terms of comparing Trump to Obama, however, the meme omits important contextual information. First, the figures cited were snapshots of a particular point in each president's administration. They didn't reflect longer-term fluctuations and trends. Second, unlike Trump, Obama entered office in the midst of a devastating economic collapse. Trump inherited an economy that was already strong and growing. It's meaningless to compare the two without taking these factors into account. Unemployment rate: As stated in the meme, the unemployment rate in July 2018 was 3.9 percent, as compared to 9.4 percent at the same point in Obama's first term in office (July 2010). But that number fell during 2011 as the economy began to recover, and, apart from minor fluctuations, fell steadily every year thereafter. By December 2016 (Obama's last full month in office) the unemployment rate was down to 4.7 percent and still falling, as illustrated in this U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics graph: rate   Jobs added: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, total non-farm employment in the U.S. grew from 145.7 million in January 2017 to almost 149 million in June 2018 -- an increase of approximately 3.2 million jobs. The same source reported that by the exact same point in Obama's first term, the economy had lost some 3.5 million jobs since January 2009 (.6 million more than was claimed by CNN and the Turning Point USA meme). But, again, the recession was underway, and the economy had already shed nearly 3.6 million jobs during the 12 months before Obama took office. The employment rate began to improve in 2011 and did so steadily throughout the rest of Obama's two terms: employment   First year deficit: The Congressional Budget Office reported in March 2018 that the federal deficit stood at $665 billion (equivalent to 3.5 percent of the Gross Domestic Product) at the end of 2017, Trump's first year in office. At the end of Obama's first year, 2009, the deficit was $1.4 trillion (9.9 percent of GDP, the highest deficit as a share of GDP since 1945). It was mostly attributable to spending on the stimulus package meant to rescue the U.S. economy from the recession. Deficit spending didn't remain that high throughout Obama's tenure, however. In fact, the deficit during each of the last three years of his term of office ($485 billion in 2014, $438 billion in 2015, and $585 in 2016) was lower than the 2017 deficit, as well as the projected $833 billion deficit for 2018. reported $1.4 trillion deficit GDP growth: The growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product reflects the health of the economy in terms of the value of all goods and services produced in a given time period. As of the end of the second quarter of 2018, the rate of GDP growth was 4.2 percent (revised upward from 4.1 percent), as compared to a rate of 1.6 percent in the second quarter of 2010, Obama's second year in office. The quarterly GDP growth rate can be volatile, however. It reached or surpassed the 4 percent mark on four separate occasions during the Obama administration, including hitting a high point of 5.2 percent in the third quarter of 2014: 1.6 percent \nsource: tradingeconomics.com tradingeconomics.com Changes in economic indicators are a valid way of evaluating the effectiveness of presidents and their policies, but, as in the examples above, when they are taken out of context and oversimplified they can be more misleading than enlightening.

        "justification": "For dog owners who have noticed their furry friends regularly following them into the bathroom or pawing beneath the door and wondered why, social media posts offer this answer: Your dog is trying to protect you. The claim has made the internet rounds for decades and again came to the forefront when TikTok user mavandmel posted a video in December 2020 that showed her golden retriever following her into the bathroom. mavandmel   You know when you keep trying to go to the bathroom and [the dog] keeps trying to nose their way in or theyre always standing at the door, said the golden retriever's owner, whose video had been shared more than 48,000 times as of this writing. Wolves and wild dogs, they protect one another while one goes to the bathroom because when youre going to the bathroom, youre vulnerable. So, they stand guard! Snopes readers asked our team to verify whether this TikTok explanation accurately accounts for the affectionate toilet behavior of our furry companions. We found that though there is some level of truth to the claim, generally speaking, this type of behavior is one learned more from nurture than nature. For millennia, humans and dogs have grown alongside one another to form very special evolutionary bonds. In fact, research suggests that the domestication of dogs occurred at least 20,000 years ago, but likely closer to 40,000 years ago. It may come as no surprise, then, that the two species are capable of reading one another  from the dogs ability to understand both the words and tone of human speech to being able to communicate with its owner through facial expressions. research suggests understand both the words and tone of human speech facial expressions But do dogs carefully watch their toilet-seated owners in order to protect them? That remains to be scientifically proven. In the wild, wolves have been shown to mark their territorial boundaries using the scent of their urine  a trait that pet dogs have brought with them into their neighborhood environments. This same behavior suggests that both wild and domesticated canines use olfactory cues to communicate with other members of their species. And when it comes to protection, canines are known to defend members of their pack from predators and perceived threats, contributing to the strong societal and familial bonds that both wolves and pet dogs share with their families. mark their territorial boundaries protection  Members of the Yellowstone Druid wolf pack chase down an elk. NPS/Doug Smith  NPS/Doug Smith That loving connection extends to the human-canine relationship as well. Research published in the journal Science found that shared eye contact between humans and their furry companions increases concentrations of oxytocin  the so-called happy hormone  in much the same way humans may bond emotionally when they gaze into another persons eyes. That loving connection extends to the human-canine relationship as well. Research published in the journal Science found that shared eye contact between humans and their furry companions increases concentrations of oxytocin  the so-called happy hormone  in much the same way humans may bond emotionally when they gaze into another persons eyes. Human-like modes of communication, including mutual gaze, in dogs, may have been acquired during domestication with humans, wrote the study authors at the time, adding that wolves rarely engage in eye contact with their human handlers. We show that gazing behavior from dogs, but not wolves, increased urinary oxytocin concentrations in owners, which consequently facilitated owners affiliation and increased oxytocin concentration in dogs. While the scientific literature has shown strong evidence for communication and bonding through the act of urinating and other bonding behavior in both canine and human-canine relationships, it does not prove that dogs go into the bathroom with their owner to protect them. Rather, it more than likely simply reflects a desire to be closer to their humans.  Snopes spoke with Paul Mundell, executive director of the American Service Dog Access Coalition, who said that although he has not systematically studied the question, he is skeptical of the claim that dogs who look intently at their owners while defecating are seeking assurance that either the owner will protect the dog or vice versa. I think its more plausible to consider the habit established during puppyhood  if the puppy was picked up and moved while defecating in an inappropriate area, or if it was scolded or punished for defecating in a particular area, its reasonable that the puppy got in the habit of watching the owner to ensure all was okay while defecating, Mundell said. Conversely, if the pup was rewarded for defecating in the right areas, it may have set up the expectation that defecating may be followed by a reward  even if the owner hasnt maintained the practice. Mundell remained equally as skeptical when it came to describing the behavior of a pup following a person into the bathroom for protection, particularly as the bathroom is not likely to be considered an unsafe space. During thunderstorms or fireworks, for example, dogs will often turn to the confined, isolated space of a bathroom or bathtub for security. For some dogs, following a person into the bathroom is the same behavior they display whenever their person goes anywhere  they follow them in order to remain near them. This is most pronounced in dogs displaying hyper-attachment to their owners, said Mundell, comparing the bond to that of children with their parents. Going to the bathroom provides an opportunity for our furry friends to interact with their uninterrupted owners, who may otherwise be occupied with chores, the computer, or other things that distract from petting and attention. Finally, dogs live in an olfactory world, and Mundell says that the urine and feces humans produce contain uniquely personal mixtures of volatile organic compounds due to each persons individual metabolisms, diets, and microbiomes  all of which may be interesting and even rewarding information to the dog.",

Sincerely, The Support Staff\n Origins:  When I was an undergraduate many years ago, having grudgingly acknowledged that receiving anything personal or valuable through a mailbox shared with three nosey and habitually cash-strapped roommates was proving to be a losing proposition, I set off one day to rent a  private mailbox from a privately operated mail service near campus.  As I scanned the rental agreement proffered to me by the owner of the mail service, I noted that it included a clause obligating me to pay a $20 penalty for every piece of mail received at my box addressed to someone other than me.  (The intent of this clause was to stop students from renting mailboxes, then sharing them with several friends.)  I immediately objected to this portion of the agreement, pointing out that it was too broadly worded and would therefore hold me responsible for too many things over which I had no control: junk mail, misaddressed mail, mail sent to previous holders of my box number  in fact, the mail service owner himself could send (anonymous) mail to my box and then claim I owed him $20 for each item.  Given the number of heated arguments I witnessed between the owner and customers during the time I rented a mailbox there, I suspect the owner was in fact running such a scam on his less savvy renters. The same principle is at work with sites such as Word of Mouth, which attempt to lure the gullible into joining their \"services\" by spamming Internet users with ominous-sounding exhortations similar to the messages quoted above: People are filing (anonymous) reports about you!  Use our service to find out what they're saying!  But only a sucker would pay to find out what anonymous people are saying about him, since anybody (including the people operating the service) could be generating the gossip. And suckers is what they're counting on.  The user who follows the link  to \"view all reports in our system regarding this e-mail address\" is presented with a display like this one:  There's no \"report\" or any other useful information to be found here  just a notification that some anonymous contributor recently submitted an \"I HAVE INFORMATION\" entry on you.  (Word of Mouth doesn't store any information themselves, because doing so would make them subject to libel claims.) If you want to find out what this anonymous contributor supposedly knows about you, you have to communicate with him through Word-of-Mouth's ANONYMOUS EMAIL SYSTEM which  this is where the \"sucker\" part kicks in  is only available to Word-of-Mouth \"Power Users\": One-Year Subscription $19.97, Two-Year Subscription (BEST VALUE) $29.97.  This is how the scenario works: John Smith goes to the Word-of-Mouth site and fills out a form stating that he has information about Jane Doe.  John Smith doesn't have to actually enter any information about Jane Doe; he just indicates that he has some to share (and nothing in the Word-of-Mouth system verifies that John Smith's actually has any relevent information to share, that his information is accurate, or that he even really knows Jane Doe). Word-of-Mouth sends then Jane Doe an ominous-sounding message (like the ones quoted above) informing her that some anonymous contributor has filed a \"report\" on her.  If Jane Doe is scared enough to be suckered into paying a \"Power User\" fee to find out what the report says, she's provided with a means of (anonymously) contacting John Smith by e-mail and requesting that he share his information. But John Smith can completely ignore the request, he can claim he \"forgot\" the information he had to share, or he can make up anything he wants to say.  The user can't even be sure that John Smith really exists, or that he isn't simply an agent or shill of Word-of-Mouth hired to drum up business by filing \"reports\" on person after person. (Since the communication process keeps both parties anonymous, users have no recourse if informants spread false information.) This is a system ripe for exploitation, with absolutely no checks to guarantee any sort of integrity. Of course, since Word-of-Mouth's disclaimer maintains the site has \"no control over the content of reports nor the actions of  its users,\" that's all too bad  the site delivered what it promised, which was only to put the user in touch with an anonymous contributor, nothing more.  (Naturally, they \"offer no satisfaction-based guarantees, and do not generally offer refunds.\") Nobody needs to pay $20 to find out nothing. Update:  Since posting our original article about this scam in June 2003, we've seen Word-of-Mouth offer the same \"service\" from any number of web addresses, including:  \n wordofmouthresearch.com\n wordofmouthinfo.com \n wordofmouth.info \n wordofmouthconnection.com \n word-of-mouth-connection.com \n word-of-mouth.org \n wordofmouthinformation.org \n womr.biz\n womrc.biz\n researchbackground.org\n find-the-truth.org\n Same wolf, just a different sheepskin.

        ],
        "justification": "On 28 February 2017, Breitbart.com reported that big box retailer Target's stock had \"crashed,\" losing a combined total of $15 billion in investor wealth, because of the chain's announcement in 2016 that it would allow transgender customers and employees to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity: reported Targets stock value is now down by 30 percent since it sparked a consumer boycott by embracing the transgender political agenda. That 30 percent drop has slashed investors wealth by roughly $15 billion. On Tuesday, the stock fell to $58.78, down from its April 19 high of $83.98. In contrast, WalMart is up 3 percent since April, and Kohls is down less than one percent. Company officials indirectly acknowledged the consumer boycott. Our fourth-quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores, Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a company statement. The company also admitted that it would likely continue to experience losses through the year. On 19 April 2016, Target announced that transgender customers and employees were free to use the restroom that corresponded to their gender identity amid a national row on the subject during the 2016 election cycle. The announcement came after North Carolina enacted the controversial HB 2 in March 2016, a law that came to be colloquially termed the \"bathroom bill,\" and required public single-sex restrooms only be used by people of the corresponding biological sex. The controversy, and Target's definitive stance, prompted conservative groups like the American Family Association (AFA) to launch a boycott. Nearly 1.5 million people have signed the AFA's petition as of 1 March 2017. announced HB 2 boycott Target shares did plunge on 28 February 2017, but it wasn't due to its nearly year-old bathroom policy. The drop was due to 2017 guidance announced during an investor day event. Projections were far lower than expected by Wall Street analysts (the term \"guidance\" means projected earnings). The drop in Target stock corresponds to the announcement made at their investor event: event  Source: Yahoo! Finance  According to Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbough, Wall Street was expecting Target to project earnings of $5.30 per share, but the company instead gave guidance of $3.80 to $4.20 per share which was \"well below\" expectations, prompting the drop in share value. According to Reuters, Target's dive dragged others down with it: Targets plunge prompted declines across the retail sector. Wal-Mart Stores Inc was down 2.0 percent, with Kroger Co down 1.2 percent and Macy's Inc off 1.7 percent. Dollar General Corp fell 4.2 percent. What is dogging Target and other retailers has been competition with all-online retailers like Amazon, which do not have the overhead cost of brick-and-mortar locations. Target, for example, has 1,803 stores. \"Online players dont have a huge network of stores and since they dont have that cost, they can offer lower prices,\" Yarbough said. Customers also have the immediate ability to do price-comparisons with smart phones. These changing patterns are reflected in a statement given by Target CEO Brian Cornell: statement Our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly-changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores. At our meeting with the financial community this morning, we will provide detail on the meaningful investments were making in our business and financial model which will position Target for long-term, sustainable growth in this new era in retail. We will accelerate our investments in a smart network of physical and digital assets as well as our exclusive and differentiated assortment, including the launch of more than 12 new brands, representing more than $10 billion of our sales, over the next two years. In addition, we will invest in lower gross margins to ensure we are clearly and competitively priced every day. While the transition to this new model will present headwinds to our sales and profit performance in the short term, we are confident that these changes will best-position Target for continued success over the long term. Although Target offers online shopping, profit there tends to be lower due to associated costs like shipping and price competition from the likes of Amazon. Retailers are struggling to survive with more profitable in-store sales lagging, and lower profit margins due to a growing contingency of online shoppers: Although its e-commerce operation is growing quickly, Target reported its third straight quarter of lower sales from existing stores, citing \"unexpected softness\" and raising new questions about the health of large national retailers in the United States. Target also forecast first-quarter profit well below Wall Street estimates. Shares sank 13 percent, on track for their biggest one-day percentage drop in more than 18 years. Target's stock has lost a quarter of its value since the 2016 holiday season started in November, and is now trading at its lowest level since August 2014. Target maintains the bathroom policy has had no effects on its business, with company spokeswoman Erika Winkels telling us in an e-mail, \"We have made it clear over time that weve seen no material impact to the business based on the bathroom policy. We dont have anything new or different to share.\" A poor performance in the 2016 holiday season was also attributed to online sales outpacing foot traffic, but Target is, again, not the only chain feeling the effects: Department stores across the country are paying the price for underestimating Amazon this holiday season. Macy's and Kohl's both reported lower-than-expected sales during the all-important end-of-year retail period, and announced a spate of store closures that will lead to thousands of lost jobs. Sears has even been reduced to selling off one of its iconic brands after a double-digit sales slide. Industry observers blame online competition, as well as department store brands' own shortfalls in adapting to a fundamental shift in consumer behavior. Nevertheless, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, told us that Target could be worse off than it is: Its in a much better position than some retailers because its balance sheet is still robust whereas Sears and Macy's are in a very difficult position. With Target, it's much more about tweaking and reinvention at the edges. [The guidance] wasnt great, but not as bad other people. Saunders told Reuters that while Wal-Mart has been buoyed by successfully offering groceries, Target has not been able to keep up on that front, calling its grocery offerings \"confusing.\" Reuters \"Target is neither a full-line grocer nor a player with lots of niche specialty products; it is neither a high-end player, nor a price focused discounter,\" he said. It is difficult to say with certainty whether the Target's commerce overall has been negatively affected by its policy on transgender people. Although company representatives have maintained it has not, shortly after Cornell made the announcement, USA Today reported a study that showed the percentage of people who would consider shopping there the next time they needed something dropped from 42 to 38 percent. But the retail industry as a whole is facing a dramatic shift in consumer behavior, and retailers have struggled to keep pace with it. reported Target's late February 2017 stock drop, however, was the result of announcements made during an investor day event, and cannot be attributed to their policy on bathroom use.

        "justification": "Claim:  A 2-year-old boy died a horrible death after ingesting Resolve brand carpet cleaner. \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, 2004] \n\n\nSaturday, August 21, 2004 On Thursday morning I received a call. This call was from someone with whom I hadn't spoken in a while. I used to work with her and I've known her for years. We have been through a lot together; marriages, deaths, illnesses, births, family issues. Her name is Megan and ironically, as you'll see, she was also the very first person I ever shared Melaleuca with after I became a customer last August. When she called me, I knew something was wrong. She proceeded to tell me  that her son Dylan had been rushed to the emergency room and then, Life-flighted to Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh. The reason? He swallowed Resolve Carpet Cleaner. She was cleaning a spot of Kool-Aid from the carpet and had the bottle sitting right next to her. Her son Dylan, who had just turned two in July,was playing on the floor behind her. In the brief moment she had her back turned to scrub the carpet, he picked up the Resolve and squirted it in his mouth. By the time she turned around, he had already begun to convulse.  I want you to know that is a day I will never forget. They let little Dylan go at on Friday at 2 AM, less than 18 hours after he drank the Resolve. The cleaner burned and corroded everything it touched on its way through his digestive tract. They did have him sedated, and on life support and Megan did say he opened his eyes one time, and in those eyes, she said she could hear him saying, \"Mommy, let me go. Let me die, I hurt, I'm in pain.\" I could never imagine losing a child. But I do know that there is no reason why this child's life should have been taken. He died because of thoughtless manufacturers who don' have enough responsibility to make safe products.  Some of you may say she was negligent. Not so, she was sitting two feet from him. She set the bottle down for a second. I don't believe she was negligent at all. All of us, when we are cleaning our windows or bathtub or whatever, set the cleaner down next to us, while we wipe up or clean up the mess. We don't put it away in- between wiping something down. We do this every day.  We never think that it could be us. I know there are those of you who think, it will never happen to me, I have it up in a cabinet, it's locked up, whatever. That is fine and dandy, until it does.  There is only one way to prevent this type of tragedy from occurring. GET THE TOXIC CHEMICALS OUT OF YOUR HOME. Your child's life is not worth the risk you take by having them there. There are safer, less toxic alternatives. Melaleuca makes products that even if your child drank the whole bottle, nothing would happen to them. They are an extremely caring and responsible manufacturer. Here is something Frank VanderSloot, our President and CEO shared with us just two weeks ago at our convention: \"30 million bottles of our EcoSense products have been sold since they were introduced. In that time there have been over 200 cases reported of children drinking from our product. Out of those 200, there were ZERO injuries serious enough to be treated in any way and ZERO hospitalizations!  This is real, people! I held Dylan in my arms when he was born, I was at his baptism and his birthdays. Now he is gone. And there is no excuse! These products from store shelves are dangerous! His mother now has to deal with the guilt for the rest of her life. And as I mentioned, I did share Melaleuca with her. She was the first one  I thought of. She knew there were safer alternatives. She knew. But what she said when I told her was, \"Oh, it's like that Amway thing. My cousin is in that. I know all about it and I'm just not interested.\" She knew but I know she thought, never in a million years will that happen to me, I\"m careful. The guilt and pain have to be unbearable. She has to pick out a casket for her son. A tiny, child-size casket. She will bury her son on Monday (August 23, 2004). She will never see her son start kindergarten, graduate high school and college, she will never see him get married or have children and grandchildren for her to dote over.  She is going to have to deal with the stress in her marriage. And his younger sister will never see him again (She is only four months old). I am horrified to think of what Megan and her family are going through.  The only good that can come of this is for us to prevent this from happening to anyone else. Don't let Dylan's death be in vain. It's up to us to educate people. Every life you touch is potentially a life saved. You can never underestimate the power of one. Don't take no for an answer. I know there are those of you out there who have chosen not to join Melaleuca as a preferred customer; I know there are those of you who are thinking of canceling your memberships. And there are those of you who don't want to \"bother\" your friends because you don't want them to think you're pushy or a salesperson.  Let me ask you...What is your child's life worth? What is your friend's child's life worth?  A few moments of awkward discomfort that she might think you are trying to sell her something? If the problem is that you think you can't afford it and you don't understand that you're saving money over grocery store brands, well than skip going out for pizza! Don't get that manicure. Don't stop at Starbuck's for that double mocha latte. You don't really need those new shoes, you have a similar pair already. Buy safer products instead. If you don't want to buy Melaleuca, there are plenty of products at the local health food store.  They cost a lot more than Melaleuca but just get the Lysol and bleach and Tilex and Cascade and Windex with ammonia and Glade out of your house. Your child's life may at some point in time depend on it. If you do this now, you can sleep at night knowing that you don't ever again have to worry that your children could possibly suffer the same painful death that little Dylan did. There is no excuse.  What if this happened to YOU and you knew you could have prevented it, just by having safer products in your home? How would you feel if your child died as a result of something you chose not to do because you didn't have the money? Or what if your friend's child died because you didn't want to \"bother\" her? Sometimes people say they don't believe what we say about how dangerous the products in their homes are.  Send this to those people.  Maybe now they'll believe you. I have to go to a funeral on Monday. I will have to say goodbye to an innocent child. Because of a manufacturer's irresponsibility to provide safe products to their consumers. It is inexcusable. I have never been to a funeral of a child and I don't ever want to go to another one. Now I feel like when Megan said \"no\" I should have been more insistent. Dylan is not some child I read about in the paper.  He is not a statistic that I quote in my presentation.  He was my friend's son. He was a vibrant, adorable 2 year old boy, who had just gotten to be a big brother. He loved Blues Clues and ice cream and his trucks. He had many of those! He liked macaroni and cheese. He loved his dog and cats. He loved his parents and his baby sister. He loved his grandparents and everyone else he knew.  And if you don't have any children of your own maybe you have grandchildren, or nieces and nephews. The point is at some point in time, more than likely, you will have a small child in your home. It is your responsibility to be sure you provide a safe environment. Imagine how she feels having lost her son, imagine if it had been someone else's child over playing in her home!  This could have been prevented. If she had only listened. For those of you who are faithful Melaleuca customers, thank you! For those of you who are business builders and share Melaleuca with others, thank you, thank you, thank you, a million times for having the courage to share with others what you know is true. For those of you who have chosen not to be Melaleuca customers, for one reason or another, PLEASE, reconsider. I know you think this will never happen to you but that's what every parent thinks  until it does.\n Origins:  The letter quoted above first appeared in our inbox on 23 August 2004. It was attributed to Karen Ujcich, a Melaleuca sales representative who lives in West Virginia.  Melaleuca  Ms. Ujcich maintained to us that she did write a message about a child who died after ingesting carpet cleaner, but that its text had been altered several times during the process of being forwarded by others and that \"chances are that there is little left of my original letter\" in versions not sent by her.  She did not, however, provide us with either a copy of her original message or information that would enable us to verify the death of the child mentioned.  Moreover, although we have received hundreds of copies of this message from readers, none of them has varied in anything but minor detail from the version quoted above. This  account of the death of a friend's child has caused a fair bit of stir on the message boards of two parenting web sites where it has been posted, AmityMama.com and MamaDrama.com. Members of both those online communities were quick to doubt the story, and with good cause  there is no reason to regard it as anything other than  AmityMama.com MamaDrama.com fiction. Dylan of the no surname fails to check out. During the course of looking into this story, we asked the rumor's originator to provide us with the child's full name and the city where he lived for the purpose of locating his death certificate and obituary. That query too has gone unanswered. Yet beyond just the information about the child's identity being missing, the account itself doesn't hang together at key points. The description of how the tot came to harm tells of the bereaved mother having \"had the bottle sitting right next to her\" and the boy having \"picked up the Resolve and squirted it in his mouth.\" Resolve is vended in three formulations in the U.S., each of them packaged a different way, with none of them fitting both of those two descriptions. A child who helped himself to a mouthful of Resolve Triple Action Carpet Stain Remover wouldn't be described as having \"squirted it in his mouth\" because that formulation is sold only in a spray trigger plastic bottle. Similarly ruled out is Resolve High-Traffic Foam Carpet Cleaner  though it would better fit the \"squirted\" part of the description, this foam-dispensing aerosol comes in a can, not a bottle. Finally, Professional Resolve Carpet Extraction Cleaner is sold in a huge plastic jug; liquid contained therein is poured from it, not squirted. Too much of this story did not make sense, so we looked to the hospital where the toddler had supposedly drawn his last breath for information about this story. We contacted the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh to ask if a patient whose case matched that described in the e-mail had been admitted and treated at that facility. Granted, if there had been such a patient the spokespeople for the Children's Hospital couldn't be expected to comment on the medical care he'd received at that facility, but patient confidentiality rules would not prevent them from saying \"Yes, he was here\" or \"No, we never had such a case.\"   Melanie Finnigan of their Public Relations department responded thusly: \n\nGenerally speaking due to patient confidentiality regulations we would not be at liberty to discuss any medical information regarding our patients. That being said, however, we are not aware of any child being treated at our facility for poisoning from Resolve carpet cleaner as described in the email.\n\n The Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh is a big place. Even so, a toddler life-flighted in who subsequently died 18 hours later after enduring horrible pain and suffering would be remembered, especially in light of the many inquiries the hospital has fielded in the wake of this rumor.  (We were far from the only folks who called or wrote to ask about the boy who drank carpet cleaner and died.) We also contacted Reckitt Benckiser Inc., the manufacturers of Resolve carpet cleaner, to ask what it knew of the story. (Reckitt Benckiser may not be a name familiar to most consumers, but its products are very well known in the typical household: Lysol, Easy-Off, Old English, Spray 'n' Wash, Calgon, Woolite, French's mustard, Electrasol, Jet-Dry, and Air-Wick, for example.) They were unaware of any child's having being injured through the ingestion of Resolve Carpet Cleaner, let alone of one that died. Given that the product has been on the market since 1983, if it were the sure and deadly child killer the rumor makes it out to be, there would have been numerous other injuries and deaths in those two decades. Yet there weren't, as a few shuffles through various news archives confirmed  no articles about tragedies accruing to the product were to be found. Reckitt Benckiser Inc. Judged by what is contained in the product, it would have been a great surprise had there been any such news accounts, because the liquid appears to be primarily a formulation of soap and soda, with a drop of alcohol thrown in. (Which might sound suspiciously innocuous, given that Resolve is supposed to lift stains, but if a carpet cleanser is to take out the marks but not destroy the rug in the process, it does need to be relatively harmless. Strong chemicals might eradicate stubborn stains, but at the cost of burning holes in the carpet and discoloring fibers, outcomes that for most homemakers would tend to quell the urge to buy that product again.) Resolve doesn't contain any caustic ingredients. A typical youngster who drank a fair amount of the cleaner might foam a bit, vomit, or experience an episode of diarrhea (soap in particular has been known to cause those last two effects), but no lasting harm should ensue. Granted, there is always the potential for a freak allergic reaction to almost anything, but barring a particular youngster's previously undiagnosed lethal sensitivity to soap and soda, the product is safe for use around children. \nA look at Resolve's material safety data sheet confirms this  its only first aid advice regarding ingestion is \"Rinse mouth with water. Contact a physician or poison control center if symptoms develop.\" This is hardly the warning label the product would be mandated to bear if the concoction being vended contained the sorts of chemicals that would instantly send a child into convulsions or burn and corrode \"everything it touched on its way through his digestive tract.\"   data sheet Compare and contrast those instructions with the ones given about what to do if the spot lifter were to get splashed into the eyes: \"In case of eye contact, immediately rinse eyes with plenty of water, remove any contact lenses and continue to rinse eyes with water for at least 15 minutes. If irritation persists, get medical attention.\" In other words, if you swallow Resolve and yet later feel not quite right even after immediately rinsing your mouth with water, you're to telephone a poison control center or doctor to discuss your symptoms. But if you get the solution into your eyes and a lengthy rinsing does not suffice to make things better, you are to get yourself to a doctor or emergency room.  A product with the potential to be deadly if swallowed would be labeled in far different fashion, and the first aid advice emblazoned thereon wouldn't amount to \"rinse the taste of it from your mouth.\" Consumers can learn more about how to read the labels on household products and what cautions and keywords to specifically look for by visiting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's web page on the topic. However, as general advice, before attempting to use any cleaning product, always at least glance at its label, specifically looking for the words \"Danger,\" \"Poison,\" \"Warning,\" or \"Caution.\" When any of them are encountered, carefully read all of the item's label to ensure that the nature of the hazard is understood, as are how the product must be used and stored if it is to be handled safely. web page Attempting to drum up business for one's product by spreading false stories about those of a competitor is a filthy practice, but far from one new to the world of commerce.

Boys were named Noah 635 times, while 755 girls went through life as Emma since last year.\" The year before, \"Daan\" and \"Anna\" were the most popular names, the site said. But a journalist at Powned.tv did a little research on the report and found something completely different. Checking for \"Mohammed\"  and all its alternative spellings  the writer found that 636 babies had been given that name last year. PowNed.tv, the web site DailyWire.com aggregated their story from, is a Dutch blog owned by GeenStijl, a right-leaning site that boasts about being \"needlessly offensive.\" Both GeenStijl and PowNed.tv have been criticized for posting anti-Muslim and anti-migrant content. criticized Baby names in the Netherlands are recorded by the Social Insurance Bank (SVB) for social service purposes, and each year SVB releases a list of the most popular names and ranks them. (For example, Noah and Emma were the most popular boys' and girls' names in 2017, while Daan and Anna were the most popular in 2016.) PowNed arrived at their conclusion that Mohammed was the most popular boys' name for 2017 by tallying all of that name's variations and then weighing that total against the number of newborns who were named Noah in 2017, a methodology that's flawed, for obvious reasons. SVB ranks names by specific spellings, so if the variant spellings of any one name are tallied together, that approach changes the ranking order. Thus, \"Mohammad\" may be a less popular name on its own than \"Morris\" or \"Moos,\" but when all the different spellings of \"Mohammed\" are considered together, that name is more popular than either: ranks  It's true that if multiple variant spellings of the name \"Mohammed\" are entered into the SVB database, then the results document that 636 of the babies born in the Netherlands in 2017 were given that name. But if the same rule were applied to, for example, the names \"Lucas\" and \"Daniel,\" it would be clear that Mohammed was hardly the most popular boy's name in 2017. Almost 2,000 Dutch children were named for some form of \"Lucas,\" while more than 1,000 were given a variation of the name \"Daniel\" in 2017.

So when news broke that U.S. President Donald Trump was making the \"unprecedented\" move of having his name added to these stimulus checks, a decision that could potentially delay the arrival of these checks by several days, many citizens took to social media to voice their displeasure, as in the example below: millions of Americans social media   Trump's name is truly being added to the COVID-19 stimulus checks, otherwise known as Economic Impact Payments. As of this writing, however, officials at the U.S. Treasury Department insist this will not result in any delays.  The Washington Post first reported on Trump's decision on April 14, 2020. According to the news outlet, Trump's name is expected to appear in the memo line of the check, not as the payment's official signatory, and that this will be the \"first time that a president's name appears on an IRS disbursement\": reported The Treasury Department has ordered President Trumps name printed on stimulus checks the Internal Revenue Service is rushing to send to tens of millions of Americans, a process that could slow their delivery by a few days, senior IRS officials said. The unprecedented decision, finalized late Monday, means that when recipients open the $1,200 paper checks the IRS is scheduled to begin sending to 70 million Americans in coming days, President Donald J. Trump will appear on the left side of the payment. It will be the first time a presidents name appears on an IRS disbursement, whether a routine refund or one of the handful of checks the government has issued to taxpayers in recent decades either to stimulate a down economy or share the dividends of a strong one. Treasury officials disputed that the checks would be delayed. While Trump's name will appear on these stimulus checks, we can't predict whether these payments will be delayed or go out on time. A Treasury Department official said in a statement that \"absolutely no delay whatsoever\" would occur:  statement \"Economic Impact Payment checks are scheduled to go out on time and exactly as planned  there is absolutely no delay whatsoever ...

The video from TikTok user @mousetrapnews was viewed nearly 3 million time in just two days. The account is affiliated with The Mouse Trap blog: video   The news was reported by its narrator as follows: Disney World is lobbying to lower the drinking age to 18. Disney World is battling the Florida government in court to get a resort exemption. The exemption would allow anyone 18 and older to drink on property. This is clearly an attempt to generate more money for the Disney company. For the full story, click the link in our bio or visit mousetrapnews.com.

It's a solid read, we promise.\"    This comment appeared under the satirical video from @mousetrapnews. The article on the blog for The Mouse Trap began with a history lesson about former U.S. President Ronald Reagan and the 1984 National Minimum Drinking Age Act. The story then shifted to the supposed Disney World drinking age news, laying out the satire like this: article former U.S. President Ronald Reagan the 1984 National Minimum Drinking Age Act Disney World Drinking Age at Disney World May be Lowered to 18 ... Disney World is looking to defy the minimum drinking age act. The Walt Disney Company is currently battling the state of Florida in the courts over the minimum drinking age. Disney is attempting to lower the minimum drinking age on Disney property to 18. They are clearly doing this to increase their revenue at EPCOT and across Disney World. We all know how popular drinks are at EPCOT. Whether you are having a few different concoctions or drinking around the world, alcoholic drinks are a big part of the EPCOT culture.

        "justification": "In August 2020, a photograph showing the figures \"1f1b\" written on the back window of a vehicle started to circulate on social media along with a warning about an alleged tactic being used by sex traffickers to flag potential targets. Those sharing this meme claimed that this term stood for either \"1 female 1 boy,\" or \"1 female 1 baby,\" and that cars were being tagged with these codes by sex traffickers. The meme received a viral boost when it was posted to actor James Woods' Twitter account: posted   The text read:  A very close friend of mine was out today doing shopping with her child at the Bricktown Walmart. When she left the store a lady stopped her and made her aware of what was written on her back window (1f1b) im just going to assume that it stands for 1 female 1 baby. She was then informed that this is now how sex traffickers are tagging cars.. please please mothers, fathers, grandparents.. aunts & uncles. Be AWARE! Feel free to share! Wont be tagging my friend for personal reasons. The claims made in this viral social media post are unfounded. Police in Bricktown, New Jersey, have said that they are unaware of any such activity. But before we get to the police statement about this matter, let's take a look at the game of telephone that helped this rumor go viral.  The text of this post states that this happened to a \"friend of mine.\" When we read a little further, we see that this \"friend\" was warned about this new criminal tactic by a random stranger. Not a police officer, a news reporter, or even a Walmart employee  just an anonymous \"lady.\" The original post received a few thousand shares, but this post received far wider circulation. And the farther we moved away from the rumor's origins, the muddier the details got. One poster, for instance, informed people that this incident took place in Bricktown, Oklahoma City, despite the fact that there is no Walmart in this location. post poster When we try to boil down this rumor to its origins, we see that the claim is based on something someone saw on Facebook, written by a person claiming that their friend had heard from a stranger that the code \"1f1b\" was being used by sex traffickers to flag future targets. In other words, this rumor doesn't exactly have credible origins.  The local Patch website reported: reported Brick Township Sgt. Jim Kelly said the department had not been notified. \"We have no reports for anything like this,\" Kelly said. He also said the department has not been alerted by state or federal authorities of any information that indicates criminals are marking vehicles \"as a method for anything.\" It's simply another Facebook rumor without any facts, Kelly said. A new variant of this rumor popped up on social media in July 2021.    AND THIS, THIS IS WHY I CARRY! Not only do I carry but Im educated in how to defend myself if ever put in a circumstance like this!! Please be aware of your surroundings AT ALL TIMES!\n7/27/2021\nToday around 3:30pm between Prairie Grove and Hogeye, this truck had a black Tahoe stop in front of it. A man got out and began asking the female driver of this truck for directions. She rolled down her window but had her seat belt on and doors locked. As the man approached he punched her in her left eye and cut her arm. Thankfully she was carrying and grabbed her gun. He took off. She called the police and they advised her this mark 1FW on her back window is a human trafficking mark. She was marked somewhere and this man followed and when she was on a road alone, he made a move to take her. Thankfully, she is home with her family tonight. Please be aware of your surroundings. We are told they often mark mailboxes and trash cans too. This particular marking stands for one female white. Nor was this the first time that this type of baseless warning has gone viral on social media. In July 2019, for example, we wrote about the false claim that sex traffickers were flagging targets by placing zip ties on houses, mailboxes, or vehicles. In December of that year, a false rumor circulated that sex traffickers were laying down in front of vehicles in order to trick them into stopping. That same month saw the spread of another false rumor holding that roses were being placed on cars to mark potential targets.  false claim false rumor false rumor Human trafficking is a real problem in the world, but the schemes described above are not based on any real-world threats. In fact, The Polaris Project, a non-profit that runs the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, writes that the forced kidnapping aspect of the aforementioned rumors is one of the most prevalent myths when it comes to trafficking: The Polaris Project Myth: Its always or usually a violent crime. Fact: The most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it often involves kidnapping or physically forcing someone into a situation. In reality, most traffickers use psychological means such as, tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims into providing commercial sex or exploitative labor.

She married musician Neil Young in 2018. He was 75 years at the time the website published this headline: \"Neil Young and Daryl Hannah Expecting Their First Child Together.\" published married  The Madhouse Magazine website had a disclaimer page that described its stories as satire.  This item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The article originated with a website that labeled its stories as being satirical in nature. labeled According to the satirical story, Hannah became pregnant at age 60 and made the announcement on social media: A spokesman confirmed that Neil Young's wife, Daryl Hannah, is pregnant. This will be the couple's first child. Young made the announcement on social media as he posted an image holding a \"Prego\" tomato sauce jar with the caption, \"We are Prego!\" Hannah, 60, is in good health and is being monitored. It is quite rare to become pregnant after age 50, but she's one of a growing number of older new mothers in the United States  a trend that's bolstered by changing societal norms and new advances in fertility treatments. Several months later, several Twitter users spread the satirical story and described Hannah as becoming pregnant at age 61, not 60, around the time of her birthday, Dec. 3.  This tweet was posted days before Hannah's 61st birthday.  This reference to John F. Kennedy Jr. was about QAnon conspiracy theory supporters who really did believe he was going to come back from the dead. Of course, that was not the case. (Hannah and Kennedy Jr. previously dated before he died in a plane crash in 1999.) reference to John F. Kennedy Jr. really did believe previously dated  A tweet from Dec. 5.   The satirical story appeared to catch on in the middle of December.   We saw various accounts share the satire story on this day.  A snippet from the Madhouse Magazine story was also shared as a screenshot:  A section from the satirical story.  In the snippet, it said: Neil Young, 75, was giddy with excitement as he gushed at the prospect of a new baby. \"I understand we are up there in age, but don't let these old grey temples fool ya now. Just because theres snow on the roof don't mean theres no fire in the basement!\" Neil then did a few pelvic thrusts to emphasize his virility. \"You better stand back\" said Neil to the female reporters, \"You might get pregnant standing too close to me!\" Giving birth at age 60 may be rare, but just last year a 74 year old woman in India gave birth to twins. \"I have the Uterus of a 20 year old and the eggs of a teenager\", said Hannah. \"There was no IVF or anything like that, me and Neil did it the old fashioned way by humping like jackrabbits.\" The satirical story spread well beyond its Madhouse Magazine origins, including in a Sept. 13, 2021, article on heightzone.com. The headline read: \"Daryl Hannah Is Pregnant at the Age of 60 with Husband Neil Young, Couple Expecting a Baby Boy!\" We stumbled upon similar stories on celebsaga.com and mixedarticle.com. article on heightzone.com celebsaga.com mixedarticle.com We also found the purported news reposted a seemingly endless number of times on Facebook:  A question with an easy answer: Hannah was not pregnant.   This appeared to be a real photograph from 2018.   It's possible that the misleading story from heightzone.com prompted a surge in new posts around Dec. 14, 2021.   \"Wrong\" is certainly one way to describe \"satire.\"  In sum, the story about Hannah becoming pregnant was labeled as satire but later spread well beyond its origins. For this reason, we have rated this claim as \"Originated As Satire.\" For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor. why",

            "Does an automobile's dashboard fuel level icon indicate which side the vehicle's gas cap is on?"
        ],
        "justification": "Way back in the olden days of 2007, readers were asking us about this much-circulated bit of helpful advice concerning automobile fuel level displays: \nI have been driving for many years. One would think I would have noticed the little secret on my dash that was staring me right in the face the whole time. I didn't and I bet you probably haven't either. Quick question, what side of your car is your gas tank? You probably can't remember right away especially if you drive more than one car or if you do a rental while on vacation. My solution was to uncomfortably stick my head out the window, strain my neck and look. If you don't do this in your own car you definitely have done it in a borrowed or rental car. If you look at your gas gauge, you will see a small icon of a gas pump. The handle of the gas pump will extend out on either the left or right side of the pump. If your tank is on the left, the handle will be on the left. If your tank is on the right, the handle will be on the right (see attached images). It is that simple! Why don't the dealers share such important information with car buyers? I have on purpose asked many car salesmen since I found this out and 'THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS - NOT ONE DID'.\n As anyone who has driven a rental car well knows, it is indeed useful to have some sort of indicator on the instrument panel that reveals which side to refuel on. Sadly, \"The World's Best Kept Auto Secret\" (as the e-mail was often titled) was a bit of misinformation or a misunderstanding: while the indicator it described was real, the \"The World's Best Kept Auto Secret\" message misidentified its nature. The nozzle-and-hose side of the fuel level (or \"low fuel\") indicator, which is usually presented as an icon depicting a gas pump, doesn't consistently correspond with the side of the car where the fuel door is to be found, nor does its placement on the instrument array (left side versus right side) tell whether you should bring the passenger's or driver's side up next to the pumps at your local gas station.  There's no magic to it. Although \"The World's Best Kept Auto Secret\" will prove true for some vehicles, it won't for others, it's akin to the many folkloric \"tests\" for determining an unborn child's sex, it has only two outcomes (the icon's nozzle-and-hose side and the side the vehicle's fuel door is on match or they don't), so this \"secret\" will work  sometimes but not always. (Yes, we know that some vehicles have their fuel doors in the back, but there are so few of them that for the purpose of this discussion we might as well ignore that possibility.)  sex The fuel icons in modern cars do inform drivers which side to refuel on, but it's not the placement or shape of the fuel icon that carries that information: Nearly all newer models of automobiles include a small arrow or triangle next to the fuel icon that indicates which side of the vehicle bears the fuel door.  As seen in the graphic example displayed below, sometimes the arrow and fuel handle are on opposite sides of the icon; it's the former, not the latter, that signifies where the gas cap is:  There's no agreement among auto manufacturers as to which side the gas cap should be on (which, if they would just choose one side or the other, would solve the whole problem right there: you'd then always know which side of your vehicle to park closest to the pump). It would make more sense to consistently position the aperture on the passenger's side, both because it's easier to get out of your vehicle when you don't have to weasel your bulk past the gas pump you've just parked next to, and because should you run out of gas on the highway, it's a lot safer to pour more in when you're not standing next to the traffic whizzing by you. An argument can also be made for placing the gas cap on the rear of vehicles. Were it there, you would no longer need be concerned about getting any particular side of your car sidled up to the pump:  provided the rear of the vehicle were somewhat close to the refueling array, it wouldn't matter if the gas pump island were to the left or the right.  Yet another solution would be to have two fuel entry doors, one on each side. That notion, however, fails on cost. According to Rick Asher, a spokesman for General Motors, the cost of putting a gas cap on both sides of a vehicle would far exceed the value of the added convenience for the vast majority of people. Which leaves us right back where we started, which is having to make mental note of which side a vehicle's fuel door is on when driving rentals or other cars unfamiliar to us (or try checking the side-view mirrors to see where it is before pulling up to the pumps).

        "justification": "An interesting and highly lucrative con targeting those attempting to sell vehicles (and other high-ticket items) online works like the highly successful Nigerian scam, but while his bit of larceny also typically features businessmen from Africa intent upon closing odd-sounding deals, it plays on the victims' honesty rather than their greed: Nigerian scam [Collected via Facebook, May 2015]There is a scam going around and I was almost a victim of it today. I recently posted an ad on Craig'slist I was contacted by a person that sent me a check for 1500.00 for the item I was selling. When I received the check today it was for the amount of 4000.00. When I asked why the check was for so much they informed me that the extra money was to be shipped via western union to the shipper so the item could be picked up and delivered. I got suspicious and took the check to my bank to make sure this check was ligit. I was informed that it was in fact a fake. The bank told me that if I had cashed this check that it would have come back to me and I would be responsible for the 4000.00 and they would have access to all my banking information. I am asking everyone to please like and share this post to make it go viral so this does not happen to you or anyone you know or any hard working Americans. Here is a picture of the check below. Please take the time to like and share. Lets get this thing viral. [Collected via e-mail, 2003] My husband is currently selling his motorcycle online. Last week when he posted his bike he recieved an email from a hotmail account stating he was interested in buying his bike and he is located in West Africa. He mentioned that he knows someone in the US that owes him money and would like to get our address to meet and make the exchange and that he would pay for all shipping charges. Well, a friend of ours, his cousin is also selling his bike. And he got the same email, but from a different email and name. That sounds funny to me. Well, my husband re-posted his bike yesterday online and he received from another person just about the same email about him residing in West Africa. The scam works like this: Example 1: Dr. Dipo Morgans of Nigeria wants to buy your used car for $5,000. His friend, Mr. Okuta, will be sending you a cashier's check for $8,000. You are to keep $5,000 for the car and send the remaining $3,000 to Dr. Morgans. Example 2: Dr. Dipo Morgans of Nigeria wants to buy your used car for $5,000. He will be sending you a cashier's check for $8,000 on the understanding that you will forward $3,000 of it to the shipping company that will be transporting your car to Africa. In some versions of the scam, the buyer is not an individual but rather an agent for a firm that purchases cars on behalf of others, often diplomats stationed in foreign lands. This car broker is usually located in Africa. The \"reason\" for the inflated-value check will vary from one attempt to defraud to another. Currency exchange problems will be cited. Or a horrified buyer will realize he's had the check prepared for far too large an amount. Or the check is being sent by a third party for the full amount this other person supposedly owes the buyer. Or it's a refund check for a failed sale for something that would have cost more. Or it would take 30 days to clear a check from Africa, hence the need to have an American third party send the payment. The reasons are many. And varied. And false. Cars or motorcycles aren't the only items to attract this form of scam: those attempting to sell horses have experienced it too. It's not unreasonable to extrapolate those attempting to sell boats will be similarly targeted. What matters is not the nature of the item being offered for sale but its price  it has to be high enough to justify the seller's feeling comfortable in sending thousands of his own dollars to a stranger under the mistaken belief he's already holding an even greater sum in his hand. In another form of the scam, those advertising online for roommates are contacted by prospective apartment-sharers who want to send cashier checks to cover the first few months rent plus a few thousand extra and who require the extra be mailed back to them. Though nothing is being offered for sale, it's the same scheme  the check will turn out to be worthless, but usually only long after the roommate-hunter has mailed his own very good check to the con artist. The scam works because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) requires banks to make money from cashier's, certified, or teller's checks available in one to five days. Consequently, funds from checks that might not be good are often released into payees' accounts long before the checks have been honored by their issuing banks. High quality forgeries can be bounced back and forth between banks for weeks before anyone catches on to their being worthless, by which time victims have long since wired the \"overpayments\" to the con artists who have just taken them for a ride. Although this scam is in its infancy, real people have already been bilked out of thousands of dollars by it  in some cases tens of thousands. The con has claimed victims in communities across the USA, so don't let your not having heard about it before lull you into a false sense of security. That the game is new doesn't mean it's not dangerous.

            "We fact-check a series of claims about Japan's healthcare and medical insurance system."
        ],
        "justification": "Healthcare reform has been a perennial political project in American politics, from the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and those of Richard Nixon through Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and now Donald Trump. Both those for and against the concept of the United States' adopting a universal health care system often use comparisons between the U.S. and other countries to advocate for their positions, as exemplified by a 20 April 2018 post on the \"U.S. Democratic Socialists\" Facebook page featuring a widely-shared meme purportedly outlining the main features of the Japanese healthcare system: meme   We examine this meme point-by-point below: 1. 100 percent of Japanese have health insurance. This is basically true. Japan has universal health care, which means that everyone who lives there (except undocumented immigrants and short-term visitors) can access affordable care and is required by law to be covered by some form of insurance. For the most part, residents do this through two kinds of insurance, which are administered by the government: employment-based health insurance, and National Health Insurance (known as \"Kokumin Kenko Hoken\"). care Kokumin Kenko Hoken However, Japan's aging population, low birth rate, and economic stagnation have placed a burden on the country's universal health care system, so reforms to that system are under way. reforms 2. Costs are half of what is spent for healthcare in the United States. By the two most commonly-used metrics, this is about right. A country's health spending is most often measured in a couple of ways: the percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) spent on healthcare, and healthcare spending per capita (the total amount spent on health care divided by the number of people living in the country). According to 2016 data published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United States spends 17.2 percent of its GDP on healthcare, by far the highest proportion among developed countries. Japan spends 10.9 percent of its GDP, about two-thirds the relative amount the United States does. data In 2016, total healthcare spending in the United States worked out to be $9,892 per person per year, again by far the highest level in the developed world. In Japan that figure was $4,519 per person, which is less than half than the United States spends. 3. Japanese can choose their own doctors and see them twice as often as Americans Japan has what is known as a \"free access\" system, which means  as the meme correctly states  that for the most part patients can use whichever doctors and hospitals they choose.  According to the Health and Global Policy Institute, patients should get a referral letter before presenting at larger hospitals. This is partly because the free access system can sometimes mean individuals with only minor ailments present at hospital emergency rooms, creating a backlog for patients in more urgent need of care.  referral letter backlog Japanese people visit doctors even more than twice as often Americans do, at least according to OECD data. Figures from 2011 (the most recent year for which a direct comparison is possible) show that United States residents averaged four doctors' consultations per person that year in the United States, while in Japan the figure was more than three times higher, at 13 doctors' consultations per person that year. (In 2014, that figure was 12.7 doctors' visits per person per year in Japan.) Figures 4. Japanese have the world's longest life expectancy and the second lowest infant mortality.  This is true. According to United Nations data, a Japanese person born in 2014 could expect to live, on average, until the age of 83.6, the highest life expectancy figure of more than 200 countries. (Children born in Hong Kong can expect to live to 84, but Hong Kong is a territory of China, not a sovereign nation.) data Research has shown that the relatively healthy diet and lifestyle of Japanese people, as well as good healthcare, plays a significant role in their longevity. Research United Nations data also show that in 2013, the most recent year for which data are available, Japan had the joint second-lowest rate of infant mortality in the world, defined as the number of children who died under the age of one for every 1,000 live births. With 2.1 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, Japan was ranked second, along with Finland and just behind Iceland and Luxembourg. data 5. 95 percent of Japanese healthcare is not-for-profit. It's not clear what this claim means, so we can't really evaluate its accuracy. Does this mean 95 percent of healthcare providers operate on a not-for-profit basis? That 95 percent of procedures are performed on a non-profit basis? That 95 percent of all health care expenditures relates to not-for-profit providers? We do know that by law, hospitals in Japan cannot operate for profit, with the exception of large for-profit companies who build hospitals for their own employees. According to an analysis by Ryozo Matsuda, a health policy expert at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, 80 percent of hospitals are privately run. Facilities that provide care for elderly and disabled people (e.g., nursing home care, respite care, home care) can operate for profit, and according to Matsuda, most do.  analysis 6. The government sets all fees for medical services and drugs. That's true. More specifically, the fees are set by a government-appointed body called the Central Social Insurance Medical Council. A 2016 study in the journal Risk Management and Healthcare Policy described the system as \"a uniform fee schedule at national level,\" noting that \"All providers, no matter whether private or public, share the same prices for their medicines, devices, and services under this nationwide fee schedule.\" body study Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (Japan).  \"Overview of Medical Service Regime in Japan.\"\r\n  Accessed 25 April 2018.
