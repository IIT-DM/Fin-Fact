The long line of protesting drivers snaked around the Capitol grounds and Frog Hollow neighborhood shortly after Gov. Ned Lamont announced deaths associated with the virus have topped 1,300 and that restrictive measures, including a new order to wear masks in public, should continue for weeks. The loud but socially distant protest in Hartford followed similar large, in-person rallies in state capitals around the country, including in Pennsylvania earlier Monday and in Michigan, Virginia and Texas over the past few days. The protesters nationwide claim Lamont and other governors unprecedented orders to shut down businesses, close schools and order millions to stay at home to stem the spread of the virus infringe on civil liberties and do more harm than good for society at large, said Dan Reale, chairman of the Libertarian Party of Connecticut, which organized the rally. One slightly different aspect of the Hartford protest was that it primarily comprised demonstrators driving around in their automobiles rather than gathering in person:  The vehicle bearing the \"Your health is not more important than my liberties!\" message was in fact part of that \"Rally to Reopen\" procession in Hartford, having been captured in pictures by photojournalist Brad Horrigan that appeared in both the Courant's reporting on the demonstration and in an separate opinion piece about the protest: Brad Horrigan reporting opinion piece [While I lay in a hospital bed in Manhattan, forcing myself to breathe], in Connecticut  my home state  hundreds of people gathered in the capital city.

Your health is not more important than my liberties, someone had scribbled on a car window. The pain in my chest  which had persisted and grown throughout the last eight days  was now compounded by something else. I couldnt believe the state of my country.

            "Mitt Romney assisted in the search for his business partner's missing daughter?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Mitt Romney assisted in the search for his business partner's missing daughter. TRUE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, January 2012] \nSometimes, this facet of Romney's personality isn't so subtle. In July 1996, the 14-year-old daughter of Robert Gay, a partner at  Bain Capital, had disappeared. She had attended a rave party in New York City and gotten high on ecstasy. Three days later, her distraught father had no idea where she was. Romney took immediate action. He closed down the entire firm and asked all 30 partners and employees to fly to New York to help find Gay's daughter. Romney set up a command center at the LaGuardia Marriott and hired a private detective firm to assist with the search. He established a toll-free number for tips, coordinating the effort with the NYPD, and went through his Rolodex and called everyone Bain did business with in New York, and asked them to help find his friend's missing daughter. Romney's accountants at Price Waterhouse Cooper put up posters on street poles, while cashiers at a pharmacy owned by Bain put fliers in the bag of every shopper. Romney and the other Bain employees scoured every part of New York and talked with everyone they could  prostitutes, drug addicts  anyone. That day, their hunt made the evening news, which featured photos of the girl and the Bain employees searching for her. As a result, a teenage boy phoned in, asked if there was a reward, and then hung up abruptly. The NYPD traced the call to a home in New Jersey, where they found the girl in the basement, shivering and experiencing withdrawal symptoms from a massive ecstasy dose. Doctors later said the girl might not have survived another day. Romneys former partner credits Mitt Romney with saving his daughter's life, saying, \"It was the most amazing thing, and Ill never forget this to the day I die.\" So, here's my epiphany: Mitt Romney simply can't help himself. He sees a problem, and his mind immediately sets to work solving it, sometimes consciously, and sometimes not-so-consciously. He doesn't do it for self-aggrandizement, or for personal gain. He does it because that's just how he's wired.\n Origins:  On 6 July 1996, Melissa Gay, the 14-year-old daughter of investment firm Bain Capital managing director Robert Gay, took a train from her home in Connecticut to New York City and failed to return home.  According to contemporaneous news reports, Melissa had met up with two young men she knew, gone with them to a rave party on Randalls Island, taken several doses of Ecstasy, and then was last seen at a party in a park beneath the Whitestone Bridge in the Bronx.  When Melissa hadn't come home by the following morning, her parents said, \"That's when we knew something was not right\"; they called all her friends in an effort to locate her and then called the police. In the days following Melissa's disappearance, Bain Capital  whose partners and founders included Mitt Romney  all but shut down as the firm mobilized its resources to assist in the efforts to find Robert Gay's daughter.  As the New York Times reported at the time: \n\nAs the days went by and her parents, Robert and Lynette Gay, grew more and more frantic, they finally told Mr. Gay's partners at the private equity-investment firm Bain Capital. A few hours later, executives of the Boston-based firm were on the shuttle to New York for a huge volunteer effort, harnessing corporate manpower throughout the city and immersing professional baby boomers in a youth party culture many knew nothing about. \"These are investment bankers, lawyers and accountants, many of whom are out there in jackets and ties and wool suits trying to talk to kids with spiked hair and  nose rings who are young enough to be our kids,\" said Marc B. Wolpow, a managing director at Bain Capital, who was helping coordinate the effort. \"We basically learned this thing overnight. You'd be amazed.\" Bain Capital's partners closed down the firm and drew on friendships and connections to find volunteers for the search. R.R. Donnelly, the firm's printer, printed more than 300,000 fliers bearing Ms. Gay's picture and last known whereabouts. Duane Reade, a drugstore chain in which Bain Capital is an investor, had clerks at 52 stores insert fliers in shopping bags. Price Waterhouse, which does the firm's accounting, sent nearly 100 volunteers to distribute the posters, and Goldman Sachs, Bankers Trust and Morgan Stanley dispatched more than 60 people. Command centers to dispatch volunteers and get in touch with the press were set up at the Marriott Hotel at La Guardia Airport, the Donnelly offices and the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan. Volunteers with cellular phones fanned out to clubs like the Limelight and the Tunnel, the Lollapolooza concert at Downing Stadium on Randalls Island, parties in Tompkins Square and Central Park, to Madison Square Garden and the Port Authority Terminal.\n News accounts of the time made mention of the role Mitt Romney and other partners at Bain Capital played in helping to find their managing director's daughter.  The Boston Globe, for example, reported that: \n\nWhen Bain Capital Inc. executives learned the 14-year-old daughter of a business partner was missing, they responded by closing the Boston company's office and flew about 50 employees to New York City to look for the girl themselves. Yesterday, in their first day of searching, they pounded the pavement, plastered the city with 200,000 fliers and quizzed teen-agers at concerts and parks. But as of late last night, Melissa Gay was still nowhere to be found. \"Our children are what life is all about,\" said W. Mitt Romney, founder and managing partner of Bain Capital. \"Everything else takes a back seat.\" But Bob Gay just couldn't sit back and watch. [H]e walked the streets of Manhattan looking for his blonde daughter, who was last seen wearing a blue or red-striped shirt and baggy tan pants. Gay, who has worked for Bain for eight years, kept his ordeal to himself, confiding only in Romney. But Romney decided to tell the other 11 managing directors, and they decided that finding a missing daughter was more important than operating a $1 billion investment firm. The executives decided not only to give their time but their money, paying all expenses for the search for the fifth of Gay's seven children. That night, 16 employees flew to New York, turned a function room of the Laguardia Marriott Hotel into a \"war room,\" and got printing giant R.R. Donnelly to print 200,000 fliers with a color picture of Melissa. They also hired a private investigator and set up an 800-number hot line. Another 40 employees caught an early morning shuttle yesterday, and later were joined by about 250 colleagues from other Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs, Price Waterhouse and Bankers Trust. \"Most of us have children,\" said Stephen Pagliuca, 44, a Bain managing director with four children. \"That's the most important thing in our lives. It wasn't even a question. We just decided to do it.\"\n Melissa was eventually found six days after she disappeared due to a tip obtained when a teenaged boy who saw one of the televised \"Help us find Melissa\" appeals called 911: \n\nA Connecticut teen-ager who was missing for six days after she took a train to New York City was reunited with her family after the police found her at a New Jersey home where she was staying. Melissa Gay, 14, met her parents, Robert and Lynette, at the police station in Montville, N.J., at 2:30 A.M. and returned home to Ridgefield, Conn. We haven't really talked to her yet,\" Mr. Gay said from the Pierre Hotel. \"We just gave her hugs and brought her home.\" Mr. Gay, a partner in the private investment firm Bain Capital, launched a huge search with the help of business partners to help locate his daughter, whom the family had not heard from since [the previous] Saturday. Melissa left her parents' home that day, took a train to New York and never returned after attending a rave concert on Randalls Island. While at the concert, her father said, she took the drug Ecstasy and then \"wandered the city.\" During her wandering, her father said, she met a young man who took her to his parents' home in Towaco, N.J. The young man, whose name was not released, kept her in the home without his parents' knowledge, the police said. Officers went to the home in response to several telephone calls, but the police would not give further details. The Montville police said no charges would be filed.\n\n In a followup article several months later, the Globe noted that Bain Capital's partners had selected their search efforts on Melissa's behalf as their top accomplishment of 1996: \n\nLast week, the partners of Boston's Bain Capital Inc. drew up their annual list of accomplishments: Number one was the week they spent last July combing Manhattan in search of Melissa Gay, the missing 14-year-old daughter of one of the partners. \"It really overshadowed everything we did from a money standpoint,\" said Mitt Romney, the Bain Capital founder who won the 1994 Massachusetts Republican Senate nomination partly on his reputation as a venture capital wiz. \"The days and nights spent looking for Missy Gay were more valuable than some financial home runs that made the front page of the Wall Street Journal. I mean, money is just money.\" The 15 Bain Capital partners chartered a plane to New York to search for the missing youngster among the thousands of abandoned children and runaways who congregate in Manhattan. They didn't find her themselves. She turned up in Montville, N.J. The Associated Press reported at the time that she was dazed from a disorienting dose of a drug taken at a rock concert. Now back in school and fully recovered, Melissa and her parents are doing well, Romney said. The partners, however, are still taking stock of their visit to the dark corners of New York, putting up posters and talking to runaways outside seedy nightclubs and peep shows. Romney said he can't escape some of the images he carries with him from his week in the New York underworld. \"It was a shocker,\" he said. \"The number of lost souls was astounding.\" Romney said one partner still talks about a runaway he spoke with in search of information about Melissa. \"The girl asked, 'Why are you looking for her?' and he said, 'Because her parents miss her,'\" Romney said. \"She replied, 'I wish my parents missed me like that.'\"\n\n In a 2002 Globe article, Robert Gay credited Mitt Romney with being instrumental in organizing the search for his daughter: \n\nIn 1996, [Romney] helped Bain Capital partner Robert Gay find his 14-year-old daughter, who had disappeared after sneaking away to attend a rave in New York City. Gay, who had called Romney after several days away from the office, was flabbergasted when Romney hatched a plan to find her. \"It was the most amazing thing, and I'll never forget this to the day I die,\" Gay says. \"What he did was literally close down an entire business. He basically galvanized an entire industry that just doesn't do this, and got them all on the streets for 48 hours.\" With the Bain partners he brought from Boston and investment bankers they knew in New York, Romney set up elaborate search parties, mapping out territories of New York City and turning to a public relations firm for help. Within days, they'd been featured on TV news, and the teenager who had taken her home to Montauk, N.Y.  where she was shivering through detox after a massive dose of ecstasy  called hoping for a reward. Doctors told Gay she might not have lived another day. \"I'm not sure we would have gotten her back without him,\" Gay says of Romney.\n\n A 2007 New Hampshire campaign commercial for  Mitt Romney also featured Robert Gay giving Romney credit for helping to find his daughter: commercial \n\nMy 14-year-old daughter had disappeared in New York City for three days. No one could find her. My business partner stepped forward to take charge. He closed the company and brought almost all our employees to New York. He said, 'I don't care how long it takes, we're going to find her.' He set up a command center and searched through the night. The man who helped save my daughter was Mitt Romney. Mitt's done a lot of things that people say are nearly impossible. But for me, the most important thing he's ever done is to help save my daughter.\n\n  Other sources have since suggested that Melissa Gay's disappearance was the intentional act of a runaway girl, that her life was never in danger, and that she was on the verge of returning home on her own when a telephoned tip led police to find her.  But even they note \"theres no debate that Romneys quick and resolute action helped locate the girl.\" sources Last updated:  11 May 2012\n    Canellos, Peter S.  \"Bain Capital Recalls NY Search.\"\n   The Boston Globe.  8 December 1996  (p.

The displayed caption, however, does not capture a genuine exchange between a journalist and these vendors.

The editors explained in the article's title and opening paragraph that these captions were not factual: Medium We Added Some Details to Getty Photos of Those Terrorists Who Stormed the U.S. Capitol [...] See, most of the captions that come with those photos are minimally descriptive: Thousands of Donald Trump supporters storm the United States Capitol building following a Stop the Steal rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, D.C. The world needs to know who these people are, so we went digging. Are these really their names and circumstances? Nope  but thats not going to stop us from thinking they are!  While the viral caption for this picture is not real, the photograph is. It was taken near the U.S. Capitol the day of the insurrection and shows two unidentified vendors selling Trump merchandise.

        "justification": "Claim:  E-mail compares proposed changes in taxes after the 2008 presidential election. \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, June 2008] \n\n\nThis is something you should be aware of so you don't get blind-sided. This is really going to catch a lot of families off guard. It should make you worry. Proposed changes in taxes after 2008 General election: CAPITAL GAINS TAX MCCAIN: 0% on home sales up to $500,000 per home (couples). McCain does not propose any change in existing home sales income tax. OBAMA: 28% on profit from ALL home sales How does this affect you? If you sell your home and make a profit, you will pay 28% of your gain on taxes. If you are heading toward retirement and would like to down-size your home or move into a retirement community, 28% of the money you make from your home will go to taxes. This proposal will adversely affect the elderly who are counting on the income from their homes as part of their retirement income. DIVIDEND TAX MCCAIN: 15% (no change) OBAMA: 39.6% How will this affect you? If you have any money invested in stock market, IRA, mutual funds, college funds, life insurance, retirement accounts, or anything that pays or reinvests dividends, you will now be paying nearly 40% of the money earned on taxes if Obama become president. The experts predict that 'higher tax rates on dividends and capital gains would crash the stock market yet do absolutely nothing to cut the deficit. INCOME TAX MCCAIN (no changes) Single making 30K - tax $4,500\nSingle making 50K - tax $12,500\nSingle making 75K - tax $18,750 Married making 60K - tax $9,000\nMarried making 75K - tax $18,750\nMarried making 125K - tax $31,250 OBAMA: (reversion to pre-Bush tax cuts) Single making 30K - tax $8,400\nSingle making 50K - tax $14,000\nSingle making 75K - tax $23,250 Married making 60K - tax $16,800\nMarried making 75K - tax $21,000\nMarried making 125K - tax $38,750 Under Obama your taxes will more than double! How does this affect you? No explanation needed. This is pretty straight forward. INHERITANCE TAX MCCAIN: 0% (No change, Bush repealed this tax) OBAMA: Restore the inheritance tax How does this affect you? Many families have lost businesses, farms and ranches, and homes that have been in their families for generations because they could not afford the inheritance tax. Those willing their assets to loved ones will not only lose them to these taxes. NEW TAXES BEING PROPOSED BY OBAMA * New government taxes proposed on homes that are more than 2400 square feet * New gasoline taxes (as if gas weren't high enough already) * New taxes on natural resources consumption (heating gas, water, electricity) * New taxes on retirement accounts and last but not least.... * New taxes to pay for socialized medicine so we can receive the same level of medical care as other third-world countries!!!\n Origins:   Every  recent presidential election cycle has brought e-mailed forwards that paint the Democratic candidate as a proponent of a \"tax and spend\" philosophy (who will inevitably implement significant tax increases on taxpayers across all income levels) and present the Republican candidate as a model of fiscal conservatism, and the example quoted above fits this pattern.    However, this example is off the mark both in its broad strokes and in its particulars.  According to the Tax Policy Center's analysis of the candidates' proposed tax changes, the primary difference between them would be distributional, with Senator Obama's proposals favoring lower-income taxpayers and Senator McCain's favoring higher-income taxpayers: analysis \n\nMcCain: The average taxpayer in every income group would see a lower tax bill, but high-income taxpayers would benefit more than everyone else.  Obama: High-income taxpayers would pay more in taxes, while everyone else's tax bill would be reduced. Those who benefit the most  in terms of reducing their taxes as a percentage of after-tax income  are in the lowest income groups.\n The statements made about the candidates' proposals for changes in specific taxes (or implementation of new taxes) are also all erroneous or grossly misleading. as we note below: \n\nCAPITAL GAINS TAX MCCAIN: 0% on home sales up to $500,000 per home (couples). McCain does not propose any change in existing home sales income tax. OBAMA: 28% on profit from ALL home sales\n The statement that Senator Obama proposes instituting a 28% tax \"on profit from ALL home sales\" is false.  Both candidates' proposals would leave intact an existing capital gains exemption for the first $500,000 per household of profit from the sale of a primary residence.  Homeowners who realize a profit higher than the current exemption amount from the sale of their primary residences might pay more capital gains tax under an Obama presidency than they would now, but those instances currently constitute a very small minority of all home sales.  (For the purposes of this article, the term \"per household\" refers to married couples who file taxes jointly.) The mention of Obama's imposing a 28% capital gains tax as president is also misleading.   Senator Obama has indicated he would likely raise the capital gains tax rate, but he has not specified by how much  the 28% figure is a previous (i.e., pre-Bush) capital gains tax rate which Obama stated he would certainly not exceed while noting that his capital gains tax rate would likely be \"significantly lower\": \n\nQ: How do you plan to change the tax code when it comes to capital gains? How high will that 15 percent rate go? A: Well, you know, I haven't given a firm number. Here's my belief, that we can't go back to some of the, you know, confiscatory rates that existed in the past that distorted sound economics. And I certainly would not go above what existed under Bill Clinton, which was the 28 percent. I would  and my guess would be it would be significantly lower than that. I think that we can have a capital gains rate that is higher than 15 percent.\n\n The  Tax Plan Fact Sheet posted on Obama's web site says that he will \"create a new top capital gains rate of 20 percent.\"\n \n Tax Plan \n\nDIVIDEND TAX MCCAIN: 15% (no change) OBAMA: 39.6%\n\n The notion that Senator Obama is proposing raising the tax rate on dividend income from its current 15% level to a 39.6% is unfounded.  Obama has proposed taxing dividends at the same rate as capital gains, and although he hasn't yet specified a figure for the latter, he has already stated (as noted above) that he \"certainly would not go above\" 28%.  Also, the proposed increase would only affect households with income of more than $250,000 per year (a figure that encompasses about 2% of U.S. households.)\n \n \n\nINCOME TAX MCCAIN: (no changes) Single making 30K - tax $4,500\nSingle making 50K - tax $12,500\nSingle making 75K - tax $18,750 Married making 60K - tax $9,000\nMarried making 75K - tax $18,750\nMarried making 125K - tax $31,250 OBAMA: (reversion to pre-Bush tax cuts) Single making 30K - tax $8,400\nSingle making 50K - tax $14,000\nSingle making 75K - tax $23,250 Married making 60K - tax $16,800\nMarried making 75K - tax $21,000\nMarried making 125K - tax $38,750 Under Obama your taxes will more than double!\n\n This is an erroneous interpretation of federal income tax rates based on the premise that Senator McCain favors extending the temporary tax cuts instituted by the Bush administration in 2001 and 2003, while Senator Obama does not.  However, both senators said they would favor extending those tax cuts; the difference is that Senator Obama said he would not favor extending the tax cuts for households with incomes of $250,000 or more per year.  Since none of the tax tables listed above applies to that income level, their inclusion is irrelevant and misleading.  As noted at the head of this article, taxpayers in the brackets covered by these tables would likely see a greater reduction in taxes under Senator Obama's proposals than under Senator McCain's, an outcome reflected in the Tax Policy Center's\nestimate of how the average tax bill could change in 2009 under each candidate's proposals: estimate  \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\nINHERITANCE TAX MCCAIN: 0% (No change, Bush repealed this tax) OBAMA: Restore the inheritance tax\n\n Pretty much everything asserted about the inheritance tax (also referred to as \"death tax\" or \"estate tax\")  in these few short statements  that President Bush repealed it, that Senator McCain would maintain it at 0%, and that Senator Obama would \"restore\" it  is wrong. In general, estate tax currently applies only to estates valued at more than $2 million and tops out at a 45% rate.  The exclusion amount is already set to rise to $3.5 million in 2009, followed by a repeal of the estate tax in 2010, and then a reinstatement of the estate tax in 2011 with the exclusion amount reverting back to $1 million and the tax rate topping out at 55%.  repeal Senator McCain has proposed raising the estate tax exclusion amount to $5 million and setting a maximum estate tax rate of 15%, while Senator Obama has proposed raising the estate tax exclusion amount to $3.5 million and maintaining the maximum estate tax rate at its current 45% level.\n \n\n\n\nNEW TAXES BEING PROPOSED BY OBAMA * New government taxes proposed on homes that are more than 2400 square feet * New gasoline taxes (as if gas weren't high enough already) * New taxes on natural resources consumption (heating gas, water, electricity) * New taxes on retirement accounts and last but not least.... * New taxes to pay for socialized medicine so we can receive the same level of medical care as other third-world countries!!!\n\n Three of these five statements are completely erroneous: Senator Obama has not proposed a tax on \"homes that are more than 2,400 square feet,\" any \"new gasoline taxes,\" or \"new taxes on retirement accounts.\" The phrase \"taxes on natural resources consumption\" presumably refers to Senator Obama's \"cap and trade\" proposal for reducing carbon emissions, a proposal which would likely impose additional costs on polluters but isn't technically a \"tax\": cap and trade \n\nObama supports implementation of a market-based cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions by the amount scientists say is necessary: 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Obama's cap-and-trade system will require all pollution credits to be auctioned. A 100 percent auction ensures that all polluters pay for every ton of emissions they release, rather than giving these emission rights away to coal and oil companies. Some of the revenue generated by auctioning allowances will be used to support the development of clean energy, to invest in energy efficiency improvements, and to address transition costs, including helping American workers affected by this economic transition.\n\n As for \"new taxes to pay for socialized medicine,\" Senator Obama has proposed funding his health care plan through additional revenues generated by not extending the Bush administration's temporary tax cuts for persons making more than $250,000 per year.  Whether allowing a portion of already-scheduled expiration of temporary tax cuts to take place really constitutes \"new taxes\" is a matter of semantics. health care Last updated:  16 July 2008\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   Sahadi, Jeanne.  \"What They'll Do to Your Tax Bill.\"\n   CNNMoney.com.  11 June 2008.

CNN reported: reported Behind the skiers launching themselves off the 60-meter-high (196-foot) ramp are furnaces, tall chimney stacks and cooling towers on the site of a former steel mill that for decades contributed to the Chinese capital's notoriously polluted skies. The mill, founded in 1919, ceased operations more than 15 years ago, as part of efforts to clear the air in the capital ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics.

AFP PHOTO/Juan BARRETO (Photo credit should read JUAN BARRETO/AFP/Getty Images) The pictured women were members of an indigenous organization known as \"the Movement of 400 Peoples\" who were participating in an annual protest to demand the return of land they say was taken from them by the government. According to a 2008 report from the Inter Press Agency, the group has been holding such marches in the nude since 2002: Press Agency Every year, some 300 indigenous people from the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz march naked through the streets of the capital to demand land. But while their unusual form of protest certainly attracts attention, there is little chance that it will achieve their goals. The protesters, most of them from the Nahua indigenous community, are members of an organisation known as the Movement of 400 Peoples. The organisation suffered a heavy blow in 1992 when the police evicted them from a parcel of over 2,000 hectares of private land in Veracruz that they had occupied in 1988. Following the eviction, they began to demonstrate in the capital to air their grievances. First they demanded the release of 100 members of the group imprisoned on charges of squatting, theft, assault and murder. Once this had been achieved, they began to call for the restitution of the land they originally occupied or to be granted ownership of other land, as well as punishment for the authorities who evicted them 15 years ago. In 2002, during one of their annual visits to the capital, where they spend two or three months living in tents set up between the busy downtown thoroughfares of Reforma and Insurgentes Avenues, they decided to take off their clothes as a form of protest. Since then, they have continued to stage their nude demonstrations every year. Cevallos, Diego.  \"MEXICO: A Naked Call for Indigenous Peoples Right to Land\r\n  Inter Press Agency.  2 January 2008.

In second place, Iran executed at least 159, Vietnam at least 64, and 59 prisoners were put to death in the US. The number of executions worldwide last year was the highest since 1996, when 4,272 were carried out.

        "justification": "Claim:  Federal regulations require states to upgrade all street name signs to use mixed case lettering. MIXTURE OF TRUE AND FALSE INFORMATION Examples:  [Collected via e-mail, October 2010] \nA friend heard this on the radio today.  It was reported that there will be a federal mandate in 2012 that street signs must have a capital letter only at the beginning and the rest of the street sign must be in lower case.  He said the report stated that baby boomers were apparently having a difficult time reading the signs printed in all caps. I find this idea a little preposterous.  He indicated that it would cost Milwaukee, WI over a million $ to make the change.  it was also reported that there would be no federal grants available to assist in paying for the new signage.  Can this possibly be true?\n \n Is there nothing more important for the federal government to worry about than street signs? They have mandated... without any funding... that all municipalities change traffic signs to a combination of upper and lower case letters... have we not been able to read our signs until now? Have we been eternally lost?? Government needs to get a life ...vote\n \n I heard a gentleman telling a friend that President Obama was in New York City and didn't like the fact that the street signs were spelled in all caps.  He requested that Mayor Bloomberg change ALL the streets signs so they only began with a capital letter and he agreed, to the tune of $1mil+.\n \n The conversation at the local scrap yard was about a mandate either Federal or Washington State requiring the change of all the street signs to ones that contain upper and lower case lettering (I guess most have all upper case lettering). This seemed so absurd I did not believe it but the scrap recyclers were excited about the huge amount of aluminum scrap that would be coming. Given the huge budget shortfalls and proposed cutbacks by most everyone, I find it offensive that someone is even payed to think about the font of the street signs. I sure hope this is just a rumor.\n Origins:  In October 2010, news outlets reported on new federal regulations regarding street and road signs that would be taking effect before the end of the decade, as exemplified by the following excerpt from the USA Today national newspaper: \n\nIn a nod to the fading eyesight of the nation's growing number of aging Baby Boomers, the federal government is requiring communities around the USA to change street name signs from all capital letters to a combination of capital and lowercase letters. The government says that makes them easier to read. Cash-starved localities also will have to dig deep for new, more reflective traffic signs to make them easier to see at night, especially by older drivers. Under Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) regulations, communities have until 2015 to improve the nighttime visibility of roadside signs  such as stop, yield and railroad crossing signs. The issue is how well a sign redirects light from an automobile's headlights back toward the vehicle. Signs that fail to meet minimum standards must be replaced. Communities will be allowed to change the street name signs as they wear out.\n Unfortunately, the wording of some of these articles left readers unclear about exactly what the new federal regulations entail, leading to (mistaken) claims that officials in every state must upgrade all their street signs to used mixed case lettering by the year 2015. One of the new Federal Highway Administration regulations, as outlined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), addresses the retroreflectivity of traffic signs: MUTCD \n\nFor many years vehicle operators and the transportation industry have realized the importance of legible traffic signs and quality pavement markings for the purpose of highway safety and economical traffic flow, especially in low-light conditions. Light from a vehicle's headlights striking retroreflective traffic control devices bounces back to the driver's eyes allowing them to more easily see the road. Therefore, most traffic control devices are covered with retroreflective materials. These include transparent decals with embedded microprismatic reflectors for traffic signs and paint that has small sunken glass beads in the pavement markings.  Retroreflectivity is used to allow drivers to more easily see vital traffic control devices in nighttime and low-light conditions.\n The FHWA regulations require that states must upgrade post-mounted guide signs (e.g., stop signs, speed limit signs, pedestrian crossing signs) to meet minimum retroreflectivity standards by 2015.  States must also upgrade street name signs and overhead guide signs to meet minimum retroreflectivity requirements by 2018. A second  and distinctly different  FHWA regulation requires that newly-installed street name signs (or replacements for existing street name signs) must use a combination of upper and lower case letters rather than all upper case (i.e., capital) letters.  Signs executed in predominantly lower case letters are  generally easier to comprehend than signs written in all upper case letters (because the shapes of lower case letters have greater distinctiveness between them), so the new lettering requirements should make road signs easier for drivers (particularly older motorists) to read. The conflation of regulations regarding these  two new types of standards for signage  retroreflectivity and mixed case lettering  has created the  impression that all states must change every street name sign to used mixed case lettering by the year 2015 (at considerable cost to those states). This impression is false.  The only connection between these two standards is that if states have to replace some of their street name signs to meet the new retroreflectivity standards (which they are required to do by 2018), then those replacement signs must use mixed case lettering.  Otherwise, there is currently no requirement that states remove and replace street name signs which use only upper case lettering  such signs may remain in place until they reach the end of their service lives.

This was not a real statement from Perry's office, nor did WGAL ever broadcast it. Further, such election conspiracy theories that make claims about votes being \"switched\" are completely baseless. The fake statement appeared to first be shared at around the same time that members of the Jan. 6 select committee investigating the Capitol riot hadrecommendedPerry undergo an ethics inquiry for refusing to comply with its subpoenas. recommended The image was posted by several Twitter accounts, including former CNN journalist John Harwood, who asked, \"Is this a real statement?\" several Twitter accounts  The fictional statement, which also wasshared on Reddit,read as follows: shared STATEMENT FROM PERRY'S OFFICE I stand by my statement that Italian Satellites controlled by our own CIA with the help of the Italian government switched millions of votes from President Trump to Joe Biden. There was even proof of this on the Internet which has since \"mysteriously\" disappeared. There were also credible reports on the Internet that Chinese thermostats in American homes switched votes as well which also disappeared. While the image was doctored and the statement was fake, it's important to note that Perry did once push the baseless rumor about \"Italian satellites\" in text messages to then-U.S. President Donald Trump's White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, according toTalking Points Memo. The claim \"was never substantiated,\" The New York Times reported. Talking Points Memo reported Meanwhile, the mention of \"Chinese thermostats\" was a reference to a claim made by a Trump-era U.S. Justice Department official named Jeffrey Clark, according to The Washington Post. The reporting said that the Justice Department later dismissed the rumor as not being credible.

            "Surprisingly, this isn't the only story about Abraham Lincoln jumping out of a window for political purposes. "
        ],
        "justification": "In July 2021, Democrat legislators in Texas packed their bags and fled the state in order to prevent a quorum  the minimum number of legislators required to be present in order for a vote to take place  as Republicans sought to pass restrictive voter legislation. As the situation unfolded in Texas, social media users started to wonder about the historical precedent. More specifically, they noted that former U.S. President Abraham Lincoln had once jumped out of a window in an attempt to prevent a quorum back when he was a state legislator in Illinois in 1840.   Lincoln truly jumped out of a window in 1840 in an attempt to prevent a quorum. Surprisingly, this may have not been the first time that Lincoln pulled the \"they can't vote if I jump out a window\" tactic. More on that other attempt later. The above-displayed tweet is referencing an incident that took place at a Methodist Church that was serving as temporary legislative chambers in December 1840. Lincoln, who was a member of the Whig party at the time, was hoping that a lack of a quorum would stop Democrats from passing a bill that threatened the State Bank. But as Lincoln observed the vote, he realized that Democrats had been able to round-up enough members for a quorum. The future president had to think quick, spotted a nearby window, and made for the exit, followed by a few other members of the Whig party. While Lincoln's escape was dramatic, it was not successful. The quorum stood and the legislation was approved. Here's a newspaper clipping from the Illinois State Register recounting the incident:  11 Dec 1840, Fri Illinois State Register (Springfield, Illinois) Newspapers.com  11 Dec 1840, Fri Illinois State Register (Springfield, Illinois) Newspapers.com This incident is also recalled in Pulitzer Prize-winner David Herbert Donalds biography \"Lincoln:  Lincoln Nevertheless, he persisted, and in December 1840 he demonstrated the extent of his devotion to the bank in an episode that became celebrated as what he called \"that jumping scrape.\" The bank had been authorized to continue its suspension of specie payments only until the end of the legislative session, which was scheduled for the first week in December. Knowing that the bank would immediately be bankrupt if forced to pay out specie, Lincoln and his fellow Whigs hoped to prevent the adjournment of the legislature, now holding its first session in the newly completed capitol at Springfield. Of course, Democrats, who wanted to kill the bank, favored adjournment. The only way the Whigs could keep the legislature in session was by absenting themselves, so that there was no quorum. They left Lincoln, together with one or two of his trusted lieutenants, to watch the proceedings and to demand roll calls when the Democrats tried to adjourn. The session dragged on into the evening, and candles had to be brought in. Several Democrats rose from their sickbeds to help form a quorum. Rattled, Lincoln and his aides lost their heads and voted on the next roll call. Then, still hoping to block adjournment, they unsuccessfully tried to get out of the locked door. When the sergeant at arms rebuffed them, they jumped out the first-story window. Their effort was in vain, because the speaker recorded them as present and voting, and, with the quorum assured, the house adjourned and the bank was killed. The whole affair became the subject of much amusement among the Democrats, who ridiculed \"Mr. Lincoln and his flying brethren\" and noted that his celebrated leap caused him no harm because \"his legs reached nearly from the window to the ground!\" Surprisingly, this may not have been the only time that Lincoln jumped out a window as a political tactic. A few years prior to Lincoln's unsuccessful attempt in 1840 to prevent a quorum, local legend holds that Honest Abe made a similar attempt while legislators debated on moving Illinois' state capitol from Vandalia to Springfield.  We have not been able to find any contemporary records to confirm this account. However, two men who were reportedly at the Vandalia state house when Lincoln leapt from a second story window, recounted the incident in an article published in The Lancaster Examiner in 1900: The Lancaster Examiner One morning, when the body had been called to order, the presiding officer suddenly laid before the members the question of the capital location. Lincoln, who was the leader of the Springfield faction, saw that his side was in the minority. Several Springfield members had left town and had not returned. He saw, too, that the number present was barely a quorum. The friends of Vandalia to a man were on hand. At the door stood a burly sergeant-at-arms, who had evidently received instructions to stop any member trying to leave. It was plain that the Vandalia people meant to rush through the bill to make no change in the capital. Preliminary proceedings proved it. Lincoln had taken the floor, only to find how powerless he minority was. The situation looked hopeless. The tall, gaunt leader nodded to his followers and hurried to the corner window. A wooden sill 20 inches wide made a projection beyond the wall. Before his purpose could be divined and the officers of the House could reach him, Lincoln had stepped through the window, and let himself down until he hung by his hands from the sill. The distance to the ground was less than five feet. Lincoln dropped. \"No quorum!\" the Springfield minority shouted. Proceedings were blocked for the time being. Subsequently, when the absentees had returned, and when the session was about to close, it was impossible to further postpone the vote. Springfield won. Uncle John showed the window and described the scene in detail. The parson listened with a little smile, and nodded as he commented: \"Yes. That was the way it was.\" If you're surprised to learn about Lincoln's window jumping antics, you might want to read more about how the 16th President of the United States is a member of the wrestling hall of fame.  member of the wrestling hall of fame See also from Snopes: Were These Abraham Lincoln's Last Words?

        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  An Islamic bank is the majority owner of the Caribou Coffee chain. \nStatus:  Partly true.\n Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2002] \n\n\nAs you will see from the links below, Caribou Coffee is owned 87.8% by the First Islamic Investment Bank which, among other things has the following philosophy: \"Above all, ensuring that all activities conform to Islamic Shari'ah\" The chairman of their Shari'ah supervisory board is:  Dr. Yusuf Abdullah Al-Qaradawi\nChairman, Seerah & Sunnah Center, Qatar University;\nProfessor, Faculty of Shari'ah, Qatar University.  As you will see from the links below he is also on the supervisory board of \"Union for Good,\" which is a charitable organization to support Palestinians. Nothing wrong with a charity to help Palestinians, but here is a quote from the Union for Good web site:  \"The Al-Aqsa Intifada is the latest of a long line of affliction faced by the people of Palestine. Its ancestry dates back to the massacre of innocent men, women and children in villages such as Deir Yaseen and the illegal occupation of Palestine in 1948.\" You get the picture. Starbucks here I come!!!  https://www.firstislamic.com/sharia.htm\nhttps://www.firstislamic.com/caribou.html\nhttps://www.interpal.org/web/supervisory.htm\nhttps://www.interpal.org/web/cbackground.htm\n Origins:   In 1992, newlyweds John and Kim Puckett, both recent MBA recipients, developed a vision for a gourmet coffee company while \"hoofing around Alaska's Denali Park.\"  Pursuing that vision, they raised the capital to open the first Caribou Coffee shops in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1993.  (If you're wondering why anyone would challenge the now-giant Starbucks in this line of business, note that at the start of 1992 the Starbucks chain had a mere 116 outlets  Starbucks nationwide.) Unfortunately, the new venture was plagued by problems nearly from the start, and by 1996 Caribou board members were expressing concern about the company's operating problems. In 1997, Jay Willoughby, an operations expert from Pepsico, was brought into the fold; although the chain opened nearly 50 stores that year, its growth was halted at about 90 outlets in 1998 while the company sought to address its operating issues.  In 1999 the Pucketts were replaced by McDonald's veteran Don Dempsey as chairman and chief executive, but by the end of 2000 the company ran out of cash and could not raise any more operating capital from its investors (who had already kicked in more than $40 million through several rounds of financing).  So, in December 2000, Caribou Coffee Company, Inc. announced that it was selling a 70% stake (later to become an 87.8%) to Atlanta-based Crescent Capital, a deep-pockets investor backed by First Islamic Investment Bank of Bahrain for $80 million; founders John and Kim Puckett left the board, but CEO Don Dempsey stayed on to run the company for the new owners. First Islamic Should any of this be a cause of concern to coffee lovers, especially since Caribou Coffee is second only to Seattle-based Starbucks (albeit a distant second, with a couple of hundred stores to Starbucks' 4,700) as the USA's largest chain of non-franchised specialty coffeehouses? The impression many people are taking from the message quoted above is: \"Oh, no; Caribou is owned by Islamic militants, the same people who are trying to kill us!\"  That isn't what the message claims, however.  The protest was that the chairman of the First Islamic Investment Bank's supervisory board (which advises First Islamic on issues of Islamic law regarding its investments) was also on the supervisory board of the Union for Good, a coalition of charities (such as the London-based  Interpal) providing various means of relief to Palestinians. The message notes that there is \"nothing wrong with a charity to help Palestinians\" but then suggests Caribou Coffee should be shunned because of two sentences from the introductory paragraph on the Union for Good's English-language web site: Union for Good Interpal relief \n\nThe continuing aggression from the occupying forces against unarmed Palestinians coupled with the blockade, the destruction of the resources of state, not to mention random attacks on innocent children, the elderly and women as part of a collective punishment campaign has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians and the wounding of thousands more. The Al-Aqsa Intifada is the latest of a long line of affliction faced by the people of Palestine. Its ancestry dates back to the massacre of innocent men, women and children in villages such as Deir Yaseen and the illegal occupation of Palestine in 1948.  Moreover, the blockade has a crippling effect on the labour force resulting in the loss of the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian workers. This can only be termed a human catastrophe. Not only that, an economic disaster, a state of famine, the paralysis of all national institutions and public services, the destruction of the education system and a deterioration of the health situation are the natural outcomes.  In the light of what is mentioned above a group of international charities have collaborated in launching a human relief campaign to expand the circle of support to avert the threat and danger posed by the occupying forces. The aim is also to raise public awareness of the real tragedy of the current situation and to endeavour to ease the effects of the unjust and discriminatory sanction imposed on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.  This is done in solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters in support of their steadfastness in what is called the Itilafu al-Khayr Union for Good 101 Days Campaign: in solidarity with the people of Palestine to ease the effects of the blockade imposed by the occupying forces and in support of their steadfastness.  All the participating charitable organisations have agreed to form the Coalition of Charities which will co-operate and co-ordinate to support and fund relief, rehabilitation and development projects implemented by charities in Palestine to ease the effects of the sanction.\n Certainly the statements that Al-Aqsa Intifada \"is the latest of a long line of affliction faced by the people of Palestine,\" that Palestinians were \"massacred\" at Deir Yassin, and that Palestine has been \"illegally occupied\" since 1948 would be hotly contested by many pro-Israel groups, but it's hardly surprising to find a pro-Palestinian focus on the web site of a Middle Eastern-based Palestinian relief organization.  Perhaps some of us believe that all charitable groups should be apolitical (and those that aren't should be avoided), but the reality is that many charitable organizations are decidedly partisan.  (For the record, the Union for Good is not on the USA's list of organizations that support terrorism.) Al-Aqsa Intifada Deir Yassin illegally occupied However, Dr. Al-Qaradawi \"has certainly said he does not think acts of violence against Israeli citizens is terrorism,\" and he is noted for his virulently anti-American stance and other viewpoints that many westerners find abhorrent: \n\nAn Egyptian-born theologian, Sheik Yusuf Abdullah al-Qaradawi, with a history of anti-American militancy even longer than Sheik Fadlallah's, expresses a similar view. From his base in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar, the 75-year-old sheik has issued Islamic fatwas, or decrees, on issues like the need for Muslims to boycott McDonald's restaurants, and on husbands' right to beat their wives as long as they do not draw blood.1\n\n Granted, Dr. Al-Qaradawi's views were made as a private citizen rather than as an office of Caribou (and we've discussed on other pages that what a corporate board member does as a private citizen and what he does in his official capacity as an officer of  corporation are two very different things), so the political stance of a First Islamic Investment Bank advisory board member is not necessarily reflective of the bank's corporate policies. But given the nature of the Islamic Shari'ah, issues of business, politics, and religion are inextricably intertwined, and Dr. Al-Qaradawi did have a \"significant association\" with Caribou's banker, First Islamic.2  other pages Shari'ah In July 2002, the First Islamic Investment Bank announced that they had severed all ties with Dr. Al-Qaradawi, so the issue is now moot.  First Islamic also hired Washington, D.C., law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher to review its charitable donations, and they have certified that no charitable contributions from Caribou's coffers go to groups banned under U.S. law.

        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  The federal government called out National Guard resources to block protesting truckers from using I-495 (the Capital Beltway) in Washington. FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, October 2013] \nI just saw this being reposted by a large number of my friends:\n \n Sources within the U.S. Department of Transportation have revealed that their plan to use National Guard resources to close federally funded Interstate Route 495, circling the nation's capital, have been approved by unknown White House officials and will be implemented on Friday morning, October 11, in order to thwart the three day Trucker slowdown announced on the Capitol Beltway starting that date, using the federal government shutdown as justification. The National Guard resources to be used to thwart the truckers will include rifle toting National Guardsmen called up from units that will be coming in from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia. They will use heavily armed National Guardsmen on foot and using trucks, jeeps and armored vehicles, which will be stationed at all entrance ramps to the Beltway to block incoming traffic starting early Friday morning.\n\n Origins:  In mid-September 2013, a Facebook page for the group Truckers to Shut Down America was launched, promoting a plan for American truckers to go on a general strike over the weekend of October 11-13: Truckers to Shut Down America \n\nThe American people are sick and tired of the corruption that is destroying America! We therefore declare a GENERAL STRIKE on the weekend of October 11-13, 2013! Truck drivers will not haul freight! Workers will call in sick! Consumers will not buy or sell anything on this date! Stay home! Buy nothing!\n\n\n The goal of the strike wasn't expressed as a specific one, as different descriptions of the event referred to it as a protest over a number of various broad issues such as government corruption, \"upholding the Constitution,\" government fuel policy, and \"Obamacare that will bankrupt every American trucker.\"  Some descriptions of the event  referenced a general strike, while others described a plan to shut down Washington, D.C. for three days.  After the federal government shutdown began in early October 2013, a rumor claimed that the U.S. Department of Transportation would use the shutdown as an excuse to bring in National Guard units from neighboring states \"to thwart the truckers\" from staging their protest.   But as The Trucker reported, National Guard officials from those states asserted no such plans were in process: rumor reported \n\nWhile protestors with the \"Truckers Ride for the Constitution\" continue their steady journey around the I-495 beltway near Washington, D.C., spokesmen from the Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania National Guards have said units have not been called to step in as some media has speculated. \"We have not received any requests for assistance for the state highway,\" Maryland National Guard Spokesman Lt. Charles Kohler [said]. Kohler said [the rumor] was false. \"The state police would be the ones requesting our assistance for that type of mission,\" Kohler said, adding, \"Nor do we anticipate getting that request for that mission; it hasn't even been discussed or thought of.\" Kohler said he fielded \"a lot\" of angry calls from people who believed the report that the guard was going to interfere with the protest. He also said truckers were calling to find out how to avoid being caught up in the protest. Virginia Army National Guard spokesman Cotton Puryear also echoed Kohler's statement: \"The Virginia National Guard has not received any requests for assistance or directives to stage personnel and equipment for possible duty related to the 'Truckers Ride for the Constitution.' We are monitoring the situation and could provide support if directed by the Governor of Virginia, but at no time have there been any plans for any Virginia National Guard support related to the event.\" An official with the Pennsylvania National Guard also said they have gotten no orders to interfere with the protest.\n In the event, the number of trucker protesters who headed onto the Beltway in Washington on October 11 was relatively small; and although extra state troopers were on hand in Maryland and Virginia in case any problems developed, there were no reports of rifle-toting National Guard troops or armored vehicles shutting down I-495 or blocking entry ramps to prevent truckers from accessing it: \n\nPolice authorities in Maryland and Virginia reported no major incidents as a result of the much-talked about truckers protest around the Beltway. Drivers of tractor trailers had said they were going to drive slowly to block off parts of the Beltway to protest excessive government intrusion. There were police reports of about 30 tractor trailers with American flags and signs for their protest  \"Truckers Ride for the Constitution\"  driving at the same speed as the rest of traffic on the Beltway in Friday mornings rush hour. But by mid-day the truckers appeared to have broken into smaller groups amid already-heavy volumes of traffic and rain showers on a holiday weekend. The trucker protesters seemed to be but a mere blip on the traffic cameras of area police officials. \"Nothing materialized,\" [David Buck, a spokesman for the Maryland State Highway Administration] said of the truckers protest, which had taken on a life of its own online. \"It was pretty much a non-event,\" [Virginia State Police spokesman Corinne N. Geller] said. \"They continued to comply with the laws.\"\n The Washington Times reported that images from the October 11 event were being misleadingly used to convey the false impression that the protest was larger than it actually was: \n\nThe Ride for the Constitution organizers presented photos of trucks on the beltway as proof of some sort of victory. Many of those trucks were driving on the beltway as part of their regular job, not because they were participating in the demonstration. At one point, four tractor-trailers drove in tandem for a minute, but state police quickly broke it up. \"Ride\" organizers quickly photographed this momentary maneuver and posted it on the Ride for the Constitution website. The visual is accompanied by the 1975 song \"Convoy\" by C.W McCall, giving the appearance that the protest was a smashing success.\n\n   Shortly after the October 11 protest, a photograph was circulated via social media that supposedly documented a large influx of protesting truckers into Washington which was being ignored by the news media and suppressed by Facebook: \n\nYou are not going to see this on the news but there a big trucker\nprotest going on right now in washington d.c. they are blocking all the\nmajor highways in protest of what going on in washington. Facebook is\nblocking the liking and sharing of pics like this: \n\n That image in fact had no connection to the October 2013 truckers' protest in Washington, as the photograph was actually one of a series of pictures (shown here) posted back in 2009 as depicting congestion at a border crossing that occurred during a December 2007  truckers' strike in Italy. here truckers' strike Last updated:  14 October 2013\n ",

        ],
        "justification": "An item about a collection of U.S. tax increases which were supposedly enacted as of 1 January 2016 due to the provisions of the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as \"Obamacare\") was circulated widely at the beginning of 2016, but it was merely an updated version of identical claims circulated in previous years that set 2014 or 2015 as the imposition date for those tax increases:  Although the tax increases listed in this item did come to pass, they took effect at the beginning of 2013 (not 2014 or 2015 or 2016), were completely unrelated to the Affordable Care Act, applied only to very high-income earners, and have been overstated in this list.  These tax hikes were enacted through the passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, a compromise bill pushed through Congress as a partial resolution to the then-looming \"fiscal cliff\" crisis.  Under the provisions of that bill: American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 fiscal cliff \n  The top marginal federal income tax rate increased from 35% to 39.6%  The top marginal tax rate on long-term capital gains increased from 15% to 20% (not 28%).  The top marginal tax rate on dividends increased from 15% to 20% (not 39.6%).  Estate taxes increased from 35% of an estate's value in excess of $5,120,000 (in 2012) to 40% of the value above $5,340,000 (in 2014).\n It's important to note that the increase in marginal tax rates for federal income tax, capital gains, and dividends affected only those persons with taxable incomes over a $400,000 (single)/$450,000 (married) threshold.  It's also important to note that the previous estate tax rate of 0% was a special rule that applied only to the estates of persons who died in 2010 (the estate tax has since been increased to 35% for those who died in 2011 and 40% for those who died in 2012 and thereafter), and even today an estate tax  filing is required only for estates with gross assets in excess of $5 million (indexed for inflation).   estate tax The tax rate for dividends has also not increased from 15% to 39.6%: it appears someone has confused qualified dividends with nonqualified dividends. Qualified dividend earnings are tax-free for those in the 10% and 15% brackets, taxed at a 15% rate for those in the 25% up to 35% tax brackets, and taxed at a 20% rate for higher income taxpayers whose income surpasses the 35% tax bracket.  Nonqualified dividends only are taxed as ordinary income.  (Theoretically, a taxpayer with nonqualified dividend earnings who reached the top marginal federal income tax rate would be paying 39.6% tax on those earnings, but that's a condition that only applies to persons earning over several hundred thousand dollars per year.) dividends The list's reference to an \"income payroll tax\" increase from 37.4% to 52.2% is something of a mystery, as this is not a standard term for any type of government income- or payroll-related tax.  The only adjustment to payroll-related taxes resulting from the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was that a two-year old cut to payroll taxes which had previously reduced the rate from 6.2% to 4.2% for 2011 and 2012 was not extended.  Additionally, this item's coda claiming that \"not one Republican voted to do these taxes\" is completely false.  The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 passed Congress by a margin of 89-8 in the Senate with 40 Republican votes in favor, and a margin of 257-167 in the House with 85 Republican votes in favor. (The original claim undoubtedly refers to the House or Representatives' voting in 2010 to pass the health-care reform bill without a single Republican vote in favor, but that association is moot because, as noted, the tax increases listed above had nothing to do with that bill.) 89-8 257-167 health-care reform bill",

This reality has led to rumors that President Donald Trump's administration, or some of its members, have a financial interest in promoting specific tests as opposed to others that would be more widely available or more easily distributed. more widely available One claim that has emerged in this vein came from a report by Raw Story that asserted \"the Kushner family is trying to cash in on the pandemic that could kill millions of us.\" The basis for this claim concerns the health insurance startup Oscar co-founded by Jared Kushners brother, Joshua Kushner. Jared Kushner is the son-in-law of and special adviser to Trump. report On March 13, 2020, Oscar announced that it would be launching a testing-center locator for COVID-19: announced Today, Oscar, a tech-driven health insurance company, launched the first testing center locator for COVID-19 in the U.S., featuring more than 100 centers today. It is accessible to the general public and more testing centers are being added every day. However, the details of Oscar's testing locator have been described incorrectly in several viral social media posts alleging profiteering from the Kushners during the coronavirus pandemic. A well-shared post by a user named \"Boston Judy,\" for example, asserted that \"we didn't have testing because the Trump family circle wanted to wait till they could make a profit.\" well-shared post   Even if this assertion had merit, the actions Oscar took merely help locate unaffiliated testing centers. As an insurance company, Oscar does not manufacture, perform, analyze, or sell any actual COVID-19 test. Further, the test-center locator that Oscar developed is open to the general public and is not limited to people who get insurance through Oscar. Once a user has taken a short survey, the locator will provide the closest locations for testing in areas in which they operate. While the service also acts as a promotion for the company, it can serve as a testing center locator for any interested party. open \"Boston Judy\" later clarified that Oscar was not producing tests, but that the company would get to \"bill the feds for evaluating people for COVID and referring them to a testing center if they meet the criteria [for testing].\" While the legislation that would allow for such a reimbursement likely will include a fund for covering the cost of these tests, the legislation has not yet been finalized, and it's unclear that it would really be a windfall for Oscar, either. On March 13, 2020, U.S. House Democrats and the White House reached a deal on a package of legislation that included a requirement that insurance companies cover the full cost of COVID-19 with no cost sharing. As described by the Brookings Institute, this legislation, if and when it is passed by the Senate and signed by the president: described Would offer financial support to state governments by temporarily increasing the share of Medicaid spending financed by the federal government, require almost all forms of health insurance to cover COVID-19 testing without cost-sharing, and create mechanisms to pay for COVID-19 testing for uninsured people. In other words, while the government will likely be subsidizing insurance companies like Oscar, they are doing so to cover losses incurred by the requirement for full reimbursement to members. These laws, and the federal reimbursement they would authorize, would apply to any health insurance company in America, not only Oscar. would apply Joshua Kushner co-founded Oscar in 2012. His venture capital firm, Thrive Capital, holds a significant ownership share. According to financial-disclosure forms released by Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, covering the year 2018, the couple owned and received profit from shares of Thrive: co-founded financial- disclosure   This document also appears to assert that the couple divested from Thrive during the 2018 financial year:   Under federal law, executive branch employees are eligible to defer paying capital gains taxes on investments sold to comply with conflict of interest requirements. To take advantage of this benefit, the employees must obtain a Certificate of Divestiture from the Office of Government Ethics prior to selling the asset. Jared Kushner received a certificate of divestiture for, among other things, four Thrive-associated funds in February 2017.  federal law  selling the asset in February 2017 In a narrow legal sense, this removed the conflict of interest associated with his financial ownership in his brothers companies, according to Virginia Canter, who serves as chief ethics counsel for the nonpartisan Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), which also provided us with Kushners Certificate of Divestiture. But, she told us, his divestment does little to alter the appearance of a conflict of interest or reduce the risk of potential corruption, especially if he is using his public office to promote the private interests of his brother or giving him preferential access. The similarities between the Trump Administrations announcement of a website designed to locate COVID-19 testing centers and the website released by Oscar have been a source of speculation about undue access on Joshua Kushners part. source speculation That being said, the assertion that the Kushners as a family are involved in the business of COVID-19 testing is not entirely accurate. The company's coronavirus response so far is limited to an online form that allows users to find a testing location if their symptoms call for it. Health insurance companies are likely to be reimbursed for covering the cost of COVID-19 testing once legislation is passed, but this would apply to all insurance providers, not just Oscar.

            "During her 2016 Democratic National Convention speech, Michelle Obama asserted that the White House had been built using slave labor.  And she was right."
        ],
        "justification": "On 25 July 2016, First Lady Michelle Obama gave a well-received speech amid what was otherwise a contentious night at the Democratic National Convention, during which she asserted that the White House had been built by slaves. The remark was a relatively minor detail in Mrs. Obama's larger commentary about progress in the United States: \nThat is the story of this country. The story that has brought me to the stage tonight. The story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, who kept on striving, and hoping, and doing what needed to be done. So that today, I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves. And I watch my daughters  two beautiful intelligent black young women  play with the dog on the White House lawn.\n The First Lady made the remarks at around the 11:20 mark:   In June 2005, Congress commissioned a study [PDF] that looked into slave labor and Washington D.C.-area landmarks.  In the foreword, U.S. Senate historian Richard Baker explained that it had been extremely difficult to uncover the details, because slaves were not considered important to the history of the United States at that time: PDF historian \nNo one will ever know how many slaves helped to build the United States Capitol Buildingor the White House; or the homes of founding fathers George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison; or Philadelphia's Independence Hall. Indifference by earlier historians, poor record keeping, and the silence of voiceless classes have impeded our ability in the twenty-first century to understand fully the contributions and privations of those who toiled over the seven decades from the first cornerstone laying to the day of emancipation in the District of Columbia.\n According to the paper, slavery was legal in Washington D.C. until April 1862, making it impossible to imagine that enslaved people would not have built and maintained buildings there. A pro-emancipation broadside from 1836 condemned the practice of slavery in the nation's capital: broadside   Jesse Holland, a reporter, researcher, and author of the book The Invisibles: The Untold Story of African American Slaves in the White House, said that his own research indicated that at least two-thirds of laborers who worked on the U.S. Capitol building (and by extension, the White House) were slaves: research Through research, weve been able to determine that just about 400 of the more than 600 people who worked on the construction of the Capitol were African American slaves. Maybe another fifty or so were African American freedmen. These are people who had their papers to signify that they were free. So the entire building, the center of democracy in the United States, was created by African American slaves. \"A lot of people dont think about it, but the White House is a mansion in a southern area,\" Holland told us: \nNot only the construction as far as building the wall. They not only quarried the clay used for the bricks, they dug the foundation ... and they also were used on the interior work of the White House. Slaves were used in the construction of just about everything, including mansions and other government buildings, and they were used in the construction of the White House as well.\n The White House Historical Association reports that although the government did not own slaves outright, they did hire them from slave owners: reports \nThe D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African American  enslaved and free  to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings. Stonemason Collen Williamson trained enslaved people on the spot at the government's quarry at Aquia, Virginia. Enslaved people quarried and cut the rough stone that was later dressed and laid by Scottish masons to erect the walls of the President's House. The slaves joined a work force that included local white laborers and artisans from Maryland and Virginia, as well as immigrants from Ireland, Scotland, and other European nations.\n Slaves didn't exclusively build the White House or other monuments; but a review of historical accounts reveals they had a large role in that construction, one which went almost completely unnoticed and unrecorded for many years.

        "justification": "Claim:  A U.S. soldier named Bowe Bergdahl was held prisoner after being captured by the Taliban in 2009. OUTDATED Example:  [Collected via e-mail, March 2013] \nFacebook has a story circulating about a man held since 2009 as prisoner of war in Afghanistan. I could not find any thing on media about story on this and wanted to confirm. Soldiers name is Sgt Bowe Bergdahl, captured since 6/30/09. \n Origins:  Bowe Robert Bergdahl is a U.S. Army soldier who, as a 23-year-old Private First Class with an infantry unit, went missing on 30 June 2009 near the village of Yahya Khel in Afghanistan, adjacent to that country's border with Pakistan.  The circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's capture remain something of a mystery, with the military press noting that \"There  has been some speculation that he willingly walked away from his unit, raising the question of whether he could be charged with being absent without leave (AWOL) or desertion.\" After  Bergdahl's disappearance, the Taliban released five different videos (the last in May 2011) showing him to be in their captivity, and in 2010 the Taliban demanded $1 million and the release of Aafia Siddiqui (a Pakistani scientist convicted of attempting to murder U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan) as well as 21 other Afghan prisoners held by the U.S. in exchange for Bergdahl (threatening to execute Bergdahl if their demands were not met).   Efforts by the Obama administration to secure the release of Bergdahl in exchange for five Taliban leaders held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, broke down in early 2012.  In June 2013, the Associated Press reported that the Taliban were again considering the proposal: \n\nThe Taliban proposed a deal in which they would free a U.S. soldier held captive since 2009 in exchange for five of their most senior operatives at Guantanamo Bay, while Afghan President Hamid Karzai eased his opposition to joining planned peace talks. The idea of releasing these Taliban prisoners has been controversial. U.S. negotiators hope they would join the peace process but fear they might simply return to the battlefield, and Karzai once scuttled a similar deal partly because he felt the Americans were usurping his authority. The proposal to trade U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl for the Taliban detainees was made by senior Taliban spokesman Shaheen Suhail in response to a question during a phone interview with The Associated Press from the militants' newly opened political office in Doha, the capital of the Gulf nation of Qatar. The prisoner exchange is the first item on the Taliban's agenda before even starting peace talks with the U.S., said Suhail, a top Taliban figure who served as first secretary at the Afghan Embassy in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad before the Taliban government's ouster in 2001. \"First has to be the release of detainees,\" Suhail said when asked about Bergdahl. \"Yes. It would be an exchange. Then step by step, we want to build bridges of confidence to go forward.\" The Obama administration was noncommittal about the proposal, which it said it had expected the Taliban to make. \"We've been very clear on our feelings about Sgt. Bergdahl and the need for him to be released,\" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. \"We have not made a decision to ... transfer any Taliban detainees from Guantanamo Bay, but we anticipate, as I've said, that the Taliban will all raise this issue.\"\n Bowe Bergdahl was promoted (in absentia) to the rank of sergeant on 17 June 2011.  He was the sole American soldier held by Taliban insurgents until he was released in May 2014, after nearly five years in captivity, in exchange for five Afghan prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay. A much-circulated quote from Judge Andrew Napolitano (who serves as a FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst) posits that President Obama provided material assistance to the Taliban by engaging in the prisoner exchange and thus committed a crime punishable by imprisonment of 10 years to life, but it is exceedingly unlikely that such criminal charges would be brought against the President of the United States, much less successfully prosecuted. quote Last updated:  9 June 2014\n    Cloud, David S. and Megan Garvey.  \"Taliban Releases American Soldier After Five Years.\"\n   Los Angeles Times.  31 May 2014.

            "The South African comedian has always been vocal about his mixed-race heritage."
        ],
        "justification": "South African comedian Trevor Noah often talks about growing up under apartheid as the child of a black mother and white father. So if it seems a stretch that the famously mixed-race host of Comedy Central's long-running parody news program \"The Daily Show\" would call on non-whites to unite in anger against white people in South Africa, it's because he didn't. talks about The fake quote attributed to Noah has been circulating on the internet, in varying forms and countries, since at least 2017, according to an investigation by Digital Forensic Research Lab, a project of the international affairs think tank Atlantic Council, which traces the sources of online disinformation. according to In a nutshell, the quote calls on immigrants and black South Africans to unite in their anger toward white South Africans, who control most of the country's wealth. \"Whites in South Africa makes up about 8.7% of the population and controls over 85% wealth,\" the quote states, then continues, \"I say that your anger and outrage is misplaced. African immigrants don't own lands, don't run companies, don't operate trophy hunting companies, do not ship out capital to European banks.\" It's a toxic quote, considering that its spread online coincides with deadly xenophobic violence in South Africa. And even though it isn't authentic, it spread on various African websites and on social media. coincides with spread websites The sharing of the quote to U.S. readers got a boost from frequent purveyors of online disinformation, including Alex Jones' conspiracy site Infowars, as well as Jim Hoft, who runs the junk news site Gateway Pundit, and Jack Posobiec, a right-wing internet personality who helped spread the Pizzagate conspiracy theory.\n\nThe quote has changed over time. According to the Digital Forensic Research Lab, the earliest version of it has been on the internet since Feb. 20, 2017, when a Nigerian website published it and attributed it to Noah without any citations. It was then reproduced by a Malawian website with the claim that Noah gave the markedly unfunny monologue while hosting his comedy show. Infowars,  junk news helped spread  published reproduced The quote hadn't seen much activity since early 2017 but then reemerged with the start of violence targeting immigrants in South Africa in early September 2019. In 2017, Noah made a comment about race but it was the inverse of the fake one attributed to him. Noah told Canadian broadcaster CBC that apartheid represents one of the easiest forms of control, accomplished by \"[convincing people] that they are different  even black people by the way  and [separating] them into groups that now spend more time trying to fight each other than realizing that they all share a common goal.\" CBC Noah also authored a book entitled \"Born a Crime\" about his experience growing up under apartheid as a mixed-race child, as his parents' union at the time was a violation of South African law under apartheid. book For reference, the version of the quote circulating in the U.S. as of this writing states in full: There are about 2.3 million immigrants living in South Africa, this number includes other Africans, Chinese, Bangladeshi, Indians, middle easterners and Europeans who are not born in SA. out of this number, only 1.6 million are Africans. The 1.6 MILLION Africans mostly run small shops, vending, service industries, etc. They may lay claim to less than 0.00001% of wealth in SA. Whites in South Africa makes up about 8.7% of the population and controls over 85% wealth. Though there are increases in black CEOs and managers, these are mere servants and just a optical presentations. There are about 6000 European families who own over 85% of agricultural lands in south Africa. So when I hear south Africans claiming that other Africans are competing with them on dwindling/scarce resources, I say that your anger and outrage is misplaced. African immigrants dont own lands, dont run companies, dont operate trophy hunting companies, do not ship out capital to European banks. Yours is a misplaced anger, prejudice and xenophobia built up out of inferiority complex created by decades of apartheid and oppression. I dont see fellow African as a competitor but a fellow compatriot who is struggling to feed his family and have some comfort in this short life-time. If you feel undeserved in wealth distribution, please research again who controls that wealth and it has nothing to do with some Nigerian, Zimbabwean or Mozambican working in a restaurant or Ethiopian running a small shop, or a Ghanaian mechanic working hard in the sun.

On Feb. 1, Aditya Raj Kaul posted the clip, along with the following description: posted \"A woman did her regular aerobics class out in open without realizing that a coup was taking place in #Myanmar.

That's how it was reported by several news outlets including The Guardian, Los Angeles Times, and the New York Post, among others.  The Guardian Los Angeles Times New York Post Those descriptions contained a degree of accuracy. The video is authentic, and there is no compelling reason to think the footage does not show what it seems to show  the early moments of a military coup inadvertently recorded. However, evidence is lacking in relation to certain key factual considerations, such as when the video was recorded and what exactly the convoy was doing when driving towards the parliament. Taking those factors into account, we are issuing a rating of \"Mixture.\" The video is real. The woman shown in it, a physical education teacher named Khing Hnin Wai, posted it to her Facebook account at 3 p.m. local time on Feb. 1 (3:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time). It can be viewed in full here. posted it here   Her exact location is the Royal Lotus Roundabout, around 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) east of the buildings that house the Assembly of the Union, Myanmar's national legislature, in the capital city of Naypyidaw. The location can be found on Google Maps here. The following street view photographs, taken in August 2018, approximately replicate the angle from which the video in question was shot and the reverse angle, which shows the portion of the roundabout on which Khing Hnin Wai stood and danced: here   At first glance, the video may have appeared to have been created using a green screen backdrop because of the way in which Khing Hnin Wai's shadow cuts off abruptly, as shown below:   However, that apparent visual anomaly makes sense once the viewer understands that she was standing on a raised platform with several sets of steps behind her, leading down to the road itself.  Over the past several months, Khing Hnin Wai has posted multiple videos of herself dancing and exercising in the exact same location, further underscoring the authenticity of the footage posted on Feb. 1: multiple videos   In November 2020, she posted an exercise video, this time recorded from the reverse angle, meaning it showed the distinctive lotus sculpture at the center of the Royal Lotus Roundabout, further demonstrating that this was the habitual location for her aerobics videos. posted Khing Hnin Wai posted the video to Facebook on the day of the coup and wrote about it in a way that clearly indicates it was also recorded that day. According to a translation by Agence France Presse, she wrote on Facebook: \"Before I heard the news (of the coup) in the morning, the video I made for the aerobic dance competition has become an unforgettable memory.\" translation Though there is no compelling reason to suggest otherwise, we have not yet been able to verify that the footage was recorded on Feb. 1. If it was, then it's likely the activities shown in the background were indeed related in some way to the coup, which the U.K.'s Channel 4 News reported began with pre-dawn raids.  Channel 4 News However, on Facebook, Khing Hnin Wai herself noted that it isn't unusual for an \"official convoy\" to appear in Naypyidaw, which is the site of virtually all national governmental, military, and diplomatic headquarters of note in the country.  noted As a result, we cannot rule out the possibility that the footage  although authentic  was recorded before Feb. 1, and therefore showed activities that were not related to that day's military coup.

        ],
        "justification": "In August 2021, as the Taliban swept to power in Afghanistan, capturing major cities including the capital, Kabul, attention in the U.S. turned to President Joe Biden's decision to complete the withdrawal of American troops from the country, and the appearance of a frantic and hurried evacuation of diplomatic staff and certain Afghan nationals at risk of persecution by the extremist Islamist militia.  swept to power On Aug. 16, several news outlets and social media posts reported that National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan had, at least in part, attributed the startlingly quick return to power of the Taliban to a lack of willingness, among Afghan government forces, to fight back.  For example, Bloomberg News White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs posted a tweet that attributed the following quotations to Sullivan: posted Asked about last-minute scramble, despite Biden's assurances that wouldn't happen, [Jake Sullivan]: \"Despite the fact that we spent 20 years and tens of billions of dollars\" on the Afghan national security forces \"we could not give them the will\" to fight and they decided not to.   Similar quotations were attributed to Sullivan in reports by Business Insider and The Hill. Those remarks were authentic, and correctly attributed to Sullivan, who did indeed defend Biden's withdrawal decision, and said Afghan security forced did not have \"the will\" to fight to protect the capital city Kabul, or the country of Afghanistan. As such, we are issuing a rating of \"Correct Attribution.\" Business Insider The Hill Sullivan's remarks came during the context of an interview with Savannah Guthrie on NBC's \"Today\" show, on the morning of Aug. 16, which can be watched in full below. Guthrie put it to Sullivan that the \"last-minute scramble\" to evacuate U.S. citizens and government personnel from Kabul was indicative of a poorly conceived or badly executed withdrawal plan. Sullivan replied, in part, as follows: It is certainly the case that the speed with which cities fell was much greater than anyone anticipated, including the Afghans, including many of the analysts who looked hard at this problem. And part of the reason for that, Savannah, is because at the end of the day, despite the fact that we spent 20 years and tens of billions of dollars to give the best equipment, the best training and the best capacity to the Afghan national security forces, we could not give them the will. And they ultimately decided that they would not fight for Kabul, and they would not fight for the country, and that ultimately opened the door...to the Taliban to come into Kabul very rapidly [emphasis is added]. When Guthrie put it to Sullivan that the Taliban's rapid takeover of the country represented a \"worst-case scenario,\" Sullivan rejected that claim, and defended Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan: Actually, Savannah, I think the worst-case scenario for the United States would be a circumstance in which were adding back in thousands and thousands of troops to fight and die in a civil war in Afghanistan, when the Afghan army wasn't prepared to fight in it, itself. That was the alternative choice Joe Biden faced. And what we learned over the course of the past two weeks is that if we had stayed one more year, or two more years, or five more years, or 10 more years, no amount of training, equipping or money or lives lost by the United States was going to put the Afghan army in a position to be able to sustain that country on its own. So the president had bad choices. And the choice he made, which was to bring U.S. forces home, to get us out of that civil war, to get our diplomats out of the embassy, and to ultimately ask the Afghans to step up and fight for themselves. It is heartbreaking to see what's happening in Kabul, but the president had to make the best possible choice he could, and he stands by that decision.      ",

            "Does a provision of health care legislation impose a 3.8% sales tax on all home sales?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  A provision of \"Obamacare\" health care legislation creates a 3.8% Medicare tax on real estate transactions. \nMIXTURE OF TRUE AND FALSE INFORMATION:   \nFALSE: Health care legislation imposes a 3.8% tax on all home sales.\n\n  \n\nTRUE: Health care legislation imposes a 3.8% transaction tax on profits over the capital gains threshold.\n\n\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, April 2010] \n3.8% tax on real estate transactions Under the new health care bill - did you know that all real estate transactions are subject to a 3.8% \"Sales Tax\"? You can thank Nancy, Harry & Barack (and your local Congressmen) for this one. If you sell your $400,000 home, this will be a $15,200 tax. Remember Obamas battle cry  take from the workers and give to the drones. TAX ON HOME SALES Imposes a 3.8 percent tax on home sales and other real estate transactions. Middle-income people must pay the full tax even if they are \"rich\" for only one day  the day they sell their house and buy a new one. \n\n\n\n\n  Origins:  One of the provisions in the reconciliation bill (HR 4872) passed in conjunction with the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act (PPACA) health care legislation calls for high-income households to be subject to a new 3.8% Medicare tax on investment income starting in 2013: HR 4872 \n\nThe PPACA creates a new Code Section 1411, which will generally impose a 3.8 percent tax on the lesser of \"net investment income\" or the excess of modified adjusted gross income over a \"threshold amount\" (generally, $250,000 for taxpayers filing a joint return, $125,000 for married taxpayers filing a separate return and $200,000 in all other cases). Net investment income generally means the excess of (i) interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, rents, income from passive activities, income from trading financial instruments and commodities, and gain from the disposition of certain non-business property, over (ii) allowable deductions properly allocable to such income. In determining the amount of net investment income, special rules apply with respect to dispositions of equity interests in certain partnerships and S corporations, and to distributions from certain qualified plans. This additional tax applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012.\n\n This is a complicated section of a complicated piece of legislation, and the 3.8% Medicare tax has been frequently misreported as amounting to a 3.8% \"sales tax\" on all real estate transactions.  This is incorrect: the Medicare tax is not a sales tax, nor does it apply to all real estate transactions; it is a tax on investment income (income which may or not derive from the sale of property) only for persons who earn more than the amounts specified in the bill. First of all, the Medicare tax will be imposed only on individuals with an income above $200,000 and couples with a joint income more than $250,000, a figure which currently excludes about 97% of all U.S. households.  Second, the tax will not be assessed on every house sale, but only on real estate transactions that produce profits over a specified dollar amount.  As Sara Orrange, Government affairs director of the Spokane Association of Realtors noted in response to a repetition of the \"sales tax\" rumor in the Spokane Spokesman-Review: response \n\nIn his recent guest column regarding the impact of the health care bill, Paul Guppy of the Washington Policy Center claimed that a 3.8 percent tax on all home sales was a part of the recently passed legislation. This is inaccurate and needs to be corrected. The truth about the bill is that if you sell your home for a profit above the capital gains threshold of $250,000 per individual or $500,000 per couple then you would be required to pay the additional 3.8 percent tax on any gain realized over this threshold. Most people who sell their homes will not be impacted by these new regulations. This is not a new tax on every seller, and that correction needs to be made. This tax is aimed at so-called \"high earners\"  if you do not fall into that category you will not pay any extra taxes upon the sale of your home.\n For example, let's assume that a couple with an income of $325,000 bought a house in 2004 for $300,000 and resold it in 2013 for $850,000, thus producing a $550,000 profit.  Since U.S. law allows a couple to exclude from their gross income\nprofits of up to $500,000 from the sale of their principal residence, the taxable gain from this sale would be $50,000 (i.e., a $550,000 profit minus the $500,000 exclusion), and the couple's taxable income would now be $375,000 (i.e., the original $325,000 plus the $50,000 of taxable profit from their home sale).   The 3.8% Medicare tax would now apply to whichever of the following dollar figures is the lesser: exclude \n a)  The amount by which the couple's taxable income now exceeds the $250,000 income threshold level.  b)  The amount of taxable income gained from the sale of their home.\n In case (a), the dollar figure  would be the couple's taxable income ($375,000) minus the income threshold level ($250,000), or $125,000. In case (b), the dollar figure would be amount of taxable income gained from the sale of their home, which, as detailed above, was $50,000 (i.e., $550,000 profit minus the $500,000 exclusion).   The second dollar amount is the lesser of the two, and therefore the couple would have to pay an additional tax of 3.8 percent of $50,000, which would amount to $1,900.  (If the hypothetical couple had realized less than a $500,000 profit on the sale of their residence, none of that gain would be subject to the 3.8% tax.) The referenced tax is therefore not a tax on all real estate sales; it is an investment income tax which could result in a very small percentage of home sellers paying additional taxes on home sales profits over a designated threshold amount.   In short, if you're a \"high earner\" and you sell your home at a substantial profit, you might be required to pay an additional 3.8% tax. However, given that only about 3% of U.S. households have incomes that exceed the specified income threshold amount, the existing home sale capital gains exclusion on a principal residence ($250,000 for individuals, $500,000 for couples) still stands, and the national median existing-home price in January 2012 was only $154,700 , the Medicare tax will likely affect only a very small percentage of home sellers when it is implemented in 2013. median Additional information:  \n\n    The 3.8% Tax:\nReal Estate Scenarios & Examples\n\n\n  The 3.8% Tax:\nReal Estate Scenarios & Examples Last updated:  15 March 2012\n    Sahadi, Jeanne.  \"Medicare Tax Hikes: What the Rich Will Pay.\"\n   CNNMoney.com.  25 March 2010.\n",

        "justification": "Claim:  Photograph shows a \"Welcome to Kenya\" sign identifying that country as the birthplace of Barack Obama. FALSE Examples:  [Collected via e-mail, February 2010] \nSign posted on the road just outside Nairobi, Kenya: \n \n Origins:  The image displayed above is one of the more humorous riffs on the \"birther\" conspiracy that holds Barack Obama was born in Kenya (not Hawaii) and therefore does not qualify for natural-born citizen status in the U.S. (and hence is ineligible to hold the office of President).  The photograph purportedly depicts a sign displayed somewhere near the Kenyan capital city of Nairobi which welcomes visitors (in both English and Arabic script) to that country by touting it as the birthplace of Barack Obama.   Some commentators were skeptical of this image for reasons such as the purported sign's not matching other similar \"Welcome\" signs displayed in the Republic of Kenya, like the following (which is differently colored and uses Roman alphabet block lettering throughout): \n\n Other giveaways are that (as shown in the image immediately above), Kenya's national language, Swahili, is typically written using the Roman alphabet, not Arabic script, and that the Arabic text displayed on the purported sign is not the equivalent of the English phrases rendered in any language common to the area.  (Readers who understand the non-English writing have told us that although it is malformed  the letters are disconnected and the words are spelled backwards  the word under \"Kenya\" is actually Arabic for \"Hawaii,\" the message at the bottom of the sign says \"Not the birthplace of Barack Obama,\" and the script under the \"Welcome to\" legend is the equivalent of \"Paul is dead.\") Language issues aside, the image demonstrably is a fake; a digitally altered version of a sign welcoming visitors to a very different part of the world: the Omani territory of Wilayat Madha (along the border between Oman and the United Arab Emirates).

        "justification": "On 5 March 2018, conspiracy blog Your News Wire published an article warning about the alleged \"Islamization\" of London, claiming that the city had closed 500 churches  and opened 423 new mosques: article The creeping Islamization of London is almost complete, with hundreds of official sharia courts operating in the capital, and mosques opening where famous Christian churches have stood for many hundreds of years. London is more Islamic than many Muslim countries put together, according to Maulana Syed Raza Rizvi, one of the Islamic preachers who now lead Londonistan, as the journalist Melanie Phillips has called the English capital. No, Rizvi is not a right-wing extremist. The Your News Wire piece was based on an April 2017 post by the Gatestone Institute, a right-wing think tank that used extremist language to describe an alleged Muslim takeover of London. (We employ the term \"based\" lightly here, as Your News Wire simply wrote a few of their own fear-mongering paragraphs before producing a near-verbatim copy of the Gatestone post.) In their piece, Gatestone offered shoddy research and cherry-picked data  including the claim that London is home to 423 \"new\" mosques and that 500 of the city's churches have closed since 2001. post For their \"new\" mosque claim, Gatestone used a map of mosques in London from MuslimsInBritain.org, a blog dedicated to cataloging British mosques. Yet the map itself didn't claim to be a catalog of \"new\" mosques, and a number of mosques included on the map were built well before the year 2000. The Finsbury Park Mosque, for instance, was constructed in the 1990s, and the Leytonstone Mosque in 1976. MuslimsInBritain.org Finsbury Park Mosque Leytonstone Mosque While Your News Wire and Gatestone both sought to create the impression that large cathedral-like mosques are being \"built on the ruins of Christianity,\" many British mosques are small communities that meet in converted houses or buildings. According to MuslimsInBritain.org, the majority of mosques in the United Kingdom are small establishments with fewer than 300 members. establishments A 2012 report in ArchitectsJournal.com also noted that the majority of mosques in Britain are not purpose-built structures: \"There is no definitive figure for how many mosques there are in Britain today, although the best estimate is in the region of 1,500. Of these, approximately 200 are purpose-built, the rest being either converted houses or other non-residential conversions.\" ArchitectsJournal.com Gatestone's claim that 500 churches had closed since 2001 was also based on shoddy research. The number came from a 2012 Wall Street Journal article about a British trend of converting old churches into private homes: Wall Street Journal Although it's still relatively rare in the U.S., the adaptive reuse of churches has become a popular practice in other countries, like the U.K. In 2006, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors found that since 2001, about 500 churches in London alone had been converted into homes. In other countries, such as Germany and Russia, people still regard the concept of living in a church as disrespectful, says Bart Kellerhuis of Utrecht-based firm Zecc Architects, which has done several church-to-home conversions in the Netherlands. However, what the article did not state was when these churches had actually closed, meaning that some of the converted churches may have closed prior to 2001. The figure also excluded any churches that had closed since 2001 and were not converted into houses. The figure also didn't account for how many churches in London had opened their doors since 2001. Dr. Peter Brierley, a leading expert on British religious statistics and author of the report UK Church Statistics, found that London saw the opening of 700 new churches between 2005 and 2012, and that the total number of churches in the United Kingdom actually increased between 2008 and 2013: Dr. Peter Brierley churches \n  While the overall numbers are only changing slowly, the actual number of churches increased between 2008 and 2013 and is expected to continue between 2013 and 2020. Why is this? The answer comes in two broad ways. There are 600 more Pentecostal churches in the UK than 5 years ago, the large majority being new black churches, of which the RCCOG is the largest denomination. The Black Majority Churches [BMCs] explosion has been significant, especially in Greater London where of the 700 new churches which began between 2005 and 2012, at least 400 were BMCs. The Redeemed Christian Church of God [RCCOG] alone has started 296 new churches in the UK in the last 5 years, the largest number for any single denomination. Bierley predicted that there would be 40,080 churches in England by 2020. The Your News Wire article was meant to inflame fears that Muslims in London are starting to outnumber Christians, and that Christians (or their culture) will soon be displaced  but thanks to poor research and cherry-picked numbers, it provided a false impression of Britain's current reality.

        "justification": "FACT CHECK:  Does a photograph show a dog who saved the life of an abandoned newborn child?  Claim:  Photograph shows a dog who saved the life of an abandoned newborn child.   MIXTURE WHAT'S TRUE:   Various international news accounts published between 2005 and 2013 have reported dogs rescuing abandoned newborn babies.      WHAT'S FALSE:  The photograph shown above is connected to any of those news reports. Example:  [Collected via e-mail, July 2015] I saw this ridiculous report on my news feed on Facebook. \"A newborn baby abandoned in a forest was saved by a stray dog who carried her across a busy road and through a barbed wire fence to a shed where the infant was discovered nestled with her litter of puppies.  Covered by CNN and CBS. Definitely a mans best friend.\" How did they know the dog carried her across a busy road if they had first discovered the infant in the shed?  Who would stand there and wait for dog to get the baby to the shed? Origins: On 28 March 2014, the web site of Albuquerque FM radio station KOB published the image shown below to their Facebook wall (an image that had previously been shared by South Carolina country music station WUBB): published WUBB Although both iterations of this meme amassed hundreds of thousands of shares each, the claim associated with the images of a dog and a sleeping newborn was not new, was of uncertain validity, and did not originate in the U.S. images The popular image associated with the circulated meme is a stock photograph which is completely unrelated to any news story and does not depict a hero dog and a baby rescued by it. stock photograph The incident referenced in the meme is presumably one relayed in a news story about a canine rescue of a newborn child in Kenya that was reported by the Associated Press and CBS in May 2005: Associated Press   A nursing dog foraging for food retrieved an abandoned baby girl in a forest in Kenya and carried the infant to its litter of puppies, witnesses said. The stray dog carried the infant across a busy road and through a barbed wire fence in a poor neighborhood near the Ngong Forest in the capital, Nairobi, Stephen Thoya told the independent Daily Nation newspaper. The dog apparently found the baby in the plastic bag in which the infant had been abandoned, said Aggrey Mwalimu, owner of the compound where the animal is now living. It was unclear how the baby survived in the bag without suffocating. Curiously, the dog pictured in the 2005 Kenyan rescue story seemingly popped up in a nearly identical 2008 CNN account of a canine's saving an abandoned child half a world away in Argentina: Kenyan Argentina   A dog sheltered a newborn baby abandoned by its 14-year-old mother in a field in rural Argentina until the boy was rescued, a doctor said. A resident of a rural area outside La Plata called police to say that he had heard the baby crying in a field behind his house. The man went outside and found the infant lying beside the dog and its six newborn puppies, said Daniel Salcedo, chief of police of the Province of Buenos Aires. The dog had apparently carried the baby 50 meters from where his mother had abandoned him to where the puppies were huddled, police said.   Similar incidents, all involving dogs locating abandoned babies and alerting humans to their presence (thereby facilitating the nick-of-time rescue of those infants), were reported as having taken place in Ghana in 2012: Ghana   A farm dog in Ghana has attained hero status after spending a night protecting an abandoned newborn human. Authorities say the dog, along with its two-week-old charge, was found under a bridge in Winkongo (which is near Bolgatanga, the Upper East Regional Capital of Ghana), near the farm where he lives  with the tiny baby snuggled against him. A search party had been convened to look for the dog, not the baby, when the pooch's worried owner got concerned that her pet hadn't returned home in the evening. Searchers spent most of the night tracking the hound through nearby fields and woods, and came upon the unlikely pair quite some time later; finally locating him under the bridge near the farm he calls home, they were surprised to find the dog curled around a human infant.   And in the UK in 2013: UK   A newborn baby, abandoned inside a plastic carrier bag and hidden in bushes, was sniffed out by a friendly Alsatian roaming parkland. Inquisitive pet Jade alerted her owner by scampering excitedly around undergrowth in a far corner of Stechfords Marlborough House Community Park. And when he went to inspect, the stunned walker discovered the six-pound baby girl, swathed in blue toweling and concealed in a toy shop bag. She is thought to be only a day old and her umbilical cord was still attached.   Last updated: 27 July 2015 Originally published:  27 July 2015",

        "justification": "Claim:  List details a \"trifecta\" of firsts related to President Obama. FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, January 2010] \nPresident Obama just completed the UNHOLY and ANTI-AMERICAN TRIFECTA:  1st president in 110 years to miss the annual Army-Navy Football Game. 1st president to not attend any Christmas religious observance. 1st president to stay on vacation after a terrorist attack.\n Origins:  The above-cited list of three \"unholy\" and \"anti-American\" firsts supposedly achieved by President Barack Obama began circulating in January 2010.  Although the entries reference events that did take place, none of them is, as claimed, a first for a U.S. president: 1st president in 110 years to miss the annual Army-Navy Football Game The rivalry between the Army and Navy football teams is one that has endured for over a century, with the teams annually facing off on the gridiron in a contest that bears the nickname of the \"President's Game.\"   In 1901 Theodore Roosevelt became the first U.S. president to attend an Army-Navy football game, and throughout the years since then, many chief executives have been in the stands to witness the yearly matchup.  On 12 December 2009, Navy beat Army, 17-3, for the Midshipmen's eighth straight win in the series.  President Obama was not among those in attendance at the game. The statement above, which claims that President Barack Obama was \"the 1st president in 110 years to miss the annual Army-Navy Football Game,\" implies that every single president since Theodore Roosevelt attended the Army-Navy game each year they were in office.  This is far from the case:  Many presidents took in only one or two Army-Navy games, and several attended none at all.  As charted in the sidenotes of a history of the Army-Navy game compiled by the Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies, presidents such as Herbert Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush were not present for any Army-Navy football games throughout their terms of office.\n \n history 1st president to not attend any Christmas religious observance. The Christian Post did report that a trip to church was \"missing from the president's schedule\" during President Obama's holiday vacation in Hawaii at Christmastime 2009.  However, he was far from the first president for whom that was the case.  Accurately determining who was the very first president \"to not attend any Christmas religious observance\" would probably be an impossible task since detailed, day-to-day accounts of every president's activities throughout the 220-year history of the U.S. presidency do not exist, but (if the term \"Christmas religious observance\" is defined to mean a service held at a church on Christmas Day) several earlier examples of presidents' not taking part in such an event over the years can be found in contemporaneous press accounts.  For example: report \n In 1972, President Richard Nixon passed the Christmas holiday season with a week-long stay at the \"Florida White House\" (a property in Key Biscayne which he owned and visited frequently), during which the press reported that he \"did not attend church services\" and that \"a single night out with Mrs. Nixon and a neighbor, C. G. 'Bebe' Rebozo, was the President's only public appearance.\"  In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson (who was recovering from the flu) spent a \"quiet and nostalgic Christmas with relatives and friends\" at home, with the press noting that although the President was a \"devoted ecumenical church goer,\" he nonetheless \"skipped church services\" and did not venture outside the White House.  In 1929 (just after a fire had damaged the interior of the White House executive offices), President Herbert Hoover spent \"Christmas at home with friends,\" with press accounts stating that the President and Mrs. Hoover \"did not attend church, as their own church did not hold services.\"  In 1914 (as the \"shadow of the European war darkened the celebration of the day\"), President Woodrow Wilson distributed presents to his grandniece and Treasury secretary William McAdoo's daughter and hosted a Christmas party at the White House, but the press observed that \"the President did not attend church services today, although other members of the White House circle did.\"  In 1905, according to an Associated Press account, President Theodore Roosevelt appeared at his office on Christmas Day \"just long enough to dispose of a few matters of importance that required his attention\" but \"did not attend church service,\" instead spending the day at the White House with \"his family and intimate personal friends\" and hosting a family dinner.\n  1st president to stay on vacation after a terrorist attack. On Christmas Day 2009, a Nigerian man claimed to have ties to Al Qaeda attempted to set off an explosive he had smuggled onto Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit.  (His effort failed when the device malfunctioned.)  President Obama had departed Washington on Christmas Eve to spend the holidays with his family in Hawaii and did not return to the capital until January 3, so in a strictly literal sense he could be described as having been \"on vacation after a terrorist attack.\"  In a broader sense, though, for U.S. presidents of the modern era being \"on vacation\" generally means that they're away from the White House but never completely away from the duties of their office.  Even though President Obama was in Hawaii rather than Washington when the failed attack occurred, he was nonetheless engaged in  dealing with it, taking part in multiple security briefings about the incident, ordering reviews of airline screening procedures and U.S. intelligence, and undertaking a televised address to the nation. briefings reviews address In any case, President Obama doesn't qualify for a first here, either, as the circumstances of December 2009 mirrored those of eight years earlier.  On 22 December 2001, President George W. Bush left the White House for the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland around midday to begin his Christmastime vacation, and later that afternoon Richard Reid (infamously known as the \"shoe bomber\") unsuccessfully attempted to detonate plastic explosives he had smuggled  in his shoes onto American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami.  President Bush remained at Camp David (where he received briefings on the bombing attempt) through Christmas Day, then flew to the family ranch in Crawford, Texas, and didn't return to Washington until 7 January 2002. A later variant of this piece added a fourth claim to the \"trifecta\" listed in the original: \n\nAdd to that, he's the first President not to stay in Washington for Christmas for the last 20 years. Past Presidents did not leave Washington for Christmas vacation until after Christmas. This was done so that their staff (Secret Service, Air Force One Crew, Limousine transport, Presidential advancing logistics etc..) could be with their families for Christmas.\n\n This claim is also false.  As noted above, in 2001 President George W. Bush departed Washington three days prior to Christmas and did not return to the city until after the beginning of the new year.

Online access would be suspended in at least 14 of 22 districts in Haryana state near New Delhi, until 5 p.m. Monday, according to the Department of Information and Public Relations of Haryana on Sunday. That order was first imposed Tuesday in three Haryana districts for 24 hours, but has been extended every day since. [...] The internet restrictions came after violent scenes last week as demonstrations continue against three agricultural laws passed in September. Since late November, hundreds of thousands of protesters have gathered on the outskirts of New Delhi to demonstrate against changes they say they weren't consulted on and which will hurt their livelihoods. The News International, an English-language Pakistani newspaper, noted that people who express criticism of India's government are often accused of being connected in some manner to Pakistan: accused Indian trolls have started taking aim at Barbados singer Rihanna after she tweeted on the farmers protest, urging people to start a conversation about her. Some Pakistanis on Twitter took the opportunity to craft witty memes that take aim at India's Pakistan-phobia anytime something happens in their country.  ",

            "The lesson of the \"Mystery of the Man from Taured\" is that one should not attribute to extra-dimensional beings what can be explained by ordinary fraud."
        ],
        "justification": "Common classes of paranormal tales are accounts of persons who have mysteriously appeared (e.g., from the past, the future, other worlds, other dimensions) and those who have mysteriously vanished (to no one knows where).  One example of this genre that has proved popular over the last few decades. the \"Mystery of the Man from Taured,\" involves both of these elements:  The report of the man \"from a parallel universe\" who inexplicably showed up at a Tokyo airport in 1954 bearing a passport from the nonexistent country of \"Taured\" and then just as bafflingly disappeared from police custody is typically related in a number of mostly similar variant forms, such as the following account of the supposed mystery man from Taured: \nIts July 1954; a hot day. A man arrives at Tokyo airport in Japan. Hes of Caucasian appearance and conventional-looking. But the officials are suspicious. On checking his passport, they see that he hails from a country called Taured. The passport looked genuine, except for the fact that there is no such country as Taured  well, at least in our dimension. The man is interrogated, and asked to point out where his country supposedly exists on a map. He immediately points his finger towards the Principality of Andorra, but becomes angry and confused. Hes never heard of Andorra, and cant understand why his homeland of Taured isnt there. According to him it should have been, for it had existed for more than 1,000 years! Customs officials found him in possession of money from several different European currencies. His passport had been stamped by many airports around the globe, including previous visits to Tokyo. Baffled, they took him to a local hotel and placed him in a room with two guards outside until they could get to the bottom of the mystery. The company he claimed to work for had no knowledge of him, although he had copious amounts of documentation to prove his point. The hotel he claimed to have a reservation for had never heard of him either. The company officials in Tokyo he was there to do business with? Yup, youve guessed it  they just shook their heads too. Later, when the hotel room he was held in was opened, the man had disappeared. The police established that he could not have escaped out of the window  the room was several floors up, and there was no balcony.  He was never seen again, and the mystery was never solved.\n This story seems to be one that was inspired by a real-life incident, but its modern form is a greatly embellished and fantastical version of the far less sensational real story. A debate in the British House of Commons on July 29, 1960, on the subject of frontier formalities (i.e., the administrative process by which a person enters the territory of another country) included mention of a man named John Alan Zegrus, who was then being prosecuted in Japan for using a false passport: debate in the British House of Commons \nMy hon. Friend may know the case of John Alan Zegrus, who is at present being prosecuted in Tokyo. In evidence, he describes himself as an intelligence agent for Colonel Nasser and a naturalized Ethiopian. This man, according to the evidence, has travelled all over the world with a very impressive looking passport indeed. It is written in a language unknown and it has remained un-identified although it has been studied for a long time by philologists. The passport is stated to have been issued in Tamanrosset, the capital of the independent sovereign State of Tuarid. Neither the country nor the language can be identified, although a great deal of time has been spent in the attempt. When the accused was cross-examined he said that it was a state of 2 million population somewhere south of the Sahara. This man has been round the world on this passport without hindrance, a passport which as far as we know is written in the invented language of an invented country. I would stress, therefore, that passports are not very good security checks.\n As unusual as this account may seem in our modern security-conscious era -- that a man had been successful in moving about the world using a fabricated passport issued by a made-up country and bearing writing in a nonsensical language -- it was borne out by contemporaneous reporting, such as the following August 1960 newspaper article: newspaper article \nEveryone who has run into officialdom to his cost and wondered at the ridiculous questions asked of tourists will have sympathy for a man sonorously named John Allen Kuchar Zegrus. Mr. Zegrus wanted to travel round the world. To impress officials, he invented a nation, a capital, a people and a language. All these he recorded on a passport which he made himself. Victims of bureaucracy all over the universe will be delighted to hear that he was wonderfully received everywhere -- well, almost everywhere. John claimed to be a naturalized Ethiopian and an intelligence agent for Colonel Nasser. The passport was stamped as issued at Tamanrasset, the capital of Tuared south of the Sahara. Any places so romantically named ought to exist, but they dont. John Allen Kuchar Zegrus invented them. Armed with this wonderful document, Mr. Zegrus travelled royally through the Middle East, accepting homage as he went. And if there were any doubters, they were invited to read a kind of proclamation beneath the national Tuared stamp. It read: \"Rch ubwaii ochtra negussi habessi trwap turapa.\" That was the clincher, but didnt mean anything in any language. The gallant gesture for the individualist, unfortunately, ended with the Japanese in Tokyo. They began looking up maps. John Allen is in court, a martyr to Japanese thoroughness. His action takes precedence, we think, over the American citizen who flew his own plane round the world wearing his own uniform, receiving homage from all and sundry. But the more we ponder on Mr. Zegrus, the more we wish there were really a capital called Tamanrasset, in the delectable county of Tuared south of the Sahara, with a language like the one Zegrus invented. All its citizens would be blessed with John Allens sterling attitude towards collectors of useless information.\n A summary of a Japanese radio broadcast from December 1961 suggested that Zegrus had not only been making use of a phony passport, but he had also been passing bad checks and claiming to be an agent of both the FBI and CIA: summary of a Japanese radio broadcast \nThe Tokyo District Court 22 December [1961] sentenced John Allen K. Zegrus, a man without nationality, to one year imprisonment for having illegally entered Japan and passing phony checks. Zegrus, self-styled American who has professedly acted as an agent for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, entered this country in 1959 on a bogus passport.\n A user with the screen name of taraiochi located and posted some Japanese newspaper articles from 1960-61 about the mystery man from Taured, who had entered Japan from Taiwan along with his Korean wife using an obviously fake passport and was arrested after cashing forged checks to cover the cost of his stay there: taraiochi Japanese newspaper articles \nYomiuri Shimbun\n10 August 1960 The \"Mystery Man\" Who Tried to Smuggle Himself Into the Country Attempted suicide immediately after sentencing Fictitious nationality, fluent in 14 languages A mysterious foreigner of unknown nationality and background, accused of illegal entry and fraud, tried to commit suicide in front of the judge who handed down his verdict at the Tokyo District Court on April 10. The defendant, John Allen K. Zegrus (36), was sentenced by Judge Yamagishi to one year of imprisonment at his sentencing hearing in Tokyo District Court, but when the interpreter informed him of his sentence, the defendant suddenly stood up and slashed his arms with pieces of a broken glass bottle that he had hidden in his mouth. As Ziegler shouted \"I'm going to kill myself,\" three guards rushed to restrain him, and he was taken by ambulance to Kyobashi Hospital. Zegrus and his Korean wife entered Haneda Airport from Taipei using a forged passport on October 24 last year, but by December he was having trouble paying for his stay and cashed about 200,000 worth of counterfeit checks at Tokyo banks.  The forged passport Zegrus used to enter the country was handmade, and the name of the country it bore, Negusi Habesi Ghouloulouloul Esprit, was completely fictitious. The nature of the text on the passport was also unclear, defying attempts of a linguistic specialist to identify the language it was written in. The defendant, said to be fluent in 14 languages, told investigators that he had come to Japan on orders from an Arab-related organization and was working for a U.S. intelligence agency, but these claims were not true. The district prosecutor was hampered by the fact that the true identity and nationality of the defendant was unknown, and this mystery was not cleared up at trial. The passport Zegrus used was the size of a weekly magazine and was recognizable at a glance as a fake, but nonetheless the Japanese Embassy in Taipei had issued him a visa on October 17 last year, and this was the first time the defendant had entered Japan using that passport.   The defendant's wife, 30, entered the country with him and was repatriated to South Korea on her own passport.\n Additional articles suggested Zegrus was eventually released on time served and left Japan vowing to embark upon a \"new life in a new country,\" the enigma of who he really was and where he came from unresolved (and his ultimate fate unknown). Over the years, this instance of an unusual but explicable fraudster -- whose story did not require the existence of additional dimensions or defy our understanding of time and space -- came to be adorned with additional contrived details (e.g., the subject's agitation over not being able to locate on a modern map a country that \"had existed for more than 1,000 years\" where Andorra is now; his unfathomable disappearance from a guarded hotel room) that transformed it from a real-life criminal immigration/fraud case into a fictional tale of a mysteriously vanished visitor from another dimension.   Although variations in orthography and spelling in different accounts of Zegrus' exploits make matters even more confusing, we note that Tamanrasset is the name of a province and city in Algeria, and Tuareg is the name of a group of people and languages in and around the country of Algeria, it's possible Zegrus hailed from (or claimed to hail from) that region of the world.  Regardless of his precise origins, the \"mystery man from Taured\" was definitely neither an extraterrestrial nor an interdimensional, time-traveling being. Tamanrasset Tuareg",

As reported on the South African web site 2oceansvibe.com (2ov), the confrontation captured on the video took place in Bloemfontein, the capital city of the Free State Province of South Africa, in early March 2012, and the driver was arrested the following day: reported \n\nYusuf Abramjee, Head of News and Current Affairs at Primedia Broadcasting, and chairperson of the National Press Club, told 2ov that the taxi driver has been arrested: \"It happened on Friday [2 March 2012]. The driver was arrested on Saturday. The victim is a homeless man who has not opened a charge. It happened in Bloemfontein outside a filling station. When I was alerted yesterday about this, Lead SA alerted the Ministry of Transport who got the Road Traffic Management Corporation to also probe it. I've just been told by the National Prosecuting Authority they are also following up to see the status of the case. The worrying part is the Public who stand alongside doing nothing. That's why the Lead SA philosophy of creating an active civic society is what we need.\"\n \n\n\n\n  Last updated:  24 February 2015\n ",

RUINS OF ANCIENT CITY DISCOVERED IN AUSTRALIAN DESERT\n Origins:  On 7 September 2014, the World News Daily Report web site published an article positing that the remains of a hitherto unknown ancient city had been discovered in the Australian desert: article \n\nA team of archaeologists working for the Australian National University, who were proceeding to an excavation near the sandstone rock formation of Uluru, has unearthed the ruins of a large precolonial city dating back to more than 1500 years ago. The important number of tombs and artifacts already discovered on the site suggests that it could have been the capital of an ancient empire, completely unknown to historians until now. Professor Walter Reese, in charge of the site, claims that the extent of the site and the superposition of various layers of constructions, suggests that it was occupied for 400 to 500 years, from approximately 470-80 AD, up until the 9th Century. He believes that the city could have held between 20000 and 30000 inhabitants, making it the most important center of civilization in the Southern Pacific at the time.\n Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this item were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered it mistaking it for a genuine news article.

Just be thankful you're not in China, where a traffic jam stretching more than 100 km (62 miles) has forced drivers to keep their feet planted on brake pedals for nine days. The gridlock, which started August 14, involves thousands of trucks between the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Chinese capital of Beijing, according to state media. Fender-benders and broken-down vehicles are adding to the chaos, state media reported. Some drivers played cards to pass the time, while others fumed about nearby vendors taking advantage of their predicament by gouging food prices. Still, some opted to not take detours to avoid farther travel and toll costs. Traffic congestion is a common problem in China. But construction on a section of the Beijing-Tibet Expressway has forced more traffic onto National Expressway 110, which runs roughly parallel.

A Boeing 757 and a fleet of armored cars for Michelle's sight seeing tour! Michelle One On Sunday, President Obama flew back to the United States on Air Force One. His wife, two daughters and her mother did a bit of shopping in Paris before taking their own Boeing 757 (C-32) over to London to do some sight seeing. We all remember Obama's admonishment to corporate CEO's in February: \"You can't get corporate jets, you can't go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayers dime.\" Apparently that doesn't apply to his wife. The London Times opened it's description of Michelle's visit this way: Motorcycle outriders, armoured Chevrolets and bullet-headed men in raincoats criss-crossed London yesterday as Michelle Obama and her daughters spent a second day on an unofficial visit to the capital. The Times went on to describe that when Michelle and the girls arrived at Westminster Abbey, the building was closed to tourists with people already in told to \"wait against  the wall..\" An American visiting the Abbey said \"Right then I knew it was probably someone from our 'royal family'.\" Michelle's motorcade shut down the London street above as the First Lady of the World and her children go for Fish and Chips at a pub in Mayfair. The entourage inside the restaurant was 15 people while dozens more wait outside. Include the dozens of Air Force personnel to fly and service the plane, embassy personnel and other staff and we are talking about a serious expenditure of tax payer dollars. Meanwhile, millions of Americans have lost their jobs and won't be able to take their family on a summer holiday. Despite their circumstances they'll still be expected to fork over the tax dollars to pay for Michelle's trip. Tell your friends about this  it's their money being spent!!\n Origins:  On 7 June 2009, at the end of a six-day trip abroad that began in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, went to Egypt and Germany, and concluded in France to mark the 65th anniversary of D-Day, President Obama flew back to the U.S. He had been joined in France on 5 June for that portion of the trip by his wife and two children. They did not return to the U.S. with him but instead continued to London for a two-day holiday in that city. Michelle Obama and the couple's two daughters flew to Stansted airport in Essex on 8 June 2009  in a U.S. Air Force C-32 (Boeing 757) airliner. From there, they were escorted to London by secret service agents. They returned to the U.S. on 11 June 2009. While in London, Mrs. Obama had tea with Sarah Brown, wife of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, at Downing Street. She and the two girls toured the sights of Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, and Westminster Abbey, went shopping in Central London, ate at a pub in Mayfair, and attended The Lion King musical at the Lyceum Theatre in London's West End. They also visited Pinewood Studios to meet the stars of the Harry Potter films and author J.K. Rowling, then held a birthday party for the Obamas' youngest child, Sasha, on the Hogwart's Great Hall set. Regarding who would be footing the bill for the trip, the Washington Post reported that: \n\nWith some people questioning who paid for the family trip, the White House emphasized that the Obamas' tour was a strictly private visit. \"The Obamas are committed to following all the relevant rules and regulations regarding the reimbursement of travel expenses,\" said the first lady's spokeswoman Semonti Mustaphi.\n (We note that \"following all the relevant rules and regulations regarding the reimbursement of travel expenses\" may involve something on the order of paying an amount equivalent to the cost of commercial transportation, not necessarily reimbursing the government for the total expenditures incurred in association with the trip.)

        "justification": "Claim:  Item cites religious references related to George Washington and the Washington Monument. Status:  Multiple  see below. Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2002] \n\n\nWashington continues to Give Praise to God On the aluminum cap atop the Washington Monument in Washington, DC are two words: Laus Deo. No one can see these words. In fact, most visitors to the monument have no idea they are even there and...for that matter...probably couldn't  care less! But there they are...5.125 inches high ... perched atop the monument to the father of our nation. The Washington Monument is 55 feet wide at the base and 555 feet tall, overlooking the 69 square miles which comprise the District of Columbia, capital of the United States of America.  It is made of 36,000 stones of marble (from Maryland) and granite (from Maine) and weighs 90,000 tons.  The monument sees about 800,000 visitors a year. Laus Deo! Two seemingly insignificant, unnoticed words ... out of sight and, one might think, out of mind ... but very meaningfully placed at the highest point over what is the most powerful city in the world.  And what might those two words ... composed of just four syllables and only seven letters ... mean?  Very simply ... \"Praise be to God!\" Though construction of this giant obelisk began in 1848 when James Polk was President of the United States, it was not until 1888 that the monument was inaugurated and opened to the public. It took twenty-five\nyears to finally cap the memorial with the tribute Laus Deo! Praise be to God! From atop this magnificent granite and marble structure ... a visitor can take in the beautiful panoramic view of the city with its division into four major segments. And from that vantage point one can also easily see the original plan of the designer, Pierre Charles l'Enfant ... a perfect cross imposed upon the landscape ... with the White House to the North, the Jefferson Memorial to the South, the Capitol to the East, and the Lincoln Memorial to the West. A cross ... you say? How interesting! And ... no doubt ... intended to carry a meaning for those who bother to notice. Praise be to God! One interesting feature is the interior iron stairway with 50 landings and 897 stone steps. These donated stones come from every state in the Union, as well as Native American nations and foreign countries. While the stairwell has been closed since the 1970s, visitors can gain access to the top observation area via elevator.  As one climbs the steps and pauses at the landings the memorial stones share a message. On the 12th Landing is a prayer offered by the City of Baltimore; on the 20th is a memorial presented by some Chinese Christians; on the 24th a presentation made by Sunday School children from New York and Philadelphia quoting Proverbs 10:7, Luke 18:16 and Proverbs 22:6. Praise be to God! When the cornerstone of the Washington Monument was laid on July 4th, 1848 deposited within it were many items including the Holy Bible presented by the Bible Society. Praise be to God! Such was the discipline, the moral direction, the spiritual mood given by the founder and first President of our unique democracy .. \"one nation, under God.\" I am awed by Washington's prayer for America. Have you never read it? Well now is your opportunity ... read on! \"Almighty God; We make our earnest prayer that Thou wilt keep the United States in Thy holy protection; that Thou wilt incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to\ngovernment; and entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another and for their fellow citizens of the United states at large. And finally that Thou wilt most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice,\nto love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind which were the characteristics of the Divine Author of our blessed religion, and without a humble imitation of whose example in these things we can never hope to be a happy nation. Grant our supplication, we beseech Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\" Laus Deo! As you might have guessed ... I kind of like the idea that our Pledge of Allegiance includes the phrase \"under God.\" It is clear when one studies the history of our great nation that Washington's America was one of the few countries in all the world established under the guidance, direction and banner of Almighty God, to whom was given all praise, honor and worship by the great men who formed and fashioned her pivotal foundations. And when one stops to observe the inscriptions found in public places all over our nation's capitol ... one will easily find the signature of God. We are a nation under God!!!  Laus Deo!!! Praise be to God!!!\n Origins:   This item contains a good deal of information about the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., but since most of the interest in this piece seems to be about the religious references cited, we'll focus on that aspect here.   \n\nOn the aluminum cap atop the Washington Monument in Washington, DC are two words: Laus Deo.\n\n  It is true that the words \"Laus Deo\" are inscribed on one face of the aluminum point which crowns the apex of the Washington Monument.  Actually, all four sides of the point bear inscriptions, as follows: \n\n(NORTH FACE.)\nJOINT COMMISSION\nAT\nSETTING OF CAPSTONE.\nCHESTER A. ARTHUR.\nW. W. CORCORAN, Chairman.\nM. E.

LAUS DEO.  \n\n And from that vantage point one can also easily see the original plan of the designer, Pierre Charles l'Enfant ... a perfect cross imposed upon the landscape ... with the White House to the North, the Jefferson Memorial to the South, the Capitol to the East, and the Lincoln Memorial to the West. A cross ... you say?\n\n As described by the National Park Service, architect Pierre Charles L'Enfant's original 1791 plan for the U.S. national capital was: plan \n\n[A] Baroque plan that features ceremonial spaces and grand radial avenues, while respecting natural contours of the land. The result was a system of intersecting diagonal avenues superimposed over a grid system. The avenues radiated from the two most significant building sites that were to be occupied by houses for Congress and the President.  L'Enfant specified in notes accompanying the plan that these avenues were to be wide, grand, lined with trees, and situated in a manner that   would visually connect ideal topographical sites throughout the city, where important structures, monuments, and fountains were to be erected. On paper, L'Enfant shaded and numbered 15 large open spaces at the intersections of these avenues and indicated that they would be divided among the states. He specified that each reservation would feature statues and memorials to honor worthy citizens.\n Where the north-south axis of the White House and the east-west axis of the Capitol intersect (see map), L'Enfant intended to put an equestrian statue of George Washington.  The Washington Monument was later erected in place of the equestrian statue, although poor soil conditions made it necessary to construct the monument slightly out of alignment with the intersection of the axes: map \n\nIn 1848, sixty-four years after Congress had made the first proposal for a memorial to the first President, it granted a 37-acre site for it to the Washington National Monument Society. It was the same site, Reservation No. 2, on which L'Enfant had planned the [equestrian] memorial. Soil tests, however, showed the intended spot due south of the White House and due West of the Capital to be too marshy. A site about 100 yards to the southeast was chosen, thus altering both the monument's north-south alignment with the White House and its east-west alignment with the Capitol.\n\n (The proposed equestrian statue of Washington was not completed until 1860 and was placed near the present location of George Washington University.) statue While L'Enfant's plans did eventually create a \"cross\" in a literal sense, that shape was a byproduct of a symmetrical design laid out along two major north-south and east-west axes; there's no evidence that L'Enfant had any religious significance in mind.  Moreover, the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials were not conceived until the 20th century, and decisions about where to locate them were not reached without some debate.   As the Park Service notes of the Lincoln Memorial: Lincoln \n\nTalk of a memorial began soon after Lincoln's death, but it was years before construction began. While an early design was made, there was no financial support behind it. The project stopped momentarily, but the idea did not fade away. Members of Congress kept the dream live. By February, 1911, a bill was passed establishing the Lincoln Memorial Commission. Two million dollars was set aside for the memorial. With such solid backing, the Lincoln Memorial would finally get started.  The next critical issue facing the committee was the location for the new memorial. At one time, an idea was discussed that a memorial highway should link Washington with Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The bill, however, determined that [the memorial] would be in Washington, D.C. Many locations were discussed within the city. One suggestion was Potomac Park, newly created as a result of filling in the swampy area along the Potomac River. Although it was hard to imagine this as an ideal setting for a new memorial, some saw the potential. This Lincoln Memorial would be the perfect addition to Pierre L'Enfant's plan for the capital city, serving as the west end of the Mall, while facing the Washington Monument and the Capitol.\n Even after the completion of the Lincoln Memorial, the choice of location for the Jefferson Memorial was by no means obvious: Jefferson \n\nIn 1934, Congress passed a Joint Resolution to establish a Thomas Jefferson Memorial Commission. The commission subsequently was given the authority to plan, design, and construct a memorial which was to be a tribute to Jefferson's many accomplishments: president, politician,  architect, farmer, and educator. The commission was to be for foundation of the memorial in the same way Jefferson was the foundation for this country. However, before the commission could began planning of the memorial they had some difficult questions to answer. Just how do you create a memorial fitting to a man who was so instrumental in the creation of this country? What type of design could embody the spirit and essence that was Thomas Jefferson? Could this even be done and if so where should this memorial sit so that all could see it? For the commission these were not easy answers. Early plans included displaying the Declaration of Independence in the Archives building and placing a memorial directly across from the Archives. Another suggestion involved creating a colonial style library as a source of education and inspiration. However, the commission along with FDR, who was now President of the United States, felt that none of these ideas were suitable for conveying Jefferson's ideals and personality. They felt that a memorial to Jefferson needed to show all aspects of his character. Eventually, the commission would settle on a site that would complete the plans proposed by the McMillan Commission of 1901. Essentially, the McMillan Commission idea was to complete a five-point composition in the middle of the city which was first proposed by Pierre L'Enfant, the original designer of the federal city. By 1922, all but the left arm of the great cross had been completed. It seemed only fitting that a memorial to Thomas Jefferson complete the final phase of this composition.\n\n \n\nAs one climbs the steps and pauses at the landings the memorial stones share a message. On the 12th Landing is a prayer offered by the City of Baltimore; on the 20th is a memorial presented by some Chinese Christians; on the 24th a presentation made by Sunday School children from New York and Philadelphia quoting Proverbs 10:7, Luke 18:16 and Proverbs 22:6. Praise be to God!\n\n About 193 memorial stones adorn the landings throughout the Washington Monument (different sources put the number at between 190 and 195), contributed by  memorial stones each state (and territory) as well as by other countries, U.S. cities and counties, fire departments, fraternal organizations (such as the Masons, the Sons of Temperance, and the Odd Fellows), military units, Native American tribes, and other groups.  (Peter Force, onetime mayor of Washington and a member of the Monument Society, got his own stone just before memorial stones from individuals were banned.)  Visitors have not been allowed to climb the fifty flights of stairs within the Monument since the 1970s (except on guided tours), in large part because too many memorial stones were damaged by souvenir-chipping vandals. Peter Force Since the political divisions that ultimately led to the Civil War were looming as the Monument was completed, some of the memorial stones include inscriptions entreating Heaven to preserve the Union, such as a stone at the 140-foot landing, contributed by the city of Baltimore, which reads as follows: Baltimore \n MAY HEAVEN TO THIS UNION\nCONTINUE ITS BENEFICENCE\nMAY BROTHERLY AFFECTION\nWITH UNION BE PERPETUAL\nMAY THE FREE CONSTITUTION\nWHICH IS THE WORK\nOF OUR ANCESTORS\nBE SACREDLY MAINTAINED\nAND ITS ADMINISTRATION\nBE STAMPED WITH\nWISDOM AND VIRTUE\n  One of the stones received from other countries was a memorial stone placed at the 220-foot landing, contributed by Chinese Christians from Ningo, Chekiang Province, China. The inscription on the stone is not a prayer, however, but a <!--eulogy-->eulogy for George Washington. eulogy Some of the memorial stones include Biblical citations, such as two stones on the 260-foot placed by the children of Sunday School groups from New York City and Philadelphia: New York Philadelphia \n\n THE MEMORY OF THE JUST IS BLESSED.\n                       \nProv. 10:7\nPRESENTED BY\nTHE CHILDREN OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS\nOF THE\nMETHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH\nIN THE\nCITY OF NEW YORK\nFeb. 22ND 1855\n\n  \n\n FROM THE SABBATH SCHOOL CHILDREN\n OF THE METHODIST E[PISCOPAL] CHURCH IN THE\nCITY & DISTRICTS OF PHILAD[ELPHIA].  JULY 4TH 1853.\nA PREACHED            A FREE\n     GOSPEL           PRESS\n WASHINGTON\nWE REVERE HIS MEMORY\n\n  The latter stone also includes a representation of an open Bible in relief at its center, on which are inscribed two Biblical quotations relating to children: Luke 18:16 (\"Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the Kingdom of God\") and Proverbs 22:6 (\"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it\"). \n\nWhen the cornerstone of the Washington Monument was laid on July 4th, 1848 deposited within it were many items including the Holy Bible presented by the Bible Society.\n\n A Holy Bible, presented by the Bible Society, was one of the many articles deposited in the recess of the cornerstone of the Washington Monument on 4 July 1848.  Some of the other items deposited were: \n\n\nConstitution of the United States and Declaration of Independence; presented by Mr. Hickey\nAmerican Constitutions; by W.

Anderson.\n\n\n \n\nI am awed by Washington's prayer for America. Have you never read it? Well now is your opportunity ... read on!\n\n The words quoted in the example above are inscribed on a bronze tablet adjoining the Washington pew in St. Paul's chapel in New York City, but they are not \"Washington's prayer for America.\"  They are taken from the last paragraph of a circular letter dated 8 June 1783, addressed to the governors of the thirteen states by General Washington upon his disbanding of the Continental Army at the end of the Revolutionary War.  There are three significant problems with the version of the words presented in the example cited at the head of this page, however: They weren't written by Washington, they weren't a prayer, and they have been substantially modified from the original. St. Paul's The letter from which the \"prayer\" passage was taken was written not by George Washington, but by his aide de camp, David Cobb.  (How much of the letter reflected Washington's own thoughts and <NOBR.words  and how much of it was created by Cobb  is unknown, but the style is very much unlike Washington's typical writings.)  The passage was not written as a stand-alone statement, but rather was merely the concluding paragraph of a considerably longer letter.  And finally, the wording has been altered to make the passage appear to be a prayer addressed to Almighty God, when in fact was a direct statement from Washington to a governor.  Compare the original and modified versions: \n\nORIGINAL:\nNow I make it my earnest prayer that God would have you and the State over which you preside, in His holy protection, that He would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to government, to entertain brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fellow citizens and the United States at large, and particularly for their brethren who have served in the field, and finally, that He would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility and pacific temper of mind which were the characteristics of the Divine Author of our blessed religion and without an humble imitation of whose example in these things we can never hope to be a happy nation. I have the honor to be, with much esteem and respect, Sir, your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant. George Washington.\n \n MODIFIED:\nAlmighty God; We make our earnest prayer that Thou wilt keep the United States in Thy holy protection; that Thou wilt incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to government; and entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another and for their fellow citizens of the United states at large. And finally that Thou wilt most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice,\nto love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind which were the characteristics of the Divine Author of our blessed religion, and without a humble imitation of whose example in these things we can never hope to be a happy nation. Grant our supplication, we beseech Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\n (Note that nowhere in George Washington's extant writings did he ever refer to Jesus Christ by name.) \n\nIt is clear when one studies the history of our great nation that Washington's America was one of the few countries in all the world established under the guidance, direction and banner of Almighty God, to whom was given all praise, honor and worship by the great men who formed and fashioned her pivotal foundations. And when one stops to observe the inscriptions found in public places all over our nation's capitol ... one will easily find the signature of God.\n\n One last point to clear up a misleading impression one might form after reading the above paragraph: although many of the inscriptions associated with the Washington Monument do indeed include religious references and sentiments, they reflect the tenor of public thought in mid-19th century America, not the America of George Washington's time.  Washington died in 1799, and the country he helped found was a very different place half a century later.

Many people are venturing out for the first time since the war began. To drink by the river. To meet a friend. To sit at a bar and have a cocktail. Or three. This is a city full of young people who have been cooped up for two years, first because of Covid and then the war with Russia. They yearn for contact. War makes that urge even greater, especially this war, where a Russian cruise missile can take you out, anywhere, anytime. And now that summer is in full swing, and the heavy fighting is mostly concentrated in Ukraine's east, hundreds of miles away, Kyiv is finally feeling a little less guilty about going out. \"This was a big question for me: Is it OK to work during the war? Is it OK to pour a cocktail during the war?\" said Bohdan Chehorka, a bartender. \"But the first shift was the answer. I could see it in the customers' eyes. It was psychotherapy for them.\" Similar to the video of the beach club, in May 2023, videos of Ukrainian citizens allegedly partying in nightclubs and bars went viral.

        "justification": "In late 2021, we received multiple inquiries from Snopes readers seeking to verify the authenticity of a fascinating story, told in several widely shared social media posts, about one of the pre-White House accomplishments of former President Jimmy Carter. For example, on Dec. 14 Jeff Lundeen posted a very widely shared tweet that contained an old picture of a young Carter, a screenshot of the anecdote, and the following caption: widely shared tweet Do you remember the world's very first nuclear meltdown? That time the US President, an expert in nuclear physics, heroically lowered himself into the reactor and saved Ottawa, Canada's capital? Sounds like schlocky action movie, but it actually happened!   That tweet was itself drawn from an earlier Facebook post by the Historical Society of Ottawa, which can be seen below: earlier Facebook post   The core claim from those accounts was that, as a young naval officer, Carter played a significant role in containing a nuclear meltdown. That claim was accurate, and we are issuing a rating of \"True.\"  Carter, who was born in 1924 and grew up in Plains, Georgia, had a relatively short but distinguished naval career, as summarized by the U.S. Navy itself: summarized by the U.S. Navy itself President James Earl \"Jimmy\" Carter graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946 with distinction, after which he was assigned to USSWyoming(E-AG 17) as an ensign. After completing two years of surface ship duty, Carter applied for submarine duty. He served as executive officer, engineering officer, and electronics repair officer on the submarineSSK-1. When Admiral Hyman G. Rickover (then a captain) started his program to create nuclear-powered submarines, Carter wanted to join the program and was interviewed and selected by Rickover. Carter was promoted to lieutenant and from 3 November 1952 to 1 March 1953, he served on temporary duty with the Naval Reactors Branch, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Washington, D.C., to assist \"in the design and development of nuclear propulsion plants for naval vessels.\" SSK-1 From 1 March to 8 October 1953, Carterwas preparingto become the engineering officer forUSSSeawolf(SSN-575), one of the first submarines to operate on atomic power.However, when his father died in July 1953 Carter resigned from the Navy and returned to Georgia to manage his family interests. Carter was honorably discharged on 9 October 1953 and transferred to the retired reserve at his request with the rank of lieutenant. USSSeawolf On Dec. 12, 1952, an accident took place at the National Research Experimental (NRX) nuclear reactor at Chalk River, near the Canadian capital of Ottawa.A detailed, official Atomic Energy of Canada account of the incident and its aftermath can be found here and here. here here Having been promoted to lieutenant in June of that year, Carter was at that time on secondment from the Navy to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's Division of Reactor Development at Schenectady, in upstate New York. A 2019 video, vetted and published by All Hands, the official magazine of the U.S. Navy, contained the following account of the future president's involvement in the cleanup operation: Due to a combination of mechanical failure and human error, a power surge of up to 90 megawatts caused some fuel rods to melt after rupturing in the NRX research reactor at Chalk River Laboratories. The reactor's core was baldy damaged, requiring a massive cleanup operation. This was the first incident of this magnitude, and Carter was ordered to lead a team of 23 people to assist in the cleanup. When he arrived on the scene, there was a duplicate reactor set up on a nearby tennis court, where he and his team would practice removing bolts and pieces as quickly as they could. Once lowered into the damage reactor, each person would only have 90 seconds to work, due to the extreme radioactivity. The core was shut down, rebuilt, and put back into operation without further incident.  Reflecting on the episode in 2008, Carter told the Canadian author Arthur Milnes that he and his team were exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation at Chalk River, as Milnes would later write for CNN: later write for CNN \"We were fairly well instructed then on what nuclear power was, but for about six months after that I had radioactivity in my urine,\" President Carter, now 86, told me during an interview for my new book in Plains in 2008. \"They let us get probably a thousand times more radiation than they would now. It was in the early stages and they didn't know.\" Despite the fears he had to overcome, Carter admits he was animated at the opportunity to put his top-secret training to use in the cleanup of the reactor, located along the Ottawa River northwest of Ottawa. \"It was a very exciting time for me when the Chalk River plant melted down,\" he continued in the same interview. \"I was one of the few people in the world who had clearance to go into a nuclear power plant,\" he said. \"There were 23 of us and I was in charge. I took my crew up there on the train.\" \nCarter, James Earl. https://public2.nhhcaws.local/research/histories/biographies-list/bios-c/carter-james-e.html. Accessed 6 Jan. 2022.",

The yachts foreign flag, though, was an illustration of how an allegedly America First administration is chock-full of moguls who have eagerly stashed their wealth offshore -- as long as doing so means avoiding taxes, regulations, transparency requirements and domestic employment laws. ... When her familys 164-foot yacht was untied from a Huron, Ohio dock, it was flying a flag of the Cayman Islands, where VesselTracker says the yacht is registered. According to federal records, the yacht is owned by RDV International Marine, which is an affiliate of the company that controls the DeVos familys fortune. ... When buying a vessel or cruising in U.S. waters, American yacht owners like the DeVoses could face state sales or use taxes. However, registering a yacht in a locale like the Caymans  under what has come to be known as a flag of convenience  allows those American yacht owners to effectively characterize themselves as foreigners for tax purposes, thereby avoiding the obligation of paying the standard sales and use levies, while enjoying police and Coast Guard services during times their vessels are untied. The report, which was also published by Newsweek, prompted several memes from left-wing and progressive social media accounts, such as the following Occupy Democrats post: Newsweek Occupy Democrats   \"The Other 98%\" posted a similar meme of their own: meme   On Facebook, the progressive \"Americans for Tax Fairness\" coalition posted a meme which claimed that the Cayman Islands registration applied to all the yachts owned by the DeVos family: meme   The yacht in question, Seaquest, is registered in the Cayman Islands, an arrangement that has potentially allowed its owner(s) to avoid paying taxes that they would otherwise face when travelling in the United States. However, it cannot be affirmed with certainty that this was the motivation behind the overseas registration. Furthermore, Betsy DeVos is not the owner of the vessel (although members of her family are), and a spokesperson for the DeVos family's main management company told us that neither she nor her husband Dick was responsible for the decision to register the yacht in the Cayman Islands. The yacht Seaquest is a 164-foot long (50-meter) yacht built by Westport and registered in George Town, the capital of the Cayman Islands. It is owned and managed by R.D.V. International Marine, according to the web site VesselTracker.com. The country's Shipping Registry confirmed to us that Seaquest's official Cayman Island's vessel number is 740641.

Corporation, the Michigan-registered management company which oversees the substantial financial investments and business interests of the DeVos family, headed by 92-year-old Richard DeVos, a multi-billionaire businessman and one of the co-founders of the \"multi-level marketing\" giant Amway. registered Dick DeVos (Richard DeVos Jr.), the husband of Betsy DeVos, is a director of R.D.V. Corporation, as is the couple's daughter Elisabeth (\"Elissa\") Lowery, Dick's sister Suzanne (\"Cheri\") DeVos, and his brothers Doug and Dan and their wives Maria and Pamella. Betsy DeVos was herself a company director until November 2016, according to her financial disclosure. director disclosure However, Chief Operating Officer of the Windquest Group, Greg McNeilly, told us that Dick and Betsy DeVos are not the owners of Seaquest. (The Windquest Group is a private investment firm founded by Dick DeVos, who is its president. Betsy DeVos was a director at Windquest until November 2016.) This was corroborated by Nick Wasmiller, a spokesperson for R.D.V. Corporation, who told us by email that Seaquest is owned (through R.D.V. International Marine) by Richard DeVos, who previously owned it in conjunction with his wife Helen prior to her death in October 2017: \"Dick and Betsy DeVos do not own Seaquest and have never held ownership in the watercraft ... Dick and Betsy DeVos had no role in the registration of Seaquest nor the management of any subsequent efforts to maintain that registration.\" So the three memes referenced above (from Occupy Democrats, the Other 98% and Americans for Tax Fairness) are factually inaccurate in alleging that Betsy DeVos both owns Seaquest and registered it in the Cayman Islands, or that she registered \"her family's fleet of 10 yachts\" in the Cayman Islands. The yacht Seaquest is, and has always been, owned by Betsy DeVos' father-in-law, according to spokespersons for two DeVos family companies, and Betsy herself has never made any management or registration decisions about it, according to a spokesperson for R.D.V. Corporation. A 2017 investigation by the Wall Street Journal outlined how the extended DeVos family structures and manages their investments, business interests, and assets, which include nine vessels other than Seaquest: Blue Sky, Quantum Racing, Delta Victor, Reflection, Attitude, Sterling, Windquest, Zorro, and De Lus. investigation In response to our question, Wasmiller confirmed that these other nine vessels are \"owned by various DeVos family entities\" but said they are \"registered in the United States.\" We checked the U.S. Coast Guard's Vessel Documentation Center database, and found that the nine DeVos family-related vessels listed by the Wall Street Journal are indeed all registered to ports in the United States, specifically in Michigan, Delaware, and Florida. database So the Americans for Tax Fairness meme is also false on the grounds that it claims Betsy DeVos registered \"her family's fleet of 10 yachts in the Cayman Islands,\" but in reality nine of those vessels are registered in the United States, and the one that is registered in the Cayman Islands is not managed or owned by Betsy DeVos. Use tax While Betsy DeVos does not personally own or manage Seaquest, it is possible that its registration in the Cayman Islands, as opposed to the United States, might have allowed its owner, Richard DeVos (via RDV International Marine) to avoid incurring certain taxes (though this is not certain), as Capital & Main reported: reported If the vessel were registered in, say, Grand Rapids, Michigan  the state where RDV is located and that has in the past made an effort to compel yacht owners to pay use taxes  the SeaQuest would likely be subject to Michigans six percent use tax. That would require the DeVos empire to cough up about $2.4 million ... The figure of $2.4 million represents six percent of $40 million, which is the estimated value given to Seaquest in several news reports, including Capital & Main's investigation. The source of that evaluation is not clear, with many articles describing the yacht as being \"reportedly valued at $40 million,\" without providing any attribution for that number. We found one online broker selling a brand-new 164-foot Westport yacht (like Seaquest) for $42.5 million, and another 2013 listing for a similar vessel which presented a sale price of $34 million. Seaquest was built in 2008, so it's possible its purchase price was lower than $40 million.  yacht listing Furthermore, it's unclear whether Seaquest would actually incur a tax liability even if it were registered in Michigan.  What's in question here is a type of taxation called \"use tax,\" which applies to tangible products and entities that are brought into and used or consumed in a particular jurisdiction (in this case the state of Michigan), in circumstances where sales tax does not apply. Section 205.93 of Michigan's Compiled Laws states that: states There is levied upon and there shall be collected from every person in this state a specific tax, including both the local community stabilization share and the state share, for the privilege of using, storing, or consuming tangible personal property in this state at a total combined rate equal to 6% of the price of the property or services ... So, in principle at least, if you own a yacht that is habitually docked or sailed in Michigan, that is likely to be regarded as storage or usage, and you would owe the state of Michigan use tax of six percent of the price of the yacht. However, certain exemptions from this use tax exist when the property is purchased outside Michigan, is \"used solely for personal, nonbusiness purposes,\" and \"the property is purchased by a person who is not a resident of this state at the time of purchase and is brought into this state more than 90 days after the date of purchase\" or \"the property is purchased by a person who is a resident of this state at the time of purchase and is brought into this state more than 360 days after the date of purchase.\" We don't know whether Richard DeVos was a resident of Michigan at the time he bought Seaquest in 2008, and we don't know how much time elapsed between his purchase of the yacht and its arrival in the state. Therefore, even if Seaquest were registered in Michigan and not the Cayman Islands, it's not certain that vessel would be subject to use tax, although this is certainly a possibility. Wasmiller, on behalf of R.D.V. Corporation, provided an alternative explanation for the decision to register Seaquest in the Cayman Islands: Non-commercial watercraft exceeding 100 feet, such as Seaquest, are commonly registered in the Cayman Islands. The countrys strict safety, manning and operation standards for non-commercial watercraft are widely recognized in international waters and closely align with requirements commonly encountered during global travel. As a result, registration in the Cayman Islands provides for the most efficient entrance and exit of various jurisdictions. In boating terms, its a widely recognized flag -- a significant benefit when traveling internationally, thus the registration of Seaquest there. Also of note, it is the policy of RDV International Marine that all employees aboard Seaquest are eligible to work in the United States, as the boat does periodically enter U.S. waterways. Conclusion The claims contained in the viral memes we listed are based on several assumptions, made without sufficient evidence, and contradicted by spokespersons for Dick and Betsy DeVos and Richard DeVos. First, RDV International Marine owns Seaquest, and RDV International Marine is an entity of RDV Corporation, the DeVos \"family office\" which oversees the family's substantial business interests, assets and investments. However, even though Betsy DeVos is a former director of RDV Corporation, and her family members are closely intertwined with the company, this does not mean that every asset owned by every entity of RDV Corporation is also owned (even in part) by every member of the DeVos family. It is a family company, but it is not a co-op. This logical and evidentiary leap is also directly contradicted by spokespersons for two DeVos-related companies, who stated on the record that Richard DeVos owns Seaquest, and that neither Betsy nor Dick DeVos have ever owned even part of it nor have ever made decisions about its management and registration. Second, there is a significant evidentiary leap from the fact that one DeVos-related yacht is registered in the Cayman Islands to the claim that 10 DeVos-related vessels are registered there. This is factually inaccurate. Nine of the vessels listed as DeVos assets in a Wall Street Journal article are registered in the United States. And finally, there is an assumption (albeit a more reasonable one) involved in the claim that registering Seaquest in the Cayman Islands allows its owner(s) to avoid paying taxes in the United States. Michigan state law allows for certain exemptions from the obligation to pay \"use tax,\" and it cannot be said with certainty that Richard DeVos, the owner of Seaquest, did not meet the criteria for those exemptions. The claim that the tax obligation allegedly being avoided amounts to $2.4 million is also based on an assumption about the price of the yacht itself, which is not known for certain.

On 1 June 2018, he wrote: wrote If you're a new follower since yesterday, I hope it's because you think I'm funny (or you like my art!). If you do it because you think I broke out an actual conspiracy... Oh boy. He also told us via e-mail that he was surprised by the amount of traction the tweet gained online: I've tweeted jokey posts like this before but nothing has exploded in such a huge way. I just did a spin on what was already being broadly tweeted about Melania's recent absence and her odd statement saying she was OK. I haven't been able to read reactions closely because they've been pouring in very fast, but whenever someone seems to comment that my post was real, or saying it was \"fake news\", I felt kind of sad that they missed the joke.",

Laci Peterson, a 27 year old California woman who is eight months pregnant, was last seen walking her dog in a neighborhood park on Christmas Eve. Her husband, Scott, was away on a fishing trip in the San Francisco Bay area, but called police when he returned home and found his wife missing. She was last seen wearing black pants and a white long sleeve top. Laci also has a sunflower tattoo on her left ankle. Her family is offering a $500,000 reward for information leading to her safe return to them. The Internet is huge and covers the whole world.  If you pass this photo to just 5 friends, and they each pass it on to 5 of their friends, maybe this picture will reach someone who has seen Laci and can help find her.  Anyone with information should call the Modesto Police Dept. Anonymous hotline at (209) 342-6166\n Origins:  The   information quoted above is generally correct in all its details.  According to the Modesto Police: Modesto Police \n\nOn 12-24-02 at about 5:48 p.m., Modesto Police received a phone call from a man stating that his pregnant wife had not been seen since 9:30 a.m. that day. Scott Peterson, of Modesto, left to the Bay Area to go fishing. His wife, Laci Denise Peterson, 26 years, eight months pregnant, stayed home to shop for dinner that evening and to walk their dog at East La Loma Park, commonly known as Dry Creek Park. After Scott was done fishing, he tried to call Laci from his cell phone but did not reach her. When he arrived home, he discovered his dog in the back yard of his house with the leash still attached. There was nothing unusual found in the house to indicate anything had happened and Lacis purse was still in the house. Scott and family members began searching the park for Laci and called the Police.\n Despite intensive search and investigative efforts since Laci's disappearance on Christmas Eve 2002, and rewards totalling $500,000 for information leading to Laci's safe return, police were unable to turn up any leads on her whereabouts or the circumstances regarding her disappearance.  In April 2003 Laci's body washed up on a San Francisco Bay beach, and her husband was arrested and charged with capital murder.

The results were decried as evidence of the search engine giant's having a \"liberal, anti-police agenda,\" because an example sentence demonstrating the meaning of the word \"trap\" referenced police herding \"demonstrators into a trap\" and then attacking and arresting them:  The definition displayed above does appear when you enter the word \"trap\" into Google, but this screenshot is frequently shared with misinformation about how Google works.  The main misconception is that the definition for the word \"trap\" was written by Google. However, the search engine giant does not maintain their own dictionary, nor do they provide their own answers to specific queries. Instead, Google points users to what their algorithms determine to be the most relevant information available on the Internet. In this case, the example sentence was most likely taken from OxfordDictionaries.com (although the same example appears in other online dictionaries as well). OxfordDictionaries.com dictionaries Even though the example sentence offered by Google may have come from Oxford Dictionaries, that organization's lexicographers did not write it either. Oxford Dictionaries explained in a January 2016  blog post that they glean example sentences from real-world sampling: sentences We often receive queries about the example sentences on OxfordDictionaries.com. Some people assume that they are written by the lexicographers who produce the definitions, but in fact they are chosen from real-life examples collected on Oxfords corporavast databases of text drawn from many publications, websites, and other sources. Oxford takes an evidence-based approach to lexicography, meaning that all entries must be based on actual examples of the word in use. In this case, the example sentence was apparently taken from an article written by Dave Lindorff in June 2003 and titled \"Civil Liberties Take a Dive Post-9/11\": article Repressive and threatening measures by federal, state and local officials have included illegal spying, infiltration, violent actions, and intimidation, and have often been supported by local authorities. During a September 2002 demonstration near the White House, capital police deliberately herded 400 peaceful demonstrators into a trap and then attacked and arrested them, in a case that is still being challenged by the ACLU. In Oakland, California, using rubber and wooden bullets, police fired on people peacefully protesting the use of the citys port facilities for shipping military equipment. The use of \"trap\" in this particular sentence, then, is not a subtle attempt by Google to further a liberal agenda, but an example taken from an article about an actual event, demonstrating a very particular meaning of the word.

Buried below all of the more recent shared posts was a \"trending\" post in which Trump had offered a \"Merry Christmas\" message on Dec. 25. That post truly did include the words, \"May they rot in hell,\" which appeared in all capital letters. The imprecation was aimed at so-called \"thugs\" Trump claimed were \"looking to destroy our once great USA.\"  The full post (archived) read as follows: post archived Merry Christmas to all, including Crooked Joe Bidens ONLY HOPE, Deranged Jack Smith, the out of control Lunatic who just hired outside attorneys, fresh from the SWAMP (unprecedented!), to help him with his poorly executed WITCH HUNT against TRUMP and MAGA.

Washington Examiner We reached out to the Trump campaign by email to ask about the statement and will update this story if we receive a response. In addition to the Truth Social post on Christmas Day, Trump also released a video message on Christmas Eve that did not include the words, \"May they rot in hell.\" Rather, the video simply showed Trump offering positive, forward-looking sentiments about Christmas, U.S. military servicemembers and the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election.

The early image showed a dystopian scene with burned out and abandoned tanks and widespread destruction. The latter image showed a street without tanks that had been rebuilt:  These pictures authentically show the location on the same street: Vokzal'na Street. Russian military activity in Bucha centered around the intersections of Vokzal'na Street and Yablunska Street.  It was here, according to a Pulitzer Prize-winning, eight-month visual investigation by The New York Times, that Russian paratroopers from the 234th Air Assault Regiment, led by Lt. Col. Artyom Gorodilov, committed some of the worst atrocities of the early invasion:  according visual investigation An eight-month visual investigation by The New York Times concluded that the perpetrators of the massacre along Yablunska Street were Russian paratroopers from the 234th Air Assault Regiment led by Lt. Col. Artyom Gorodilov. The evidence shows that the killings were part of a deliberate and systematic effort to ruthlessly secure a route to the capital, Kyiv. Soldiers interrogated and executed unarmed men of fighting age, and killed people who unwittingly crossed their paths  whether it was children fleeing with their families, locals hoping to find groceries or people simply trying to get back home on their bicycles. Ukrainian forces recaptured Bucha on March 31. Following Russia's retreat, satellite imagery showed the bodies of executed civilians lining Yablunska Street at its intersection with Vokzal'na Street.  the bodies The tank appearing in the viral tweet also appeared in other widely circulated images taken in April 2022, and it was identified by NPR and others as showing Vokzal'na Street.

Oak leaf gall mites are so small that they can float on the wind, and pass through window or door screens and loosely-woven clothing.\" Typical itch mite bites measure about 2 centimeters and are itchy and painful when scratched, often resulting in secondary bacterial infection.

Itch mite welts make pimple-like lesions after around 12 hours and can be present for up to two weeks, noted IDPH.  Experts recommend not scratching the bites, as scratching can lead to a secondary infection. Rather, treat rash areas with anti-itch creams or oral antihistamines to alleviate itching. While itch mites are present in Washington, D.C., it is recommended that residents avoid sitting under or near areas with oak trees present and to be aware of brown and crusty edges on the leaves of oak trees as that is typically an indication of an infestation.

Dice's stunt, embedded below, did not mention a gay pride flag in its description: U.S. Citizens Sign Petition to Ban American Flag and Issue New Design for the New World Order! Media analyst Mark Dice asked beachgoers in San Diego to sign a petition he said would result in issuing a new American flag for a \"New World Order\" because the current one is offensive to some immigrants and is associated with imperialism and racism.

This is a movement founded on love and grounded in the nobility and dignity of every human life. When we look into the eyes of a newborn child, we see the beauty and the human soul and the majesty of God's creation (4).  We know that every life has meaning and that (4) every life is worth protecting (3, 4), As president, I will always defend the first right in our Declaration of Independence -- the right to life. During my first week in office, I reinstated the Mexico City Policy. We have taken bold action to protect the religious freedoms for doctors, nurses, and charities like the Little Sisters Of The Poor We issued a new proposal to prohibit Title Ten taxpayer funding from going to any clinic that performs abortions. We are supporting the loving choice of adoption and foster care, including through the support of faith-based adoption services. And I am supporting the U.S. Senate's effort to make permanent the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer funding for abortion in spending bills. Today I have signed a letter to Congress to make clear that if they send any legislation to my desk that weakens the protection of human life, I will issue a veto. (1) And we have the support to uphold those vetoes. Every child is a sacred gift from God (2). As this year's March For Life theme says, each person is unique from Day One. That is a very important phrase. Unique from Day One. And so true. I want to thank Americans who traveled all across the country to march for life, and I especially want to thank so many young people who give us hope for the future. Together we will work to save the lives of unborn children, so they have a chance to live and to love, to thrive and to dream, and to bless our nation and reach their full and glorious potential. Thank you. God bless you and your families, and God bless America.

            "Does Microsoft's Wingdings font contain hidden anti-Semitic codes?"
        ],
        "justification": "In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York's World Trade Center came the resurgence of some several-year-old rumors about \"secret messages\" lurking within Microsoft's symbolic Webdings and Wingdings fonts, one innocuous and the other supposedly pointedly anti-Semitic: typing the letters NYC using the Webdings font in Microsoft Word (or similar application) produced, as shown below, an image of an eye, a heart, and a city skyline, assumed to be a rebus form of the phrase \"I love New York\" (although the last image could really be any big city skyline). But switching to the WingDings font produced an image of a skull and crossbones, a Star of David, and a thumbs-up symbol, read by some conspiracy-minded folks as a symbolic approval of the killing of Jews:   The images associated with the capital letters N-Y-C in the Webdings font, at least, were deliberately chosen, as Microsoft spokesperson Kimberly Kuresman explained in 2001: When Microsoft developed a new graphical font, Webdings, in 1997, Kuresman said typographers took pains to ensure that the image corresponding with the capital letters NYC was a pleasant one. Users who type in that string of letters in Webdings are greeted with graphics for an eye, a heart and a city skyline, symbols for the message \"I Love New York.\" The darker message supposedly associated with those same letters in the Wingsdings font was noted as far back as 1992, when the New York Post tabloid published an breathless article about the discovery of a \"secret anti-Semitic message apparently urging death to Jews in New York City\": ANTI-JEWISH CODE LURKS IN POPULAR SOFTWAREOne of the world's best-selling computer programs contains a secret anti-Semitic message apparently urging death to Jews in New York City. A computer consultant discovered the diabolic message while installing Microsoft's new Windows 3.1 software for a client yesterday. The consultant was testing a mailing-address use of the program when he noticed the letters \"NYC\" had been replaced by a hateful message - a skull and crossbones, the Star of David and an approving thumbs-up symbol. Microsoft strongly denies any hidden message. Others disagree. \"There's no way it could be a random coincidence,\" said Brian Young, a friend of the consultant, who does not wish to be named. \"It's pretty scary. I was pretty shocked by the whole thing.\" Computer owners who use Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word or any other Microsoft program containing a print font named \"Wingdings\" can duplicate the anti-Semitic message by typing the letters \"NYC\" on their screen. Microsoft said \"Wingdings\" was designed by Bigelow and Holmes, an outside vendor, and denied that Microsoft intentionally designed the secret message. Prof. Charles Bigelow confirmed that his company provided the symbols, but insisted that Microsoft made the final \"mapping\" decisions assigning his symbols to specific keys on the keyboard. But a senior Microsoft spokesman said the charge that the fonts contain a hidden message is \"outrageous.\" \"It's like saying that if you randomly type out characters on a keyboard to spell 'Satan', you can do that, but it's incredible to say that there's anti-Semitism in Microsoft or one of its vendors,\" said Charles Hemingway. But Young, who discussed the matter with other computer consultants, isn't so sure it's just a coincidence. The \"Wingdings\" font contains no letters  just 255 symbols. Young calculated the odds of three letters of the alphabet being combined with 255 symbols, and said he found that the odds of obtaining the message were less than one in a trillion. \"It's mind-blowing,\" said Young. \"Somebody's responsible for this. This is very offensive.\" \"I found it hard to believe some of the stories about the resurgence of Nazi sympathizers  but this puts things back into perspective.\" When this conspiracy rumor resurfaced and began to blaze its way around the Internet immediately after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Microsoft issued a statement disclaiming any malicious intent and explaining why the font had not since been altered to put the issue to rest: We can certainly understand how people would respond with some shock to this apparent issue. We did too when it first came up nine years ago and we investigated it thoroughly in partnership with the Anti-Defamation League. The conclusion was that the sequence in the Wingdings character set is coincidental and that there was no malicious intent. In fact, it impacted several software companies at the time and continues to do so. Unfortunately, there was not an easy way to fix the problem. We understand that this requires explanation. At the simplest level, wingdings and webdings are much like an alphabet of characters and provide thousands of potential combinations from which a person could choose. Changing the character set would create an impact of unknown scale on existing data and code using the affected font. Again, using the example of the alphabet, what would happen to existing documents and applications if we switched around a handful of letters? The likely result is that we would create significant issues for people, cause some unintended humorous moments and several offensive ones. For that reason Wingdings has been left unaltered since its inception. Wired magazine also interviewed a typographer who noted that the arrangement of symbols in the Wingdings font was surely nothing more than coincidence: Don Hosek, a typographer and editor of the typeface magazine Serif, said that graphic font designers don't usually pay much attention to the way particular images correspond to letters on the keyboard. \"We have enough symbols and combinations that it's almost inevitable that you'll find something that's a little sinister,\" he said. Although it's common for designers to include one or two deliberate messages  usually something innocent like a logo  it's safe to assume that the image strings on Wingdings were randomly generated. Hosek said he has known the creators of Wingdings  Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes of the font design firm Bigelow & Holmes  for more than a decade and is convinced that they had not intended to offend anyone. \"These are two of the most peace-loving people on the face of the Earth,\" he said. \"There's no way it was anything other than an unfortunate coincidence.\" (Penn Jillette, of Penn & Teller fame, also penned a caustic essay on this phenomenon for PC Computing back in 1992.) essay The last coincidence mentioned in the example quoted at the head of this page, that the arrangements of symbols corresponding to the string \"Q33NY\" in the Wingdings font is a \"sign that Microsoft were involved in the terrorist attack,\" is purely a contrived one. Although typing the characters Q-3-3-N-Y in the Wingdings font does produce the string of images shown below (an airplane, two vertical rectangular shapes, a skull and crossbones, and a Star of David), none of this has any real relevance to the 9/11 attacks: Q33NY was not the flight or tail number of either of the planes that were crashed into the World Trade Center that day, the rectangular shapes represent pieces of paper with writing on them, not buildings, and the terrorist attacks were neither perpetrated by nor targeted against Jews.   The numerous suggestions that have since been offered about what 'Q33' really does refer to (everything from a New York bus route to a verse from the Quran) merely highlight how easy it is to find significance in anything, meaningful or not.

The original was produced nearly a year earlier, in July 2018, and shows a mixture of Trump fans and supporters of Tommy Robinson, a right-wing activist who founded an anti-Muslim group:  Trump's visit to the United Kingdom in July 2018 coincided with a \"Free Tommy Robinson\" rally. Many of the attendees carried \"Britain Loves Trump\" signs, wore MAGA hats, and at one point chanted \"We Love Trump.\" Here's how Fox News and the Associated Press described the event: Fox News Associated Press Associated Press: A small rally supporting US President Donald Trump in London has been joined by thousands of supporters of prominent right-wing activist Tommy Robinson. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, founded an anti-Muslim group and was jailed for contempt of court after broadcasting outside a criminal trial in May. Fox News: Thousands of Trump supporters and right-wing activists took to the nations capital on Saturday  a day after anti-Trump protesters had dominated the city. While the displays of right-wing support were nowhere near as large as the enormous anti-Trump march that demanded the international medias attention the day before, it was still a significant show of support for Trump from those eager to counter the claim that Trump had been unanimously rejected by Britons. The day started with a small pro-Trump rally outside the U.S. Embassy, featuring numerous red MAGA hats and U.S. and U.K. flags -- as well as a few anti-Hillary Clinton shirts. Later, approximately 3,000 people turned out near Trafalgar Square to show their backing of Trump as well as jailed right-wing and anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson.

MSNBC reporter Adam Serwer wrote: previously wrote For two decades in Congress he was a reliable member of the Southern bloc, helping to stonewall civil rights legislation. As [biographer Robert] Caro recalls, Johnson spent the late 1940s railing against the \"hordes of barbaric yellow dwarves\" in East Asia. Buying into the stereotype that blacks were afraid of snakes (who isn't afraid of snakes?) he'd drive to gas stations with one in his trunk and try to trick black attendants into opening it. Once, Caro writes, the stunt nearly ended with him being beaten with a tire iron. Yet by the timeJohnson became president after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, he was ready to plow all of his political capitalto the passage of the civil rights legislation initiatedby his predecessor. By most accounts, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 couldn't have become lawwhen it did had not LBJ personally wheedled, cajoled, and shamed his former colleagues in the House and Senateinto voting for it. One of the secrets of his successwas the ability to speak the raciallyinsensitivelanguage of his fellow Southerners. He understood them. He understood their reluctance and in some cases downright refusal to teardown the walls ofracial segregation. He knewracism from the inside, and he knew well the role the rich and powerful played in promulgating it.   That's the contextof one of the most famous statements on race ever attributed to President Johnson, an off-the-cuff observation he made to ayoung staffer, Bill Moyers, after encountering a display of blatant racism during a political visit to the South. Moyers tells it in the first person: observation We were in Tennessee. During the motorcade, he spotted some ugly racial epithets scrawled on signs. Late that night in the hotel, when the local dignitaries had finished the last bottles of bourbon and branch water and departed, he started talking about those signs. \"I'll tell you what's at the bottom of it,\" he said. \"If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.\" In the blunt vernacular that he loved to use, LBJ was describing what the television pundits of today would probably call the politics of resentment and divisiveness. It is still very much with us. Knowles, Elizabeth M. (ed.).The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations.   Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999. ISBN9780198601739 (p. 408).

According to his ex-wife, who divorced him in February 2015, the date at which the murders began coincides with Mr Rordiguez's heart transplant operation. She says that his personality changed dramatically after he got his new heart, and that the operation is responsible for his actions....The identity of organ donor is often kept secret, but the police investigators were given access to Mr. Rodriguez's file. They discovered that the organ donor was a convicted serial killer named Dereck Emery, who was executed by the state in 2013. The article included photographs of two men: purported  serial killer Dereck Emery (above, right) and donor heart recipient Michael Rodriquez (above, left). However, the individuals depicted were actually Derby, Connecticut, resident Anthony White (arrested in September 2015 for an altercation with a cab driver) and Tampa resident Bernard Marsonek (arrested in March 2014 on animal cruelty charges).

            "President Obama did not eliminate the National Day of Prayer or pray with Muslims on Capitol Hill instead."
        ],
        "justification": "The United States has observed many unofficial national days of prayer throughout its history until 1952, when President Harry S. Truman signed a bill proclaiming a National Day of Prayer (\"on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches, in groups, and as individuals\"). This bill did not establish a specific calendar date for the event, but left it up to each president to designate a date of his choosing. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan fixed the date of the National Day of Prayer as the first Thursday of May. In 2009 (and every year since), rumors were circulated claiming that President Barack Obama had \"canceled\" that year's National Day of Prayer: \nPresident Obama has decided that there will no longer be a \"National Day of Prayer\" held in May. He doesn't want to offend anyone. Where was his concern about offending Christians last January when he allowed the Muslims to hold a day of prayer on the capitol grounds. As an American Christian \"I am offended.\" if you agree, copy and paste no matter what religion you are. This country was built on freedom! If he gets re-elected \"it's all over but the crying\" When we get 100,000,000, that's one hundred million willing Christians to BOND together, voice their concerns and vote, we can take back America with God's help. Please become one of the One hundred million, then lets get 200 million. It can be done by sending this email to your friends. Do the math. It only takes a willing heart and a fed up soul. God Bless America and Shine your light on Her.. In 1952 President Truman established one day a year as a \"National Day of Prayer.\" In 1988 President Reagan designated the First Thursday in May of each year as the National Day of Prayer. In June 2007 (then) Presidential Candidate Barack Obama declared that the USA \"Was no longer a Christian nation.\" This year President Obama canceled the 21st annual National Day of Prayer ceremony at the White House under the ruse of \"not wanting to offend anyone\" BUT... on September 25, 2009 from 4 AM until 7 PM, a National Day of Prayer FOR THE MUSLIM RELIGION was Held on Capitol Hill Beside the White House. There were over 50,000 Muslims in D.C. that day. HE PRAYED ALL DAY WITH THE MUSLIMS It Didn't matter if \"we Christians\" Were offended by this event - He really do not hold us as a nation of Christians! The direction this country is headed should strike fear in the heart of every Christian, especiall knowing that the He and the Muslim religion believes that if Christians cannot be converted, they should be annihilated. This is not a rumor.\n These claims were false and were based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the National Day of Prayer and the role of the President of the United States in its observation. No official ceremony (presidential or otherwise) is prescribed for the observance of the National Day of Prayer: it is a day on which the people of the U.S. are called upon \"to turn to God in prayer and meditation,\" however they choose to do so. President Obama opted to issue the traditional proclamation designating the National Day of Prayer in 2009 (as he did again in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014,2015, and 2016) while observing the occasion privately: proclamation 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 \"Prayer is something that the president does every day,\" said White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs. Adding that Obama would sign a proclamation to recognize the day. \"I think the president understands, in his own life and in his family's life, the role that prayer plays. And I would denote that the administrations prior to the past one did proclamations. That's the way the president will publicly observe the national prayer day. But, as I said, privately, he'll pray as he does every day.\" Other observances of the National Day of Prayer in the nation's capital have continued throughout President Obama's administration, with the 2015and 2016 events streamed live online from the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill. 2015 2016 Although it is true that President Obama chose not to host an ecumenical service in the East Room of the White House in observance of the National Day of Prayer as his predecessor, President George W. Bush, did each year throughout his tenure in office, that service was a personal preference of President Bush; it was neither an official ceremony prescribed by the bill that established the National Day of Prayer nor a long-standing presidential tradition.  In fact, George W. Bush was the only president who ever regularly organized White House events in observance that day: President Ronald Reagan hosted only one throughout his eight years in office (a 1982 Rose Garden event), President George H.W. Bush also hosted only one during his four years in office (a 1989 State Dining Room breakfast), and President Bill Clinton hosted none at all in the course of his eight-year presidency. Claims that President Obama has \"cancelled\" the National Day of Prayer because he opted not to hold a public prayer ceremony in observance of the occasion are therefore akin to asserting that Independence Day was \"canceled\" if a president chose not to attend a fireworks show on the 4th of July. The status of the National Day of Prayer became uncertain on 15 April 2010 when a federal judge ruled in favor of a challenge brought by the Freedom from Religion Foundation and held that the National Day of Prayer was unconstitutional. The Obama administration was actually the defendant in that suit, arguing in favor of retaining the National Day of Prayer: defendant President Barack Obama, who is charged with enforcing the statute by issuing a proclamation each year, and his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, contend that the statute is simply an \"acknowledgment of the role of religion in American life\" and is indistinguishable from government practices that courts have upheld in the past. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb says her order does not block any prayer day until after appeals in the case are exhausted. White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said that the ruling therefore doesn't prevent Obama from issuing a Day of Prayer proclamation in May and that the president will do so. The Obama administration appealed the ruling, and in April 2011 it was overturned by a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, who decreed that the Freedom from Religion Foundation and its plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the National Day of Prayer. A December 2009 version of this item offered a photograph purportedly documenting President Obama's participation in an \"Islamic Prayer Day\" observance at the White House: \nPHOTO: Obama Prays to Allah... This is OUR President at an \"Islamic Prayer Day\" session LAST WEEK AT THE WHITE HOUSE Oh, yes, Obama prays all right:  WITH THE MUSLIMS!! This is OUR President at a MOSQUE prayer session LAST WEEK AT THE WHITE HOUSE, on the site where the INAUGURATION is held every 4 years! He canceled OUR CHRISTIAN \"NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER\"...Now. ..THIS. For Obama to continue as our president is an INSULT TO OUR FOUNDING FATHERS! This photograph does not show President Obama instead observing \"Islamic Prayer Day\" or engaging in a \"mosque prayer session\" at the White House. This picture of the president was taken at Istanbul's Blue Mosque (where protocol dictates that visitors remove their shoes before entering), the national mosque of Turkey, during the chief executive's two-day state visit to that country in April 2009.

Moreover, given the increasing diversity of America's population, the dangers of sectarianism have never been greater. Whatever we once were, we are no longer just a Christian nation; we are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, a Buddhist nation, a Hindu nation, and a nation of nonbelievers.

Variations of the ad also called the guidelines a \"policy,\" \"practice,\" or \"rule,\" perhaps referring to car insurance. The ads displayed a different state name, depending on where readers viewed the ad. Aside from California, we found ads displaying Illinois, Nevada, Michigan, Florida, Utah, Oregon, Massachusetts, Indiana, Arizona, and Virginia. One variation of the ad simply said \"Local Area.\"   Regardless of their geographic target, the ads were misleading. While it's true that some drivers can pay less if they drive less, we were unable to find any new specific policies or guidelines launched by U.S. states for drivers who used their cars less than 50 miles per day. pay less if they drive less In 2015, the American Automobile Association, better known as AAA, published the results of a study that said motorists \"drive, on average, 29.2 miles per day.\" In other words, the misleading ads were casting a wide net, since perhaps a majority of Americans drive less than 50 miles per day. But keep in mind, the more people who followed where the ads led, the more compensation the ad's funders would receive. published the results of a study Readers who clicked on the advertisements were led to a page that appeared to mimic the Fox News website's red and blue colors, as well as its layout.

The headline began with the state name where the reader was currently in: \"Nevada Drivers Are Ditching Their Insurance Company & Doing This Instead!\" a page   We found no indication that Fox News had any involvement with the advertisements. The personalized pages, based on the reader's location, also claimed to know \"one simple truth that most drivers don't know\" about car insurance. Again, while it may be true that some companies will bill at lower rates for drivers who drive less, we were unable to find information about a specific car insurance rule for driving less than 50 miles. We found multiple asterisk footnotes at the bottom of the page, which appeared to be an attempt to explain the misleading nature of the initial advertisement. The first mentioned a \"clarification of the advertising headline\" and defined the word \"rule.\" A double asterisk footnote also mentioned a clarification on \"the headlines leading to this advertorial.\" Below that, the page read in capital letters: \"THIS IS AN ADVERTORIAL AND NOT AN ACTUAL NEWS ARTICLE, BLOG, OR CONSUMER PROTECTION UPDATE.\" The final footnote said that the page's creator earned \"compensation for product reviews and referrals or purchases\" made through its links. It also said that the website \"is in no way affiliated with any news source,\" perhaps referring to a prominent news organization that featured specific red and blue colors at the top of its pages.",

        "justification": "Claim:  Paralegal for elite New York law firm produces memo rating the quality of local sushi restaurants.  \nStatus:  Undetermined.\n Origins:  Most of us working stiffs have, at one time or another, been asked to perform some menial task  a trivial and demeaning assignment outside the scope of our employment, foisted upon us to satisfy the   whim of a superior or a client.  The usual response to being burdened with such petty duty is to express displeasure by griping, foot-dragging, and completing the odious chore with as little expenditure of effort as possible.  Once in a while, however, an employee chooses to highlight his dissatisfaction with having been handed a belittling task through the opposite approach  by going far beyond the call of duty and fulfilling the obligation in outlandishly thorough and extravagant fashion. The latter technique is the conceit behind the infamous \"sushi memo,\" a document purportedly produced in July 2003 by a paralegal at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, a top New York law firm, after one of the firm's partners, disappointed with the quality of takeout sushi in the area, asked her to find a better source for the popular Japanese bonnes bouches.  The paralegal responded to the request with alacrity, interviewing co-workers, conducting on-line research, and scanning Zagat reviews to generate a three-page memo (entitled \"Sushi Options\") complete with footnotes and exhibits.   sushi memo Was this memo a form of tacit protest by an underling disgruntled at being selected for a menial undertaking, or was it, in the words of the New York Times, an illustration of \"the climate of a large law firm for many paralegals, who may feel compelled to give every assignment the single-minded vigor of a filing in a capital case, even if they are only helping to find some particularly fresh raw tuna.\"  Or was it perhaps simply a parody, something deliberately crafted as a joke to lampoon both these concepts?  That's no easy question to answer, as the New York Times discovered: \n\nNeither Ms. Parker nor Kimberly Arena, the paralegal, returned phone calls seeking comment. Jason Schaefer, a junior lawyer at the firm whose name is also on the memo, declined to comment and hung up the phone for emphasis. In fact, no one at Paul, Weiss, whose Midtown offices are surrounded by sushi restaurants, wanted to discuss the memo, making it hard to figure out if it is serious.\n\n The only answer a spokesperson from the law firm would provide about the sushi memo was to deny that any client of the firm had been billed for the time spent in preparing it. Whether or not the \"sushi memo\" is on the level, it's a wonderfully humorous effort deserving of enshrinement on these pages.

        "justification": "An image supposedly showing a gorilla knitting itself a scarf was recirculated on social media around April Fools' Day in 2019:   This image had already been online for several years by then. In April 2016, for example, it was posted on the website \"Top Crochet Patterns\" along with a fictional \"Breaking News\" story about a knitting gorilla named Penny who was resident at a national zoo: Top Crochet Patterns BREAKING NEWS! A gorilla has been discovered knitting at a national zoo, leading to new questions regarding ape intellects and their capability to grasp math. After a crafty staff member accidentally left balls of yarn, needles, and the latest copy of LGC (Let's Get Crafting Magazine) in the gorilla enclosure, zookeepers were stunned to find that resident gorilla Penny had successfully managed to cast on and knit half a scarf. Even managing to swap between colours, these incredible abilities have suddenly attracted the attentions of scientists across the globe. The discovery will no doubt be apeeling to the debate of how intelligent gorillas are. This is not a genuine photograph of a knitting gorilla, nor is this a genuine news story. And, to top it off, this gorilla's name is not Penny. The image of a gorilla knitting is a manipulated version of a photograph taken at the London Zoo in 2009. At the time, zookeepers were awaiting the arrival of a new gorilla, Yeboah, a 12-year-old male who was being transferred from a zoo in France. In order to prepare the three female inhabitants for the change, the zookeepers handed out photographic posters of their potential new mate. The original undoctored photograph showed a gorilla named Mjukuu, or \"Jookie,\" examining one of the posters. The image appeared in a 2009 article published by CNN entitled \"Girl gorillas go ape for French pinup hunk\": photograph article You don't want to monkey around on a blind date, especially if your friends are also taking an interest in the same dark, handsome stranger. So when three female gorillas at London Zoo heard that they would soon be visited by a brooding French hunk -- well, they went a bit bananas. The latest development in Anglo-French relations sees Yeboah, a 20-stone 12-year-old, leave his current home at La Boissiere Du Dore Zoo, Pays de la Loire, northwest France and head for the British capital by the end of the year. There he will be greeted by gorilla trio Zaire, Effie and Mjukuu, who were given posters of their prospective boyfriend for the first time Thursday. One female gorilla shrieked in delight, while another wedged the poster in a tree to stare at it. A third, clearly overcome by emotion, held the photo close to her chest -- then ate it. Their reception was somewhat unsurprising. The zoo has been without a male gorilla since the demise of Bobby, a silverback, in December.

        "justification": " Claim:  Photograph shows the arrest of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, October 2014] \nThere's a photo doing the rounds on social media tonight purported showing Kim Jong-un under arrest. One version shows blurred-out faces, and blood on KJU's face.\n\n   Origins:  On 9 October 2014, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un missed an important state celebration in the country's capital of Pyongyang. The leader's absence marked a full five weeks since his last public appearance on 3 September 2014, increasing  speculation on social media sites and in the press that Kim Jong-un had been quietly deposed. TIME magazine reported Kim's of absence from the public eye that: \n\nKim was last seen at a Sept. 3 concert, ensconced in a red easy chair next to his wife, Ri Sol Ju. Late [that] month, the youthful marshal was a no-show at a meeting of North Korea's rubber-stamp legislature. The cloistered nation's state-run TV aired images of his seat at parliament  empty. Rumors began flying as the disappearance ran into weeks that Kim was either dying or had been deposed.\n\n Kim was also limping during his last public appearance, ABC News noted, lending credence to rumors that the leader was in poor health dispute his relative youth: \n\nOne factor that makes Kim Jong-un's ongoing absence different from the rest of the dictatorial pack is his age. Though his health is clearly a cause for concern  since he has grown noticeably larger and was seen limping in his last public appearance  his age makes the prospect of a grave medical issue less of a concern.\n\n John Delury of Yonsei University in Seoul explained that rumors like those swirling about regarding Kim Jung-un's absence are easy to believe due to the state's distance from world affairs: \n\nIf there had been regicide or revolt in Pyongyang, it's unlikely the wheels of North Korean diplomacy would spin like business as usual. These episodes [like Kim's absence] reveal as much about us as them  our own assumptions, even obsessions, when it comes to North Korea. We assume North Korea must be on the brink of collapse, so when the young leader suspends his relentless 'onsite guidance visits' for a few weeks, we assume he's been overthrown. Precisely because we have fewer sources of reliable, direct information about North Korea, it pays not to rush to judgment.\n\n Given the secrecy with which the North Korean \"hermit kingdom\" conducts its business, the idea of a coup or another mysterious unpleasant circumstance befalling Kim Jong-un did not appear implausible to social media users. The following image began to circulate on social media sites, prompting additional speculation that Kim Jong-un had been taken into custody by North Korean officials:  However, that image was an altered one  a reverse image search revealed a nearly identical picture of Kim Jong-un in the same pose taken nearly three years earlier:  The second, unaltered image, is a Korean Central News Agency photo showing the North Korean leader's visit to Unit 671 of the Korean People's Army (KPA) in January 2012, where he \"waved back to the enthusiastically cheering service personnel\" before having his picture taken with an escorted of grinning military officials.  Someone doctored that photo to add blood and bruises to Kim's face and blur out the smiling countenances of his escort, making it appear that Kim had been roughed up and arrested by grim-faced soldiers. visit \n\n\n\n  Last updated:  10 October 2014\n    Keneally, Meghan.  \"Kim Jong-Un Isn't The First Dictator to Go Missing.\"\n   ABC News.  10 October 2014.\n",

            "A prototype anti-rape device was fashioned as a female condom with teeth lining the inside."
        ],
        "justification": "In 2012, internet users began forwarding a description of a South African anti-rape device known as Rapex: Sonette Ehlers, of South Africa (the rape capital of the world), has invented an anti-rape device that goes by the name, Rapex. The device is basically a female condom with teeth lining the inside that work just like the protective spikes in a parking garage You can go in, but whatever you do, dont back out. The teeth are angled so they allow penetration, but bite like a shark as the penis is removed; supposedly causing so much pain that it will give the woman a chance to escape. Further, according to Ms. Ehlers, \"the device will need to be surgically removed at a hospital, which will lead to the capture of the rapist.\" \n The device shown above is a prototype for an anti-rape female condom which was unveiled in 2005, as designed by Sonnet Ehlers, a former medical technician in South Africa. Originally branded RapeX, the device's identification was changed to Rape-aXe due to a conflict with the European Union's warning system of similar name. warning system Various news article reported of the device's introduction that: \"Nothing has ever been done to help a woman so that she does not get raped and I thought it was high time,\" Sonette Ehlers, 57, said of the \"rapex\", a device worn like a tampon that has sparked controversy in a country used to daily reports of violent crime. Ehlers said the \"rapex\" hooks onto the rapist's skin, allowing the victim time to escape and helping to identify perpetrators. \"He will obviously be too preoccupied at this stage,\" she told reporters. \"I promise you he is going to be too sore. He will go straight to\nhospital.\" The device, made of latex and held firm by shafts of sharp barbs, can only be removed from the man through surgery which will alert hospital staff, and ultimately, the police, she said. Once it lodges, only a doctor can remove it  a procedure Ehlers hopes will be done with authorities on standby to make an arrest.\n\"It hurts, he cannot pee and walk when it's on,\" she said. \"If he tries to remove it, it will clasp even tighter ... however, it doesn't break the skin, and there's no danger of fluid exposure.\" It also reduces the chances of a woman falling pregnant or contracting AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases from the attacker by acting in the same way as a female condom. \"The ideal situation would be for a woman to wear this when she's going out on some kind of blind date ... or to an area she's not comfortable with,\" she said. Ehlers, who showed off a prototype, said women had tried it for comfort and it had been tested on a plastic male model but not yet on a live man. Production was planned to start [in 2006]. However, even though the the Rape-aXe anti-rape condom was promoted online and announced as about to go into production eleven years ago, we've found no indication that it has ever been marketed to the public nor any announcement confirming if or when it will be made available for purchase. CNN reported in 2010 that Ehlers planned to distribute 30,000 of the devices in South Africa during the upcoming World Cup football matches and hoped to make them available for sale after a \"trial period,\" but we have found no report suggesting that the product has ever been released to vendors. promoted distribute In January 2017, a GoFundMe campaign was launched with a stated goal of continuing to develop a Rape-aXe product and bring it to market.

After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar, but never worked as an attorney. As a venture-capitalist, Romney's first major business deal involved investing in a start-up office supply company with one store in Massachusetts that sold office supplies. That company, called Staples, now has over 2,000 stores and employs over 90,000 people. Romney or his company Bain Capital (using what became known as the \"Bain Way\") would go on to perform the same kinds of business miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many others.

Unpaid bishop and stake president for his church 10 years. No salary as president of the Olympics 3 years. No salary as MA governor 4 years. That's a grand total of 28 years of unpaid service to his country, his community and his church. Why? Because that's the kind of man Mitt Romney is!

Most of the information contained therein is verifiable, as described below: \nAfter going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar, but never worked as an attorney.\n\n   In the 1970s, Mitt Romney attended Harvard University and earned a degree from the school's then-new joint business and law degree program.  According to a 2007 Boston Globe profile: \n\nGeorge Romney loomed large in his son's decision to earn business and law degrees simultaneously. Intent on following in the professional footsteps of his father, who had been chairman of American Motors Corp., Romney expressed an interest in business school. George Romney believed a law degree was a valuable commodity. So his son pursued both. Harvard's joint MBA/JD program was relatively new at the time  it had been launched two years earlier  and was intensely rigorous. Typically, business school is completed in two years and law school in three; dual-degree students earn both degrees in four years, spending their first year at one of the schools, their second at the other, and their final two shuttling between both. Out of Romney's 800 business school classmates and 550 law school classmates, only 15 earned degrees through the dual program. Romney excelled at both schools, graduating with honors from the law school; becoming a Baker Scholar at the business school, a distinction reserved for the top 5 percent of the class; and impressing many of his peers with his quick mind and skill at building consensus.\n The biography The Real Romney notes that: \n\nShortly after Romney left Harvard, he began working at BCG [Boston Consulting Group], a fitting first job for a freshly minted Ivy League graduate. Romney was hedging his bets, though, not wholly confident that he would make it in the business world. He passed the Michigan bar exam in July 1975 and was admitted to practice law there the next year.  He figured it would provide him a landing place if he didn't cut it in business. But the safety valve wouldn't be necessary.\n \nAs a venture-capitalist, Romney's first major business deal involved investing in a start-up office supply company with one store in Massachusetts that sold office supplies. That company, called Staples, now has over 2,000 stores and employs over 90,000 people. Romney or his company Bain Capital (using what became known as the \"Bain Way\") would go on to perform the same kinds of business miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many others.\n\n   The long-term effectiveness (or lack thereof) of the so-called \"Bain Way\" remains a subject of debate.  In January 2012, the Wall Street Journal published an analysis of the business investments made by Bain Capital during Mitt Romney's tenure there and reported the following: \n\nThe Wall Street Journal, aiming for a comprehensive assessment, examined 77 businesses Bain invested in while Mr. Romney led the firm from its 1984 start until early 1999, to see how they fared during Bain's involvement and shortly afterward. Among the findings: 22% either filed for bankruptcy reorganization or closed their doors by the end of the eighth year after Bain first invested, sometimes with substantial job losses. An additional 8% ran into so much trouble that all of the money Bain invested was lost. Another finding was that Bain produced stellar returns for its investors  yet the bulk of these came from just a small number of its investments. Ten deals produced more than 70% of the dollar gains. Some of those companies, too, later ran into trouble. Of the 10 businesses on which Bain investors scored their biggest gains, four later landed in bankruptcy court.\n\n (Full details of the Wall Street Journal's analysis can be viewed here.) here \nVolunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign 1 year.\n\n   A 2007 Time magazine article touched on a teenaged Mitt Romney's working for his father's Michigan gubernatorial campaign in 1962: \n\nHe was 15 when his father ran for Governor in a state in which no Republican had held the job in 14 years. Mitt worked the campaign switchboard and traveled the county-fair circuit in a Ford microvan. George put Mitt to work at the \"Romney for Governor\" booths, shouting over a microphone and loudspeaker system, \"You should vote for my father for Governor. He's a truly great person. You've got to support him. He's going to make things better.\" Mitt realizes now that his dad had something in mind beyond his own political career: \"He was teaching me how to get out there.\"\n\n \nUnpaid intern in Governor's office 8 years.\n\n   Mitt Romney did work as an intern in the Michigan governor's office while his father held that position, but not for anything close to eight years. George Romney served as Michigan's governor for only six years (January 1963 to January 1969), and for most of that time Mitt Romney was living outside of the state: first as a student at Stanford University in California from 1965-66, then as a Mormon missionary in France from mid-1966 through the end of 1968. \nMormon missionary in Paris 2 years.\n\n   Mitt Romney served as a Mormon missionary in France for a thirty-month period from July 1966 to December 1968.  In 2007 the New York Times reported of his experience there that: \n\nFrance was a humbling experience for Mr. Romney, who recalled it as the only time in his life when most of what I was trying to do was rejected. Missionary work is a rite of passage for Mormon men, who are encouraged to volunteer when they turn 19. Mitt Romneys grandfather, father and older brother had all served in Britain, so his assignment to France came as a surprise, he recalled. The son of a car company chief executive who later became governor of Michigan, Mitt Romney called his mission an instructive first experience of deprivation. He lived on about $100 a month, sleeping on cast-off mattresses and crowding into small apartments in groups of four. The only toilet was often down the hall and the only shower in a public bathhouse.  The 175 missionaries in France all rose at 6 a.m. each day, rang doorbells from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and turned in by 10.  Mr. Romney quickly stood out. His father was perhaps the best known Mormon public official of his day, and Mitts three years of French at the exclusive Cranbrook school in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., had made him more fluent than his peers.  Like most missionaries, he did not win many converts. After reading Mitts demoralized letters, his father sent back a favorite motto: Despair not, but if you despair, work on in your despair. Mr. Romneys companions, though, recall only his zeal. In newsletters, he often led the lists recording contacts made or tracts distributed. He chafed at the door-to-door entreaties, pushing for new ways to market their creed, like an exhibition baseball game or staging an American night in a youth center.\n\n \nUnpaid bishop and stake president for his church 10 years.\n\n   The authors of The Real Romney described Mitt's service as a bishop and stake president in his church: \n\nMormon congregations, typically groups of 400 to 500 people, are known as wards, and their boundaries are determined by geography. Wards, along with smaller congregations known as branches, are organized into stakes. Thus a stake, akin to a Catholic diocese, is a collection of wards and branches in a city or region. Unlike Protestants or Catholics, Mormons do not choose the congregations to which they belong. It depends entirely on where they live. In another departure from many other faiths, Mormons do not have paid full-time clergy. Members in good standing take turns serving in leadership roles. They are expected to perform their ecclesiastical duties on top of career and family responsibilities. Those called to serve as stake presidents and bishops, or leaders of local wards, are fully empowered as agents of the church, and they carry great authority over their domains. Mitt Romney first took on a major church role around 1977, when he was called to be a counselor to Gordon Williams, then the president of the Boston stake. Romney was essentially an adviser and deputy to Williams, helping oversee area congregations. His appointment was somewhat unusual in that counselors at that level have typically been bishops of their local wards first. But Romney, who was only about 30 years old, was deemed to possess leadership qualities beyond his years. Romneys responsibilities only grew from there; he would go on to serve as bishop and then as stake president, overseeing about a dozen congregations with close to 4,000 members altogether. Those positions in the church amounted to his biggest leadership test yet, exposing him to personal and institutional crises, human tragedies, immigrant cultures, social forces, and organizational challenges that he had never before encountered.\n\n \nNo salary as president of the Olympics 3 years.\n\n   Mitt Romney served as the president and CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002. According to his spokesman, Romney donated the salary and severance pay he received for that effort to charity: \n\nIn Romney's case, he signed an offer letter in 1999 acknowledging he would be paid $280,000 annually for the Olympic job and receive up to one year in severance pay after the Games. Romney announced the day he started the job that he would not accept any wages unless the organizing committee completed the Games with a profit. He also told the Salt Lake Tribune one of his \"absolutes\" was that he would \"not accept any severance pay when his three-year term is complete.\" He also cited his pledge to forgo any severance pay in his book, \"Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership, and the Olympic Games.\" When the organizing committee posted a surplus of nearly $100 million after the Games, Romney accepted $922,980 in total salary as well as the $476,000 severance package. [His spokesman, Eric] Fehrnstrom said Romney gave his salary as well as the severance pay to charity. Romney and his wife, Ann, also donated $1 million to the organizing committee during his tenure. Asked what charities received the money, Fehrnstrom said Romney does not discuss publicly his charitable giving.\n\n \nNo salary as MA governor 4 years.\n\n   Just prior to his swearing-in as Massachusetts' governor in 2003, Mitt Romney's transition team announced that he and his lieutenant governor would not take salaries ($135,000 and $120,000 per year, respectively) while in office. \nAnd in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost 19% of his income.  Obama gave 1% Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%\n\n   According to an in-process federal income tax return made available by the Romney campaign, in 2011 Mitt and Ann Romney declared a gross income of $20,908,880 and charitable contributions of $4,020,572, the latter figure comprising 19.2% of the former.   tax return The additional information about the charitable donations of President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden is incorrect, however.  In 2011 the Obamas reported a\ngross income of $844,585 and charitable contributions totaling $172,130, the latter figure comprising 20.4% of the former (a rate higher than the Romneys' 19.2%).

The picture supposedly showed a woman named Aracely Henriquez, along with the false claim that Floyd once \"brutally\" assaulted her in a robbery. started to circulate   This is not a picture of Henriquez. Before we explain, we should note the police encounter that resulted in Floyd's death in May 2020 began with a report about a counterfeit $20 bill passed at a store, not with an arrest warrant or an investigation into Floyd's alleged criminal history. report Furthermore, the claims made in this meme are either exaggerated or outright fabricated. While Floyd was indeed arrested for his involvement in a home robbery in 2007 (we conducted a detailed analysis of Floyd's criminal record, including the robbery from 2007, in this article), no evidence suggests that Henriquez was pregnant, or that Floyd threatened to kill her baby. Henriquez was injured during the incident, though the police report says the injuries were inflicted by another man, not Floyd. But the above-displayed image does not illustrate the extent of her injuries because the picture isn't of her.  this article This is actually a photograph of Andrea Sicignano, a student who was reportedly assaulted and raped in Madrid in 2018. Sicignano posted these images of herself to her Facebook page, along with a message detailing her attack. The Spanish news outlet El Pais reported: reported A 27-year-old student living in Madrid was attacked and raped by a man two weekends ago close to the bus station in the Aluche neighborhood in the south of the capital, according to sources from police headquarters. Andrea Sicignano, who has been living in Madrid for the past six months, described via a public post on her Facebook account what happened to her as she returned home from a night out with a friend. [...] \"Its unclear exactly what happened next, but as soon as I started to realize I could be in danger, I tried to leave. But this man became forceful and violent towards me,\" she goes on. \"As I fought, he started to beat me. I was screaming and fighting with all of the power I could muster. I desperately tried to reach for my phone but he called out in Spanish, I have your phone, you can't call anyone. [...] \"I was sure he was going to kill me,\" she continues. Eventually I closed my eyes. With the hope that he would stop beating me, I pretended to be dead. I prayed that when I opened my eyes he would be gone. I dont know how much time passed before I finally opened my eyes, but when I did, he had disappeared. Finally, she writes: He raped me. In short, the above-displayed meme truly features a photograph of a woman who was brutally assaulted. The woman depicted, however, is not Henriquez, and the assault described in the meme is in no way connected to Floyd. This meme also misstates, exaggerates, and fabricates details about Floyd's 2007 robbery arrest.

        "justification": " Claim:  U.S. postage stamps may not be resold for a price greater than their face value. FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, October 2007] \nI was always under the impression that selling a regular US First-Class stamp for profit was illegal. I thought you could only sell it for face value, is this true?\n\n   Origins:  These days postal customers have a multiplicity of options for buying postage: They can purchase stamps not only at post offices but also from private mailbox chain outlets and from many grocery, warehouse, and convenience stores; they can order stamps by phone, through the mail, or over the Internet; and they can even print out postage stamps themselves through programs operated by authorized U.S. Postal Service (USPS) vendors.  It wasn't all that long ago, however, when many customers had few (if any) alternatives for obtaining stamps other than by trekking down to the local post office.  It might be memories from those  days  when the U.S. Post Office Department was strictly a government agency (i.e., prior to the creation of the USPS in 1970) and its offices were the only sales outlet for stamps for many people  that have fostered the mistaken belief it is illegal to re-sell U.S. postage stamps for a price greater than their face value.  Perhaps people viewed postage stamps as a type of government service, and therefore they thought making a\nprofit from the resale of stamps was a form of illegal profiteering.   We know this not to be true from anecdotal evidence: Years ago, one of the few sources of stamps other than the post office was the mechanical, lever-operated  machines commonly found in grocery stores which dispensed individual stamps (rather than booklets) and were notorious for not providing full value  depositing a dime in such a machine would typically fetch the customer something like one five-cent stamp and two one-cent stamps, or a quarter might buy three six-cent stamps and one three-cent stamp.  Even today, the private mailbox outlets that have sprung up across the country often add surcharges to the price of stamps they offer their customers as a convenience.  (Plus, if selling stamps for more than their face value were truly prohibited by law, then all philatelic sales of uncancelled stamps would be illegal.) In any case, we don't need to rely on anecdotal evidence, because the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section of the USPS's web site explains that it has no control over the prices other entities charge for reselling U.S. postage stamps: FAQ \n\nSelling stamps at a higher price The Postal Service sells stamps at face value to everyone. We have no control over the pricing policies of private entrepreneurs, companies or agencies who resell our products. A charge at a higher price is most likely imposed to earn a return on their investment of capital and effort. The prices they charge are, no doubt, established on the basis of their needs and market evaluations. Customers may avoid paying more than the stated value for First-Class Mail postage by purchasing stamps at their Post Office, through Stamps By Mail, phone, online, Automated Postal Centers and retail outlets that are involved with our consignment programs or from one of the many postal stores.\n Last updated:  19 August 2013\n ",

FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, September 2010] \nKrystal, is a PA working in a Laywer's office in Windhoek. Two months ago she went to an upmarket hair salon on Independence avenue and spent well over $1500 for a Brazilian weave.  She looked good in her new hair style! Two weeks later she started suffering severe headaches that would not go away with compral. Frequently she'd wake up at night with the constant headache. She went to a private doctor who gave her myprodols that would work for only a few hours and then the headaches will be back worse than before. Desperate she went to see a specialist who did blood tests and even a scan of the brain and all the tests were normal.  Because of the headaches she could not concentrate at work and was sleeping very poorly. she went back to her doctor who decided to examine her scalp and under the beautiful weave he found worms! The worms were burrowing into her skull and after sending the samples to the lab they found that the hair had eggs from which the worms had hatched! The doctor told her that the hair was probably from a corpse because the kind of worms are usually found on dead bodies! The hairdresser who supplied the hair was shocked and told her that they fitted 10 weaves already and that batch of hair had gone very fast! If you have a weave and getting constant headaches, this is something you may consider checking out. Poor krystal had to shave her head after this ordeal and take antibiotics for a full 2 weeks! Lesson: ladies we should be careful with what we put on our heads, it is better to appreciate our natural beauty and be content with what God has blessed us with than to chase artificial beauty. If you know a sister you care about who may benefit from this message, pls. spread it.\n Origins:  This sorrowful (but fictional) tale about a hair weave that led to its wearer's scalp being attacked by worms began circulating on the Internet in early September 2010. We've so far picked up four versions, the most recent an October 2013 retelling of the legend that was published in a Kenyan newspaper, picked up and run as a straight news report by a Nigerian Independent Reporters TV Media site, then published as fact by the UK's Daily Mail.  Each version changes the name of the woman said to have received the contaminated weave, the city she works in, and/or the location of the hair salon, but otherwise leaves the text of the tale largely untouched: retelling news report Daily Mail \nKrystal, is a PA working in a Laywer's office in Windhoek. Two months ago she went to an upmarket hair salon on Independence avenue and spent well over $1500 for a Brazilian weave.\n \n My friend Laimi, is a PA working in a Laywer's office in Windhoek. Two months ago she went to an upmarket hair salon on Independence avenue and spent well over $1500 for a Brazilian weave.\n \n My friend Irene, is a PA working in a Lawyer's office in Westlands. Two months ago she went to an upmarket hair salon on Kenyatta avenue and spent well over 1500 for a weave.\n \n Irene Myangoh, a personal assistant working at a law firm in Nairobi went to an upmarket hair salon along Kenyatta Avenue, and spent more than N5,500 on a human hair weave.\n (Myprodols is a painkiller vended in Africa which is used to treat mild to moderate pain. Compral is an over-the-counter painkiller comparable to aspirin.) All four versions place the incident in Africa: Windhoek is the capital of Namibia, a country in southwestern Africa; Nairobi is the capital and largest city of the east African country of Kenya; and Westlands (which does indeed have a Kenyatta Avenue) is an affluent neighbourhood in the city of Nairobi.  A Brazilian weave (which is not to be confused with a Brazilian blowout, a treatment performed in a salon whereby the customer's own hair is chemically de-frizzed) is constructed of hair extensions made from human hair. The customer's own tresses are first worked into cornrows, which then serve as the platform onto which the extensions are sewn. The resulting \"weave\" sits atop the recipient's own hair, somewhat akin to a wig that's been sewn into place. The procedure takes between four and five hours to complete, and prices in the $1,000 to $2,000 range are not unheard of. The tale of the contaminated hair weave is long on gruesomeness and variable details but short on checkable facts. While the victim's first name is always provided (depending on the version one receives, she's Krystal, Laimi, or Irene), her surname rarely is. Likewise, while the account  always says she's a personal assistant at a lawyer's office, the name of the lawyer or firm that employs her is not given. The salon where the manky hair was installed is described only as an \"upmarket hair salon\" on a street that's either Independence or Kenyatta, which is in a city that's either in Namibia or Kenya, two countries the entire width of Africa apart. The results described are also impossible. Popular belief to the contrary, human corpses are not riddled with worms. Rather, once people die, their bodies very quickly attract the attention of a number of species of flies, which (among other activities) lay their eggs on the deceased.  The \"worms\" one sometimes sees on corpses are actually maggots, the just-hatched offspring of such flies.  Human hair intended for weaves, hair pieces, or wigs is carefully washed, sorted, and matched with tresses of similar color and texture very early in the process of turning it into a fashion accessory. Ergo, even if the hair used had been taken from a corpse and had through that association become infested with fly eggs, those future larvae (\"worms\") would have been washed away by the first cleaning given those strands during the sorting process. The hair weave tale combines three urban legends into one. From the \"poisoned  dress\" legend, it draws the element of an item taken from a corpse (a dress in one story, hair in the other) transmitting some manner of horribleness (formaldehyde or worms) to the next wearer. From the \"necrophiliac lover\" legend comes the plot device of a doctor's running tests on the maggots, thereby discovering that the hair used in the weave had come from a dead person. Tying it all together is the \"fatal hairdo\" legend, wherein a gal's unwashed bouffant hair style becomes the home for venomous spiders that serve to punish both her vanity and lack of attention to matters of personal hygiene.  dress maggots spiders There are numerous meanings to the hair weave tale, two of which are contained in its closing: \"Lesson: ladies we should be careful with what we put on our heads, it is better to appreciate our natural beauty and be content with what God has blessed us with than to chase artificial beauty.\" First, the story is one of caveat emptor, a \"buyer beware\" tale wherein a woman comes by her headful of maggots via opting for the latest, greatest hair treatment. In that light, it's meant to impress upon us, its audience, that we never truly know what goes into consumer products and thus should exercise care in our choices. Second, the story is one that decries vanity, in this instance by portraying a gal who disregards the \"better to be happy with what we have\" dictum in favor of an enormously expensive beauty adjunct as paying for her narcissism in gruesome fashion. Vanity is further highlighted as evil by the audience's awareness that if the woman had been able to wash her own hair (which she couldn't, because it was under the weave), those fly eggs would have been long gone well before they had turned into \"worms\" that started chomping on her. Xenophobia also comes into play, as the hair used in Brazilian weaves generally comes from abroad: by portraying the imported tresses as maggot-laden and dangerous, ongoing suspicion about things which come from other countries and cultures is aired. Last, the story reflects our unease with the dead. Barbara \"the unsweet hair-after\" Mikkelson Last updated:  31 October 2013  ",

        "justification": "Resentment toward President Donald Trump's treatment of Latino communities resurfaced again when an image began circulating online of a poster purportedly \"all over\" Puerto Rico to coincide with the president's October 2017 visit there. The image shows a white poster with Trump's face atop the word \"PENDEJO\" -- a Spanish-language slang term for an idiot.   Some variations of the picture include the caption: PUERTO RICO SALUTES TRUMP ...\nTHESE ARE POSTED ALL OVER THE ISLAND ... The president received harsh criticism for his response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in September 2017. Following his visit to Puerto Rico on 3 October 2017, during which he was seen throwing paper towels into a crowd of people, Carmen Yuln Cruz, mayor of the capital city of San Juan, said: criticism The terrible and abominable view of him throwing paper towels and throwing provisions of people, it does not embody the spirit of the American nation. However, the \"pendejo\" photograph does not contain any information identifying it as having been taken in Puerto Rico. According to the Puerto Rican government, only 10 percent of Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority customers (PREPA) had electricity restored as of 6 October 2017, so it is unclear who could make and distribute a poster \"all over\" the territory. We are also skeptical that as Puerto Ricans face an uncertain future with a scarcity of food, water, electricity, and phone service, they have the resources and energy to launch an island-wide \"pendejo\" poster campaign. According If the image was taken on the island territory, and if there are indeed \"pendejo\" posters all over the island, it would not be surprising if they predate both the hurricane and Trump's visit. Snake Hawk Press, which is based out of San Antonio, Texas, has been selling the posters since at least September 2016 (and currently offers both a print and a t-shirt). The studio's owner, Cruz Ortiz, also created artwork for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign. T-shirt retailer Crazy Saguaro Tees also sells a shirt with the image. print t-shirt created retailer Crazy Saguaro Tees told us that they did not create the image. We reached out to Snake Hawk Press seeking comment, but did not receive a response by press time. Calling Trump a \"pendejo\" is not exactly a novel idea. Shortly after he announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in June 2015, a Guatemala-based company, Ilegal Mezcal, circulated posters in various U.S. cities with a picture of Trump's head alongside the message: circulated DONALD ERES UN PENDEJO\nFROM ILEGAL MEZCAL This photograph was taken by a Snopes staff member in Washington, DC, in September 2016: \n \n Ilegal Mezcal founder John Rexer said in 2015: We're putting them up as long as Trump continues to be an ass. So probably we'll be doing it for a while. After Trump pardoned former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio on 25 August 2017 from a conviction for racially profiling Latinos in defiance of a federal judge's order, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julin Castro responded to Trump's decision on Twitter saying: pardoned responded Trump in one word tonight:\n#pendejo Trump campaigned for the presidency on the promise that he would build a \"wall\" between the United States and Mexico. While announcing his candidacy on 16 June 2015 he said: said: When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

            "Was the town of Paradise, California, named for the 'Pair-o-Dice' saloon?"
        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  The town of Paradise, California, was named after the \"Pair o' Dice\" saloon. LEGEND Origins:  The abundance of place names in the U.S. (and other parts of the world) that incorporate the word \"paradise\" hardly needs explaning.  One can well imagine settlers coming across new areas offering some combination of pleasantly  temperate weather, bountifully fertile soil, and gorgeous natural scenery, and deciding that such places truly deserved names reflective\nof their appearances as little bits of heaven on Earth.  (Upon occasion, the name \"Paradise\" has also been applied derisively to some strikingly inhospitable geographic locations.)  In California alone, one can find a Paradise Craggy, Paradise Dam, Paradise Cay, and of course a town named Paradise. Paradise, California  a town in Butte County, about 80 miles north of the state capital of Sacramento  lives up to its designation about as much as  any other similarly-named place.  Located in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, its altitude (about 1,700 feet) positions it high enough to escape the valley heat in the summer, yet low enough to stay below the heavy winter snowfalls that crest the mountain range.  The climate and soil are agreeable for growing a variety of  vegetables, fruits, and nuts crops, leading Paradise to once possess the title of \"the apple center of California.\" Despite the obvious appropriateness of its name, a legend nonetheless persists that Paradise, a Gold Rush-era town, was so named not because it resembled Eden, but because it was home to the Pair o' Dice saloon.  This claim is bolstered by the fact that an official railroad map printed in 1900 rendered the town's name as 'Paradice.'  Was the saloon really the origin of the name, or was the map entry simply a misspelling that in turn prompted a legend about a saloon? The case for the Pair o' Dice tale is rather weak: No evidence documents the existence of a drinkery by that name in the area, much less explains how the town came to be named for such an establishment or how the unusual spelling came about.  Gene Sylva, a former mayor of the nearby town of Oroville, California, and a past president of the Butte County Historical Society, has asserted that the \"saloon\" story is bunk and offered an alternate explanation: \n\n[Sylva's] great-great-grandfather, William Pierce Leonard, named this popular retirement town on a summer day in 1864, after a hot and dusty ride up from the Sacramento Valley. The crew of his sawmill was outside taking a break when he arrived. Leonard, who was affectionately known as \"Uncle Billy,\" dismounted his horse, took a deep breath of the cool, clean air, and exclaimed, \"Boys, this is paradise.\"\n\n The story about \"Uncle Billy\" might also be a bit of pleasingly inventive historical fiction, but lacking any more evidence either way, we'd have to agree with William of Occam that the simpler explanation should be preferred, and Paradise was probably so named merely because it was a pleasant place to live.

Fisherman Stalin and his wife Jesurani, who use only one name, ran for safety carrying their baby when the tsunamis hit their coastal village in the Colachel area of Tamil Nadu state.  In a similar tale of hope overcoming despair, a woman in Port Blair, capital of India's Andaman and Nicobar islands, also named her prematurely born boy Tsunami.1\n About the same  time as the reports of tsunami-named children came an item, picked up by Reuters from a Romanian publication and carried by hundreds of news outlets throughout the English-speaking world, that a couple had named their newborn child 'Yahoo' (after the popular web portal) out of gratitude for having been brought together through the Internet: web portal \n\nA Romanian couple named their son Yahoo as a sign of gratitude for meeting over the Internet, a Bucharest newspaper said Thursday. Daily Libertatea said Cornelia and Nonu Dragoman, both from Transylvania, met and decided they were meant for each other following a three-month relationship over the net. They married and had a baby this Christmas, whom they decided to name after one of the worldwide web's most popular portals. \"We named him Lucian Yahoo after my father and the net, the main beacon of my life,\" Cornelia Dragoman was quoted as saying.2\n Ten days later came the correction: There was no such couple; the story had been invented by an overzealous reporter: \n\nA Romanian tabloid says it has fired a reporter for making up a story about a couple who named their son Yahoo as a sign of gratitude for meeting over the Internet. Earlier this month, major Bucharest daily Libertatea published a story saying two Romanians had named their baby Yahoo and printed a picture of his birth certificate. The news was widely picked up on the Internet. \"It was the reporter's child's birth certificate, which he modified,\" said Simona Ionescu, Libertatea's deputy editor-in-chief on Monday. \"We fired him.\" She said Ion Garnod, who had worked for the paper for several years, had admitted inventing the story to look good.3\n Last updated:  25 January 2005\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   1.

        "justification": "As a polar vortex caused temperatures to plummet in many areas of the North America in January 2019, a set of cute photographs purportedly showing a bird (variously described as a goose or a duck) helping to keep a puppy warm circulated on social media. The most popular posting of these photographs (which garnered more than 235,000 shares within a week) was accompanied by a brief piece of text supposedly explaining the back story of the images: polar vortex posting \n  A man finds a goose that was shaking with cold stuck to a pole in Montana. When approaching, the surprise is capital. The goose was sheltering with her wings a puppy that was about to die frozen. We have so much to learn as a species ... These images appear to be real. However, they weren't taken recently, we've found no evidence that either animal was \"stuck to a pole,\" and we're skeptical that these photographs were snapped in Montana (or anywhere in the United States). These photographs have been circulating on Chinese social media sites and news platforms, such as Weibo and Toutiao, since 2017. The earliest posting that we could uncover came from March of 2017 in a blog post on the Chinese news platform NetEase. Weibo Toutiao The accompanying story (roughly translated via Google) relayed a similar message to the viral Facebook post. According to NetEase, the dog was shivering on the side of the road when it was by encountered a group of ducks. The mother duck then put the pup under its arms in order to keep it warm: NetEase The puppy was shivering coldly on the side of the road. Even the passing ducks couldnt see it. But one puppy ran straight at the puppy and hugged it to keep it warm. When the dog was hugged by the duck, it did not struggle and was safely taken in the duck's arms. It can be seen that the ducks have more love, and that mother love is great. In the care of the mother duck, the puppy no longer has to be afraid of being cold, and only this kind of particularly caring duck mother will do this. The average animal will not be like this for children who are not their own. A note at the bottom of this story states that NetEase allows users to post their own content, and that the story solely represents the words of the author. In other words, no verification process takes place. The story published to Netease didn't provide many specifics about the photographs (such as where they were taken), and we haven't been able to find any previous reports about them. While we can't say for sure what these pictures capture, they have been circulating online on Chinese social media sites since at least 2017 and were most likely taken somewhere in that country. The superfluous claim about the duck's being \"stuck to a post\" was added after the fact and appears to have been invented in an attempt to raise the stakes (and shareability) of this content. Although the back story behind these particular photographs may be unclear, it isn't unprecedented for birds and dogs to strike up friendships.

(Other Muslim countries in the Middle East are not so restrictive of Christianity and other non-Muslim religions.) prohibition Discontent with this situation has prompted the online spread of tropes and memes along the lines of \"We'll accept Muslims/mosques here when they allow Bibles/churches in Saudi Arabia\":  But one meme has taken this concept a step further, asserting that the country of Poland actually enacted a legal ban on mosques there until such time as Christian churches are allowed in Saudi Arabia:  It is true that the construction of mosques has met with opposition over the last several years in Catholic-predominant Poland: construction In a sight familiar in some west European countries but new to Poland, dozens of protesters demonstrated in a Warsaw suburb against the construction of a mosque. Plans by Polands tiny Muslim community to build a place of worship and an Islamic cultural center face opposition in a sign that concerns about Islam may be spreading eastwards to the staunchly Catholic European Union member. Between 15,000 and 30,000 Muslims, many of them immigrants from Chechnya, live in Poland  the biggest ex-communist EU state where more than 90 percent of the 38-million population declare themselves Catholics. However, mosques do in fact exist in Poland, and searches of legislation and news reports turn up no reference to any legal ban on the existence or construction of mosques within Poland. mosques legislation news reports This meme appears to be based not on reality, but on a viewpoint represented by Dominik Tarczyski, a member of Poland's \"ultraconservative\" Law and Justice Party, who has been quoted as vehemently opposing Poland's acceptance of any non-Christian refugees: \"We don't want Poland being taken over by Muslims, Buddhists, or someone else ... and no one will ever force us to take Muslims, Buddhists, non-believers in huge numbers ... For me, multicultural society, it's not a value ... it's not a virtue. Christian culture, Roman law, Greek philosophers, these are the virtues for us.\" quoted On multiple occasions Tarczyski has voiced his opinion that Poland should not exhibit any more tolerance to Muslims than Saudi Arabia does to Christians: multiple occasions opinion A Polish lawmaker from the ruling Law and Justice Party, Dominik Tarczyski, said that his country will send a clear message to radical Muslims that they cannot claim rights that Europeans lack in Saudi Arabia. Tarczyski drew attention from the Western public in a televised duel with well-known liberal journalist Cathy Newman on the topic of illegal migration when he said that Poland had received a total of zero migrants which he is proud of. He also said that the country was open to peaceful migration and received a large number of Ukrainians. With his attitude that the West is at a very unstable place with the Islamic world currently, Tarczyski claims that there are plans from the theocratic Saudi Arabia to begin mass construction of mosques in the capital of Poland, Warsaw. When asked about the request of the Muslim population in Poland to be allowed to go forward with building mosques, Tarczyski said \"We will be pleased to accept it, right after they allow Poland to build a cathedral in Saudi Arabia.\" A representative of the ruling party pointed out that in Islamic countries there is a significant intolerance towards Christians, and bearing in mind that public wearing or displaying of a cross is forbidden in Saudi Arabia, the same principle should be applied to wearing a burqa in Poland. Nonetheless, Tarczyski's words are reflective of a political viewpoint, not of any actual regulation or policy of his country's government that has barred the construction of any mosques in Poland until churches may be built in Saudi Arabia.

        "justification": "In mid-April 2017, a number of online publications in the U.S. and UK (including the Daily Mail, Fox News, the Inquisitr, Metro, the Mirror, and the Evening Standard) published accounts of a couple who supposedly sought treatment to conceive via IVF, only to discover to their shock that they were biological twins: Daily Mail Fox News Inquisitr Metro Evening Standard A married couple who struggled to conceive only discovered they were twins when they went through IVF. The unnamed couple underwent the treatment to help them have a baby. But doctors at the fertility lab noticed their DNA was abnormally similar. At first, lab technicians believed the pair may be unwitting cousins, but soon ruled that out because the DNA was too similar. Eventually doctors confronted the pair, who burst out in laughter when they were asked if they were related. All of these reports were based on a single source, an article published on 13 April 2017 on the Mississippi Herald web site: article Jackson husband & wife shocked after DNA test reveals they are biological twins A doctor at a fertility clinic in the Mississippi capital of Jackson has made a startling revelation concerning a couple who sought treatment at the center. The married pair, who cannot be named to due to patient confidentiality restrictions, had been struggling to conceive and came to the clinic to take part in the IVF program. During the in vitro fertilization process, we take a DNA sample from both the male and female to get a profile of their genetic backgrounds, the doctor involved told Mississippi Herald, whose name must also be suppressed to protect the identities of the patients. Its just a routine thing, and we wouldnt normally check to see if there was a relationship between the two samples, but in this case the lab assistant involved was shocked by the similarity of each profile. The lab assistant summoned the doctor, who knew almost instantly that the patients must have been related. My first reaction was that they must have been less-closely related; perhaps they were first cousins, which does happen sometimes. However, looking closer at the samples, I noticed there were way too many similarities. The doctor consulted the patients files, and noted with shock that both had the exact same birth dates listed in 1984. With this in mind, I was convinced that both patients were fraternal twins. None of the outlets that republished this story seemed fazed by the fact that the Mississippi Herald report included no verifiable details (such as the byline of the reporter who wrote it, the name of the clinic, the identity of any medical specialist there, or the name of the patients involved). Or that the same site ran a similarly outrageous and non-detailed article about a man who claimed he was sexually seduced by a horse. Or that the Mississippi Herald's web site includes no contact information  no physical address, phone number, or e-mail address  for its office or any of its personnel. Or that there is no such newspaper as the Mississippi Herald (the closest matches are a Biloxi publication called the Mississippi Sun-Herald and Water Valley's small North Mississippi Herald), and the web site purporting to be such only sprang up online a few days before publishing the story referenced above. Or that the story was virtually identical word-for-word (save for the change in locale) to one published by the web site of another non-existent newspaper, the Denver Inquirer, back in December 2016 (also just after that site's establishment): article virtually identical   In short, both the Mississippi Herald and the Denver Inquirer are fake newspaper sites set up for no other ostensible purpose than to spread fictitious stories.

        ],
        "justification": "In early November 2023, hundreds of different online advertisements were displayed to users on Facebook and Instagram that each showed a photo of an Olive Garden restaurant location. At the top of the photos was the word \"CLOSING,\" which was displayed with a red color and capital letters. The two captions of the ads read either \"Say Goodbye To Breadsticks Forever?\" or \"Closing Time: All The Restaurant Chains Closing.\" The ads appeared to hint that there was major news afoot for Olive Garden, possibly that the Italian restaurant chain would be closing all of its locations, going bankrupt or going out of business for other reasons. The ads were appearing on both Facebook and Instagram. All of the ads led to an article on the Investing.com website. The headline of the article read, \"Last Call: These Chain Stores Are Closing Locations in 2023.\" The article listed 216 different businesses, most of which appeared to be American brands. Under each business name were several paragraphs describing whether the companies would be closing some or all of its locations. In other words, there were hundreds of paragraphs in what truly was a massive article. Olive Garden appeared in the story at number 191. That section of the article read as follows: article 191. Olive Garden Year Established: 1982 Store Closures: Over 40 locations Olive Garden has announced the closure of 45 locations nationwide, mainly due to a decline in customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of these Olive Garden locations were smaller, older locations located in California, New York, Pennsylvania and Florida. In addition to this round of closings, the chain is planning to reduce its overall restaurant count by another 40 locations within the next two years. These locations span several states, including Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois and Ohio. All affected employees will receive transition assistance as part of their separation packages from Olive Garden. This closure was met with much sadness by customers who frequented these locations and expressed their fond memories in social media posts and articles. The article did not reveal that the Olive Garden restaurant chain would be closing down. The ads were false clickbait that led to the massive (and possibly outdated) article, as we noted as the top of this fact check. The lengthy article claimed that Olive Garden planned to close 85 of its over 900 locations in the future. To find out more, we contacted Darden Restaurants, the company that owns Olive Garden, to ask about the claim. By email, Jessica Dinon, the company's senior director of communications in social media and creative services, told us, \"Im not sure where the original information came from but I can assure you it is false.\" In our research, we found that Olive Garden was highly profitable for Darden Restaurants, and that the Italian restaurant chain had grown its number of restaurant locations annually over the last several years. Olive Garden locations in the U.S. numbered 858 in 2018, 867 in 2019, 871 in 2020, 877 in 2021, 887 in 2022 and 906 in late 2023, all according to data provided on Darden Restaurants' website. website As for the Facebook and Instagram ads and the Investing.com story, the reason why these kinds of ads and articles exist is usually for something called advertising arbitrage. Advertising arbitrage is a strategy in which an advertiser hopes to make more money on ads displayed in a lengthy article (or slideshow article) than it would cost to display an initial clickbait ad meant to attract users to the article.

        "justification": "Claim:  The U.S. Ambassador to Egypt prevented Marines stationed at the U.S. embassy in Cairo from carrying live ammunition.  FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, September 2012] \nI saw a post on facebook that is claiming that U.S. Marines stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Egypt were not allowed to carry live\nammunition by the U.S. Ambassador to Egypt and thus were unable to handle the protestors who attacked the embassy.\n\n   Origins:  In September 2012, Muslim protesters objecting to a film that mocked the Prophet Mohammed climbed the walls of the U.S. Embassy in the Egyptian capital of Cairo and brought down the American flag: \n\nThe unrest in Cairo began when hundreds of protesters marched to the downtown embassy, gathering outside its walls and chanting against the movie and the US. \"Say it, don't fear: Their ambassador must leave,\" the crowd chanted. Dozens of protesters then scaled the embassy walls, and several went into the courtyard and took down the U.S. flag from a pole. They  brought it back to the crowd outside, which tried to burn it, but failing that tore it apart. The protesters on the wall then raised on the flagpole a black flag with a Muslim declaration of faith, \"There is no god but God and Mohammed is his prophet.\" The flag, similar to the banner used by al-Qa'ida, is commonly used by ultraconservatives around the region. The crowd grew throughout the evening with thousands standing outside the embassy, chanting \"Islamic, Islamic. The right of our prophet will not die.\" A group of women in black veils and robes that left only their eyes exposed chanted, \"Worshippers of the Cross, leave the Prophet Mohammed alone.\" The protest was sparked by outrage over a video being promoted by an extreme anti-Muslim Egyptian Christian campaigner in the US, clips of which are available on the social website YouTube and dubbed in Egyptian Arabic. The video depicts Mohammed as a fraud, showing him having sex and calling for massacres.\n A few days later, rumors circulated online that the U.S. Marine guards stationed at the embassy had been hindered in their efforts to defend it because the  U.S. ambassador to Egypt, Anne Patterson, had prevented them from carrying live ammunition: \n\nPatterson did not permit US Marine guards to carry live ammunition, according to USMC blogs. Thus she neutralized any US military capability that was dedicated to preserve her life and protect the US Embassy. In this respect, she did not defend US sovereign territory and betrayed her oath of office. She neutered the Marines posted to defend the embassy, trusting the Egyptians over the Marines.\n\n However, a 13 September 2012 memorandum from Major Alex Cross, Deputy Director of the Marine Liaison Office to the U.S. House of Representatives, stated that Marines at the American embassy in Cairo had been authorized to carry live ammunition: memorandum \n\nThe Ambassador did not impose restrictions on weapons or weapons status on the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group (MCESG) detachment.  The MCESG Marines in Cairo were allowed to have live ammunition in their weapons.  The Ambassador and Regional Security Officer have been completely and appropriately engaged with the security situation. Reports of Marines not being able to have their weapons loaded per direction from the Ambassador are not accurate.\n\n Fox News also reported that: \n\nA Marine spokesperson at the Pentagon denied reports that U.S. Marines defending the American embassy in Egypt were not permitted by the State Department to carry live ammunition in a statement to Fox News. Pentagon Lt. Col. Chris Hughes told the outlet: \"The ambassador and RSO [Regional Security Officer] have been completely and appropriately engaged with the security situation. No restrictions on weapons or weapons status have been imposed. This information comes from the Det Commander at AMEMB [American Embassy] Cairo.\"\n Last updated:  15 September 2012\n    Weinstein, Adam.  \"Claim Obama Administration Forbade Marines from Carrying Live Ammo.\"\n   Mother Jones.  13 September 2012.

            "For nearly a century, people have made the mistake of claiming that a quotation about Lincoln was actually a quotation by him. "
        ],
        "justification": "In September 2019, we received multiple inquiries about the authenticity and provenance of a quotation widely attributed to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. On Sept. 21, the right-leaning Facebook page Turning Point USA posted a meme that read: \"'If you want to test a man's character, give him power.' Abraham Lincoln.\" The meme was accompanied by a caption that stated, \"Big government is [sic] abuses its power!\"    That quotation has been attributed to Lincoln for almost a century. Variations of it have appeared in multiple newspaper columns, it has been promulgated in countless memes and quotation compendiums, and it was widely shared when it was tweeted out by the writer J.K. Rowling in 2017. appeared multiple newspaper columns memes tweeted It has been attributed to Lincoln in the U.S. Senate on three occasions, including two citations by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and the earliest Lincoln attribution we found was in the early 1930s.  occasions two citations earliest The full quotation is usually given as, \"Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.\" In reality, Lincoln never uttered or wrote those words, or words to that effect. Rather, they were said about him. The original version of the quotation came on Jan. 16, 1883, during a speech in Washington, D.C., by the prominent writer and orator Robert Ingersoll.  According to newspaper reports, Ingersoll was introducing another speaker, who was scheduled to give a lecture on Lincoln, at an unspecified \"auditorium\" in the nation's capital. During the course of his introductory remarks (which were printed in full by the press), Ingersoll said: printed said \"... If you want to know the difference between an orator and a speaker, read the oration of Lincoln at Gettysburg, and then read the speech of Everett at the same place. One came from the heart, the other was born only of the voice. Lincoln's speech will be remembered forever. Everett's no man will read. It was like plucked flowers. [Applause].  oration Everett \"If you want to find out what a man is to the bottom, give him power. Any man can stand adversity  only a great man can stand prosperity. It is the glory of Abraham Lincoln that he never abused power only on the side of mercy. [Applause]. He was a perfectly honest man. When he had power, he used it in mercy ...\"   A modified version of those lines later appeared in published volumes of Ingersoll's speeches and essays. For example, in his 1895 \"Abraham Lincoln, a Lecture,\" he wrote: wrote \"Nothing discloses real character like the use of power. It is easy for the weak to be gentle. Most people can bear adversity. But if you wish to know what a man really is, give him power. This is the supreme test. It is the glory of Lincoln that, having almost absolute power, he never abused it, except on the side of mercy.\" The exact same formulation of words appeared in Volume 3 of the 12-volume \"Works of Robert G. Ingersoll,\" which was published in 1902, three years after the well-known orator's death.  appeared For a few decades, Ingersoll's pithy praise of Lincoln was widely cited and correctly attributed in American newspapers, but the subject of the quotation appears to have been conflated with its author, beginning in the 1930s. Newspaper archives indicate that the quotation became increasingly condensed and increasingly attributed to Lincoln over the following decades, and in the present day Ingersoll's original authorship has been almost entirely eclipsed.  Turning Point USA was far from the first to mistakenly attribute the quotation to Lincoln in the site's September 2019 meme, but the error was the latest prominent example in a list that stretches back almost 100 years.

        "justification": "Claim:  Photograph shows Detroit slums with downtown skyscrapers in the background. REAL PHOTOGRAPH; INACCURATE DESCRIPTION Example:  [Collected via e-mail, August 2009] \nSeveral website list this photograph as Detroit. The skyline looks likely, but the slum in front looks more like a composite of the edge of a Brazilian city with the modern Detroit skyline. Is this photo legitimate? Ive only been to Detroit once, and while I wanted to kill myself after driving through, I dont remember it being this bad. \n\n\n\n   Origins:  Just as the recent financial woes of the \"Big Three\" U.S. automobile manufacturers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) have been held up as exemplars of the decline of American industry, so has their home base  Detroit, Michigan  been offered as symbolic of the decay of the \"rust belt\" manufacturing-industrial cities of the northeastern United States. Detroit was once the fourth-largest city in the U.S., a booming industrial metropolis that in 1950 boasted a population of 1.85 million.  By 2009 it was home to less than half as many people (770,000), the median household income of its remaining residents was $28,370 (about half the national average), and the median home price was a minuscule $7,100.  The news magazine The Week described Detroit's modern status thusly in October 2009: \n\nOutside the city's downtown core of office buildings, Detroit looks like a post-apocalyptic nightmare. The collapse of the auto industry, political dysfunction, and epidemics of crime, drugs, and arson have battered Detroit like a slow-motion hurricane,  leveling entire neighborhoods and causing a major chunk of the population to flee. Nearly 30 percent of the city, an area almost the size of San Francisco, has been abandoned to \"urban prairie\"  vast depopulated stretches of high grass and shattered asphalt. An Asian plant species sometimes called \"ghetto palm\" sprouts from the remains of abandoned buildings, where wild pheasants are occasionally sighted. The torched skeletons of homes are commonplace. In the 1980s and '90s, demolition permits outnumbered building permits by more than 10-1. Nearly 30 percent of the city's remaining housing stock  more than 100,000 units  lies vacant.\n Although the above-displayed photograph of a shantytown juxtaposed against the background of a gleaming, skyscraper-filled downtown core might superficially match a description of modern Detroit, elements of the picture don't match that location.  (It's unlikely, for example, that either residents of the thin wood and tin-sheet shacks or palm trees could survive the harshly low wintertime temperatures common to that area.) This type of picture is one that, unfortunately, could have been snapped in any number of places around the world.  Specifically, it's a photograph of Makati, which is part of the greater metropolitan area of the Philippine capital city of Manila and is an international financial and commercial hub.  It's not uncommon for news stories to feature photographs of Makati as a way of illustrating growing economic disparities found within some rapidly developing countries and regions:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShanty houses are cramped in the foreground while construction of new high rise buildings rise in the background at Manila's financial district of Makati. Asia is broadly on track to reduce extreme poverty by half by 2015, reflecting the positive impact of its dynamic economy in the lives of its nearly four billion people, according to a joint report released by the Asian Development Bank and the UN Development Programme in Manila.\n\n\n\n Another photograph of Makati taken from a similar vantage point can be seen in a 2006 BusinessWeek article about squatter cities. photograph article Last updated:  8 September 2013\n    The Week.  \"Detroit: A City on the Brink.\"\n   16 October 2009.\n",

The proposed \"Cordoba House\" overlooking the World Trade Center site  where a group of jihadists killed over 3000 Americans and destroyed one of our most famous landmarks  is a test of the timidity, passivity and historic ignorance of American elites.  For example, most of them don't understand that \"Cordoba House\" is a deliberately insulting term.  It refers to Cordoba, Spain  the capital of Muslim conquerors who symbolized their victory over the Christian Spaniards by transforming a church there into the world's third-largest mosque complex. Today, some of the Mosque's backers insist this term is being used to \"symbolize interfaith cooperation\" when, in fact, every Islamist in the world recognizes Cordoba as a symbol of Islamic conquest.  It is a sign of their contempt for Americans and their confidence in our historic ignorance that they would deliberately\ninsult us this way. Those Islamists and their apologists who argue for \"religious toleration\" are arrogantly dishonest. They ignore the fact that more than 100 mosques already exist in New York City. Meanwhile, there are no churches or synagogues in all of Saudi Arabia. In fact no Christian or Jew can even enter Mecca. And they lecture us about tolerance. If the people behind the Cordoba House were serious about religious toleration, they would be imploring the Saudis, as fellow Muslims, to immediately open up  Mecca to all and immediately announce their intention to allow non-Muslim houses of worship in the Kingdom.   They should be asked by the news media if they would be willing to lead such a campaign.  We have not been able to rebuild the World Trade Center in nine years.  Now we are being told a 13-story, $100 million megamosque will be built within a year overlooking the site of the most devastating surprise attack in American history.  Finally where is the money coming from?  The people behind the Cordoba House refuse to reveal all their funding sources.  America is experiencing an Islamist cultural-political offensive designed to undermine and destroy our civilization. Sadly, too many of our elites are the willing apologists for those who would destroy them if they could.  No mosque. No self deception. No surrender. The time to take a stand is now  at this site on this issue.\n Origins:  Newt Gingrich is a Republican politician who represented Georgia districts in the U.S. Congress for twenty years between 1979-99, attaining the position of House Minority Whip in 1989 and serving as Speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999.  Although he has as yet made no announcement one way or the other, many have speculated that Gingrich is poised to wage a campaign as a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. The \"Newt Direct\" section of\nNewt Gingrich's official web site at newt.org includes copies of his newsletter writings, television appearances, and speeches, a number of which in mid-2010 focused on the controversy over the proposed building of a 15-story Cordoba House community center (more commonly referred to as the \"Ground Zero Mosque\") in downtown Manhattan a few blocks away from the site of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.

        "justification": "Claim:  Man fooled into thinking he has been executed dies of a heart attack.  LEGEND Examples:  \n[Smith, 1986] A group of Birmingham students were discussing the question of hypnosis. They decided to try an experiment and invited into the lecture room a laboratory assistant who was always causing them problems and getting them into trouble.  They explained to him that no one could be made to do anything under hypnosis that they would not do when fully awake. They said that a student had been hypnotised, told to execute someone and they wanted the laboratory assistant to help them prove the student would not go through with it.  They asked the assistant to kneel down with his head bent as if ready to have his head chopped off. The 'hypnotised' student was then brought in and with a suitable build-up he gently dropped a wet towel across the back of the victim's neck. Unfortunately, the assistant was of a nervous disposition and the shock brought on a heart attack which killed him.\n \n [Collected via e-mail, 2004] Another story I've heard quite a few times is about a man in England (before capital punishment was outlawed there) condemned to death by hanging. Shortly before he dies, he is told that he will have his throat cut with a knife instead. A hood is placed over his head and, instead of the sharp side, the blunt side of the knife is run across his throat. He makes gurgling noises as if he has just had his throat cut and dies. The teller usually points out that the \"experiment\" was carried out by British psychologists.\n Origins:  According to folklorist Paul Smith, this legend of a faked beheading's causing the victim to expire of fright reaches back into distant times, with one well-traveled version from the 1800s set at Aberdeen University recounting the mock execution of a porter named Downie. Smith also asserts that an even earlier Italian analogy is found in a story from the 1500s wherein a jester is accidentally polished off in a staged  execution. More recent tellings describe the about-to-be-deceased as a laboratory assistant who is a liability to the group (Smith, 1986) and as a thoroughly loathed \"knows it all\" freshman (Cohen, 1993), each of whom are lured to their deaths in efforts to prove hypnotized people will not do anything they would not do ordinarily. The victim's being positioned in the mind of the audience as the sort of fellow one would have no love for is far from accidental  his unsympathetic portrayal renders those regaled with the tale free to focus on the blood-chilling manner of the death absent the distraction of pity for the man who died. Likewise, little by way of compassionate urges gets in the way of the story about the condemned criminal: he obviously must have been a right rotter to be under sentence of death  and besides, he was about to kick the bucket anyway. The theme of a physically unharmed victim who passes away only because he believes himself to be dying underpins another urban legend. In \"Deadly Imaginings,\" a man trapped in a non-functioning refrigerator he presumes to be turned on perishes by way of freezing to death. refrigerator Can people be fatally deceived into thinking they've been put to death? We don't honestly know, but we do point out the entire lack of genuine reports of such cases.

The victim was taken to a hospital, where he died of his injuries. identified The narrative shared in the meme reflects the talking points favored by anti-immigration partisans in both Europe and the U.S. in regards to the tragedy. As the digital media outlet Vocativ reported, \"Anti-immigrant groups, websites and supporters are now seizing on the school stabbing story in Sweden  and the rumors its inspired  as the latest tale of barbaric migrants run amok.\" Vocativ For instance, the right-leaning Swedish website Fria Tider reported that Pileckas \"was stabbed to death by a student from the Arab world after protecting a girl whom the killer had harassed.\" In the U.S., Breitbart ran with a similar headline: \"15 Year Old Boy Was Stabbed to Death by Arab Migrant Because He Was Protecting Young Girl from Sex Assault.\" right-leaning reported Breitbart headline Although such sites cast Pileckas as a hero, criminal proceedings involving children aren't public in Sweden, so media reports about the motive for the killing are drawn from interviews given by the parents of both children and have not been verified by authorities. Nils Karlsson, a member of the municipal council in the Swedish city of Malm, said those with detailed knowledge about the case are prohibited from commenting on it publicly because of the young age of the offender. \"He was turned over to social services and they operate under very strict secrecy. So those who know more about the case are forbidden by law to talk about it. I highly doubt that Fria Tider has access to accurate information about any motives,\" Karlsson told us. Both children were immigrants: Pileckas' family is from Lithuania, while the 14-year-old suspect is from Syria. As is customary in Sweden, authorities don't furnish personal information about suspects, particularly minors, and Swedish legacy media outlets typically don't publish it. Discussion about motives initially surfaced on social media and reports from news outlets operating in the native languages of the suspect and victim. Stockholm-based Arabic language publication Al Kompis identified Pileckas' killer as Ahmed Mustafa al-Haj Ali. identified In interviews given to Lithuanian-language news outlets, including Lrytas.lt and the Baltic publication Delhi.lt, the murder victim's father, ydrnas Pileckas, said his son was killed because he had defended a female student against harassment from Ali. The Swedish tabloid Expressen did report an incident that involved the victim, the suspect, and other students in November 2015 that possibly led to the stabbing, but it didn't go into detail about what happened. According to Expressen, Arminas Pileckas reportedly \"protected a classmate against the 14-year-old and urged [that] the classmate be left alone.\" But Expressen didn't state that classmate's gender or ethnicity and didn't mention sexual harassment or assault. Lrytas.lt Delhi.lt report Ali's father, Mustafa al-Hajj Ali, told Al Kompis that Pileckas had been bullying his son but adults at the school had failed to intervene. Vocativ published a widely-shared video that purported to show Pileckas slapping the suspect, then chasing him down a hallway, but the video didn't show what led to the encounter. Ali's father told Al Kompis that the video was originally shared on the social media platform Snapchat as part of a bullying campaign against his son. Al Kompis video The claim that Pileckas was protecting a girl from sexual assault may have morphed out of various unconfirmed reports about the murder investigation alongside widespread but unfounded Internet rumors labeling Sweden the \"rape capital of Europe\"  a claim pushed by anti-immigrant activists who exploited an influx of Arabic-speaking refugees to Sweden in 2015 for political purposes.

Follow our post-election coverage here. here In November 2020, Snopes readers asked us to examine the accuracy of claims that \"more than one million\" people had taken part in a demonstration in support of U.S. President Donald Trump, who disputed the result of that year's presidential election a week after Democratic candidate Joe Biden was declared the winner.  The event, on Nov. 14, was billed variously as the \"Million MAGA March,\" the \"March for Trump\" and \"Stop the Steal DC\", inspired by unfounded or false allegations and conspiracy theories that electoral fraud had played a telling part in President-elect Biden's victory.  That morning, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted out screenshots from live Fox News coverage of the event, adding \"AMAZING! More than one MILLION marchers for President @realDonaldTrump descend on the swamp in support.\" tweeted out   Trump himself posted and promoted wildly varying estimates of the attendance at the event. In one tweet, he referred to \"tens of thousands\" of participants, and in another, \"hundreds of thousands.\" He also retweeted a post by right-wing activist and Students for Trump Co-founder Ryan Fournier, who wrote that \"More than a MILLION people showed up\" on Pennsylvania Ave., in the nation's capital: referred another retweeted wrote   Crowd sizes are notoriously difficult to estimate, and Trump's presidency began with a high-profile dispute over the number of people who attended his January 2017 inauguration. Due to the political sensitivities that often surround estimates of crowds at contentious rallies and demonstrations, law enforcement agencies and other official sources in many jurisdictions have increasingly stopped providing such figures. difficult dispute In keeping with that trend, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) in Washington, D.C., told Snopes \"MPD does not provide numbers on crowd size.\" The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) did not respond to our inquiry. In the absence of an impartial and authoritative estimate, we are issuing a rating of \"Unproven\" in relation to the claim that \"more than one million\" people descended upon D.C. for a pro-Trump demonstration on Nov. 14, 2020. However, that estimate is likely to be a significant exaggeration.  Photographs and videos of crowds are often unreliable indicators of their size, but they are not entirely worthless. We can take pictures of previous gatherings reliably estimated to have contained around one million people, and compare them with pictures of the November 2020 pro-Trump demonstration.  For example, on Sep. 29, 1979, a crowd estimated to have numbered 1.2 or 1.25 million people (akin to the \"more than one million\" claimed by McEnany, Fournier and others) gathered in the Phoenix Park in Dublin, Ireland, to attend a mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II. At the time, the population of the Republic of Ireland was estimated to be 3.4 million. estimated numbered estimated The following images and video footage give a good indication of what a crowd of that size looks like:  Pope John Paul II (1920 - 2005) as he is driven though waves to the crowd in Phoenix Park after an outdoor Mass, Dublin, Ireland, September 29, 1979.

FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, March 2012] \nThis was posted today, as I am sure it has been numerous times before. It has a date of 8/28/2010. Facebook, to my knowledge, does NOT give $1 to anyone who has had picture shares for whatever the reason.  This is a child who was in very apparent discomfort and pain from what looks like a massive tumor.   \n Origins:  The item displayed above shows several photographs of a girl with what appears to be a severely distended abdomen and offers the claim that Facebook will donate $1 toward her treatment every time her picture is shared.  As with all such Internet appeals, this item is merely yet another reiteration of a long-running class of hoax which lures the gullible into spreading such  hoax messages by promising that some entity will donate money for treatment of some medical condition every time the message is forwarded, posted, or shared on the Internet.  Multiple charities and companies have been unfairly dragged into such hoaxes over the years by being named in messages like these, causing them to have to spend considerable time and effort disclaiming them. However, although the nature of the appeal is false, the girl pictured in the photographs is real.  She was not suffering from a cancerous tumor as suggested in some versions of this hoax, but was instead diagnosed with Budd-Chiari syndrome, a hepatic vein obstruction that prevents blood from flowing out of the liver and back to the heart and thus results in abdominal distension.  According to a November 2010 China Daily article, 4-year-old Hu Yunxing of Shanxi Province, China, had traveled to Beijing that month to seek diagnosis and treatment of her condition: Budd-Chiari syndrome article \n\nThe 4-year-old girl who traveled to the capital desperately seeking a cure for an ailment that left her with a massively oversized stomach has been diagnosed and is being treated by China's top expert. Hu Yunxing is suffering from Budd-Chiari Syndrome, said her relieved father, Hu Tianpeng. He said he is delighted that the family's four-year search for a diagnosis is finally over. \"Now that we have a diagnosis, we are so happy and have great confidence that there will be a future for our daughter,\" Hu said.\n The following month, the same publication reported that Hu Yunxing was too ill to complete her treatment at that time: reported \n\nThe 4-year-old girl who traveled to Beijing from Shanxi province in search of a cure for her massively oversized stomach is too ill to finish her treatment. Hu Tianpeng, the father of Hu Yunxing, said she developed a fever several times during her treatment and the hospital sent him a notice on Dec 3 saying his daughter was close to death. He said his daughter's temperature started to rise after doctors began drawing liquid from her stomach. \"Her body temperature reached 40 C. I used alcohol and water to cool her down,\" he said. He said her condition has since improved.\n A series of February 2011 photographs of Hu Yunxing from the Chinese photo agency ChinaFotoPress were captioned with the information that she had undergone a 4-hour operation on 21 February 2011 which reduced her belly circumference from 108cm (42.5 inches) to about 40cm (15.7 inches), and she was expected to be discharged from the hospital within the week.  A 1 March 2011 Chinese news account reported that Hu Yunxing's weight had dropped from 27 kg (59.4 lbs.) to 14 kg (30.8 lbs.) as a result of the surgery, and that after 3 to 6 months of rehabilitation she should be able to live and play like a normal child. photographs news account Last updated:  14 March 2012\n    Wanli, Yang.  \"Big-Stomach Girl, 4, Too Ill to Finish Treatment: Father.\"\n   China Daily  8 December 2010.\n",

An article published by theNew York Timesthe day after the attack also noted that Reagan cut his vacation short to return to the White House: noted \"There are no words that can express our sorrow and grief over the loss of those splendid young men and the injury to so many others,'' the President said gravely this morning, standing in the rain outside the White House after a hurried return from a golfing weekend in Augusta, Ga. The second photo displayed abovewas also taken the day before the Beirut bombings: before President Ronald Reagan, clad in pajamas and bathrobe, talking on telephone to Robert McFarlane and Secretary of State George Shultz, re urgent request from five members of Eastern Carribbean States on the situation in Grenada. However, the former president wasn't always necessarily quickto react after deadlyinternational incidents. After a Korean airliner was shot down by the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983, President Reagan remained at his ranch in Santa Barbara: remained At this point, (White House spokesman Larry Speakes) Speakes was interrupted and asked if Reagan was going back to Washington. He ignored the question and read a statement on the Middle East. Asked again if Reagan was going back to Washington, Speakes answered, \"There are no plans for the president to return to Washington earlier than anticipated.\" Speakes walked away from the podium and then came back to take questions. He announced, as he does every day in California, what Reagan intended to do that day: \"The president, as usual, is planning at horseback ride this morning and will generally work around the ranch in the afternoon. The weather there is as it is here, sunny and warm.\" Thesememes are based on an assumption that a U.S. president has to react immediately to breaking news of a violent incident or crisis by returning to the nation's capital, even when such an action does not facilitate the handling of the situation. When President Obama was criticized in 2014 for his reaction toMalaysian Airlines Flight 17 being shot down (reportedly by pro-Russian insurgents), reporter ChrisWallace noted that sometimes, \"the best thing presidents can do is nothing\": criticized I know there's like an immediate reaction, that you want to say he should have run back to Washington and gone back to the Situation Room. I know that a lot of folks at Fox here are saying that. As somebody who covered the White House and saw for six years Ronald Reagan in various situations, sometimes the best thing presidents can do is nothing, to continue on. If he had gone back to Washington and gone to the situation room  first of all, there's not much he can do, we're not in control of the situation. And it would have dialed it up. I was covering Ronald Reagan at that time [i.e., when the Korean airliner was shot down].He was in Santa Barbara at his ranch when that happened, and quite frankly he didn't want to leave. And his advisers realized how terrible this looked, and eventually persuaded him he had to fly back to Washington and had to give this speech to the nation, but it did take him four days. \n ",

REAL PHOTOGRAPH;  INACCURATE DESCRIPTION Example:  [Collected via Facebook, January 2015]  Nigerian women who repulsed a Boko Haram attack, kudos to these gutsy bravehearts. \n\n Origins:  Boko Haram (a term roughly translated as \"Western education is forbidden\") is a terrorist Islamist movement that has killed an estimated 5,000 civilans, mostly in northern and central Nigeria, since 2009.  The photograph displayed above has been circulated with\ncaptions describing it as depicting \"Nigerian women who repulsed a Boko Haram attack, kudos to these gutsy bravehearts,\" and it was posted to the Facebook page of HSGCA (Hypocrisy and Stupidity of Gun Control Advocates) on 20 January 2015 along with text identifying it as a picture of teachers and security guards armed with automatic weapons to protect students from Boko Haram militants:  \n\nSo what is your take on this one? Should these teachers and security guards get some #gunsense and turn in their evil military grade assault-o-matic weapons and mega capacity clipazine to the police and simply hope that the next time Boko Haram drops in that the cops get there in time OR Continue face shooting the psycho mutts who try to hard them & their students\n (The mention of Spaghetti-Os is a reference to a plan implemented at some American schools encouraging students to bring canned goods to school to hurl at intruders in case of a classroom invasion.) canned goods Although the photograph is real (and somewhat in the spirit of what has been claimed of it), it is not related to Boko Haram, Nigeria, or armed teachers protecting students.  The image was originally published in the Times of London on 23 November 2012 and accompanied an article (\"Women are bent on revenge against Tuareg rebels in Mali\") by correspondent Jerome Starkey about women in Mali joining the Ganda Koy militia (a pro-government paramilitary force) in order to seek revenge for relatives killed or raped by Tuareg rebels: published Jerome Starkey \n\nArmed men stopped the bus at Timbuktu's river port and dragged two women and a teenage girl behind a nearby dune. \"They took turns,\" said Barka Dicko, scowling as she slung a Kalashnikov over her embroidered smock. \"One of them pointed his gun at me, while the other one raped my niece. She was 13. She was a virgin, but they forced themselves on her.\" The attack came as separatist Tuareg rebels seized control of northern Mali. \"She screamed until she fell unconscious,\" Ms Dicko said. She and another woman were left unharmed but sick with guilt and burning for revenge. Now, as her niece recovers with relatives in the capital, Bamako, Ms Dicko is leading a group of 42 women bent on retribution. They are part of the Ganda Koy militia, a  pro-government paramilitary force, roughly 800 strong and drawn mostly on ethnic lines. \"We do everything the men do,\" she said, as young women marched by singing army songs and men staged a mock assault. \"We also take care of the food.\" Ms Dicko said that the men who raped her niece were fair-skinned Tuareg nomads wearing the uniforms of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). Most men and women in the Ganda Koy are dark-skinned ethnic Songhais and Fulani, all hungry for vengeance against the white Tuaregs from the north. Zeinab Maiga, a 22-year-old Arabic student from Gao, dreamt of being a primary school teacher before she fled her home five months ago. \"I have a message for the MNLA and all the other groups in the north,\" she said. \"Even if there are negotiations, even if everybody agrees a peace, if I get my hands on one of them I won't just slit their throat, I will chop their head off.\" Fatima Toure, a former disc jockey from Gao, said that the rebels killed her brother and raped two of her young neighbours. \"I just want to go back home,\" she said. \"But if we make peace now these problems will come back. We must have combat first.\"\n Last updated:  4 February 2015\n ",

MIXTURE:   \nFALSE: Home Depot acquiesced to a demand from CAIR that the chain provide 'Muslim Sensitivity Training' to all their employees.\n\n  \n\nTRUE: CAIR provided cultural awareness training to a few Home Depot stores in Michigan upon request of store management.\n\n\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, September 2014] \nCAIR is a terrorist organization with terror ties that will knock your eyes out. Since 9/11, CAIR associates have been indicted multiple times on terrorism-related charges. Now this same group has demanded and received from home improvement giant Home Depot that it's employees be subjected to \"muslim cultural awareness sensitivity training\". Look at the bright orange of the Home Depot logo, and then remind yourself what ISIS forces their beheading victims to wear when they are executed and you will begin to get the picture. Middle East today, middle America tomorrow.\n Origins:  This item about Home Depot employees supposedly being forced to undergo 'Muslim Sensitivity Training' due to demands by CAIR (the Council on American-Islamic Relations) began as an article published on disreputable web sites in September 2014.  What it refers to is a press release issued by the Michigan chapter of CAIR in March 2014 announcing that organization had recently provided cultural awareness training to employees at a Home Depot store in Dearborn, Michigan: disreputable press release \nThe Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations yesterday provided cultural awareness training to employees at a Home Depot store in Dearborn, Mich.  CAIR-MI Executive Director Dawud Walid and CAIR-MI Safe Spaces Coordinator Warda Kalim discussed issues relating to customer interactions and modesty in Islam and highlighted religious accommodations concerns of Muslim employees. CAIR-MI has provided similar trainings in the past to other Home Depot locations in Southeastern Michigan. \"We welcome such opportunities to engage Home Depot and other business establishments to better serve their Muslim customers and accommodate the cultural competency of their Muslim employees,\" said CAIR-MI Executive Director Dawud Walid. CAIR has helped resolve a number of similar cases involving prayer in the workplace and offers a booklet, called \"An Employer's Guide to Islamic Religious Practices,\" to help corporate managers gain a better understanding of Islam and Muslims.\n Contrary to the tenor of the item reproduced above, a representative from CAIR-MI told us that CAIR had not \"demanded\" that \"Home Depot's employees be subjected to forced 'muslim cultural awareness sensitivity training'\"; rather, CAIR provided basic cultural awareness training to some employees at a single Home Depot store in Dearborn upon the request of that store's management, and the request was not triggered by any complaint or incident occurring at that store. Dearborn has been referred to as \"America's Muslim capital\" and is home to a large Arab-American population as well as the site of the largest mosque in the U.S. A third of Dearborn's population of 97,000 identifies as having Arab heritage, a third of Arab-Americans in Michigan are foreign born, and the Arabic-speaking population in the state grew by 26% from 2000 to 2010, according to the Arab American Institute (AAI). Thus familiarity with the preferences and customs of the employee and customers bases in that area are an essential aspect of business operations: America's Muslim capital \nDemographers say that Islam is one of the fastest growing religions in the United States. American Muslims are now found in all sectors of society. This growing Muslim population adds a new dimension to be considered by employers when dealing with issues of multiculturalism and diversity.\n\n   The material used in that cultural awareness training, CAIR's Employer's Guide to Islamic Religious Practices, is pretty basic stuff: a short guide to religiously-mandated practices of Muslim employees that provides brief overviews of Muslim holidays and the Ramadan fast, the timing and observation of daily prayers (and their effect on scheduling considerations for Muslim employees), Muslim dietary and dress requirements, and a few other religiously related employment considerations (e.g., Muslim employees should not be asked to serve or sell alcohol).

A winter blizzard of historic proportions wobbled an otherwise snow-tough Chicago, stranding hundreds of drivers for up to 12 hours overnight on the city's showcase lakeshore thoroughfare and giving many city schoolchildren their first ever snow day. A year later temperatures are in the mid 50's and flirting with record highs for this date. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato,File) Other news outlets, such as ABC Chicago, reported on the Chicago snow storm in February 2011, saying that hundreds of vehicles were abandoned: reported Motorists and their passengers were caught on Lake Shore Drive for hours before they opted to evacuate or officials told them to evacuate. They had been trapped by accidents ahead of them and traffic behind during the worst of the snow storm.

        "justification": "Claim:  Photographs show a mansion belonging to Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe. FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, July 2008] \nThis will knock your socks off!!!!!!!! Imagine who would have such taste and live in such opulence?\nAn American Billionaire?\nA Saudi Prince?\nLouis XIV of France?  Savour the pictures then scroll to the bottom of the page to see who owns this Work of Art.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     This Mansion is in Harare and belongs to:\nThe President of Zimbabwe - Robert Mugabe\nwhile his people starve, and die because of no medical help....and we are asked to help his people over and over again... he and his family live like this...... his GREED kills his people.....\nsend this to everyone you know, they can send it to everyone they know, soon the world will know what this man is doing to his people.\n Variations:  A February 2010 variant sited the pictured mansion in Salt Lake City and attributed ownership to presidential candidate Sen. Manny  of the Philippines. Origins:   In the mid-2000s, the South African press had been reporting for several years that Robert Mugabe, the president of Zimbabwe, was building a personal luxury retirement villa just outside the Zimbabwean capital of Harare.  A 2003 article described the in-progress mansion thusly: \n\nThe house with its 25 bedrooms in Borrowdale Brook Lane, an upmarket suburb in northern Harare, is being completed in haste because Mugabe allegedly wants to move in there when he retires. The retirement villa is about three times the size of Mugabe's current official residence and offices. Each of the rooms in the house apparently has a different theme, for example an Arabic room, Chinese rooms and a section in the French style. It is not known whether there is a British room. Four artisans from Morocco have apparently been carving the dome of the banquet hall for more than a year. The dome can be compared to the dome decorations of Saddam Hussain's palaces in Iraq.\n A 2005 article stated that the finishing touches were being applied to the mansion after three years of construction: \n\nIt took three years to complete the house. According to Mugabe, the mansion was not built with ratepayers' money but with donations from countries such as Serbia (the construction work), Malaysia (which donated the wood), China (the roof tiles and also the design of the house). However, it is not clear where the money came from for the Italian marble, the finest crystal from Europe, the sunken jacuzzis and carpets from the East. The mansion has 25 bedrooms, a flat for each of the three Mugabe children, a helipad, swimming pools and servants' quarters. Two artificial lakes form part of the extensive gardens. The house is three times bigger than State House, official residence of the country's head of state\n In 2008, the photographs displayed above began circulating in e-mail forwards that described them as pictures of Mugabe's completed retirement villa.\nHowever, even in the absence of additional identifying information about the source of the images, the claim that they were photographs of Robert Mugabe's  mansion was doubtful given that they had also been claimed over the years as depicting the lavish digs of a number of other celebrities and political figures around the world, such as former Nigerian military ruler Ibrahim Babangida, Indian film star Shahrukh Khan, Universal Church of the Kingdom of God founder Edir Macedo, former Secretary of Health Care of Azerbaijan, and (in 2010)  Senator Manny Villar of the Philippines.

        ],
        "justification": "Is this a mosquito? No. It's an insect spy drone for urban areas, already in production, funded by the US Government. It can be remotely controlled and is equipped with a camera and a microphone. It can land on you, and it may have the potential to take a DNA sample or leave RFID tracking nanotechnology on your skin. It can fly through an open window, or it can attach to your clothing until you take it in your home.  One of the current areas of research reportedly being undertaken in the scientific/military field is the development of micro air vehicles (MAVs), tiny flying objects intended to go places that cannot be (safely) reached by humans or other types of equipment. One of the primary military applications envisioned for MAVs is the gathering of intelligence (through the surreptitious use of cameras, microphones, or other types of sensors); among the more extreme applications posited for such devices is that they may eventually be used as \"swarm weapons\" which could be launched en masse against enemy forces. Some efforts in MAV research have involved trying to mimic birds or flying insects to achieve flight capabilities not attainable through other means of aerial propulsion. In 2007 a bug-like MAV model with a 3-cm wingspan was displayed at a robotics conference, in 2008 the U.S. Air Force released a simulated video showing MAVs about the size of bumblebees, and in 2012 engineers at Johns Hopkins University were studying the flight of butterflies to \"help small airborne robots mimic these maneuvers.\" birds displayed video butterflies The specific mosquito-like object pictured above is, however, just a conceptual mock-up of a design for a MAV, not a photograph of an actual working device \"already in production.\" And although taking DNA samples or inserting micro-RFID tracking devices under the skin of people are MAV applications that may some day be possible, such possibilities currently appear to be speculative fiction rather than reality. Some have claimed the U.S. government has not only researched and developed insect-like MAVs, but for several years has been furtively employing them for domestic surveillance purposes: The US government has been accused of secretly developing robotic insect spies amid reports of bizarre flying objects hovering in the air above anti-war protests. No government agency has admitted to developing insect-size spy drones but various official and private organisations have admitted that they are trying. But official protestations of innocence have failed to kill speculation of government involvement after a handful of sightings of the objects at political events in New York and Washington. Vanessa Alarcon, a university student who was working at an anti-war rally in the American capital [in September 2007], told the Washington Post: \"I heard someone say, 'Oh my God, look at those.' \"I look up and I'm like, 'What the hell is that?'. They looked like dragonflies or little helicopters. But I mean, those are not insects.\" Bernard Crane, a lawyer who was at the same event, said he had \"never seen anything like it in my life\". He added: \"They were large for dragonflies. I thought, 'Is that mechanical or is that alive?'\" The incident has similarities with an alleged sighting at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York when one peace march participant described on the internet seeing \"a jet-black dragonfly hovering about 10 feet off the ground, precisely in the middle of 7th Avenue\". Entomologists suggest that the objects are indeed dragonflies. Jerry Louton, an expert at the National Museum of Natural History, said Washington was home to large, impressively-decorated dragonflies that \"can knock your socks off\". Others maintain the technical obstacles involved in creating flying insect-sized robots have yet to be overcome: The technical challenges of creating robotic insects are daunting, and most experts doubt that fully working models exist yet. \"If you find something, let me know,\" said Gary Anderson of the Defense Department's Rapid Reaction Technology Office. Getting from bird size to insect size is not a simple matter of making everything smaller. \"You can't make a conventional robot of metal and ball bearings and just shrink the design down,\" said Ronald Fearing, a roboticist at the University of California at Berkeley. For one thing, the rules of aerodynamics change at very tiny scales and require wings that flap in precise ways  a huge engineering challenge. Scientists have only recently come to understand how insects fly. Even if the technical hurdles are overcome, insect-size fliers will always be risky investments. \"They can get eaten by a bird, they can get caught in a spider web,\" Professor Fearing said.

Follow our post-election coverage here. here Less than three weeks before the 2020 presidential election, social media posts claimed U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign created a policy proposal to help Black Americans with the help of a once-outspoken critic: American rapper Ice Cube. Trump supporters framed the alleged connection between the campaign and Cube as evidence of the candidate's strong collaboration skills and efforts to improve Black Americans' lives despite the country's growing culture war over race.   Meanwhile, former and current fans of the former N.W.A. member believed he had broken his 2016 pledge to \"never endorse\" Trump or for some reason changed his political alliances since writing the 2018 protest anthem, \"Arrest the President.\" The song's lyrics included: never endorse Arrest the President Arrest the president, you got the evidence\nThat [n*****] is Russian intelligence (Okay)\nWhen it rains it pours\nDid you know the new white was orange?\nBoy, you're showing your horns\nThey're tryin' to replace my halo with thorns   Here's what happened: In July 2020, Cube released a multi-faceted plan  what he called a \"Contract with Black America\" (CWBA)  outlining his ideas to close the country's wealth gap between Black and white Americans. It advocated more government contracts with Black businesses and abolishing privately run prisons, for example. The plan boasted the tagline, \"Whatever side of the aisle you're on, let's finally have something to celebrate.\" Contract with Black America Weeks later, as Cube promoted the plan on social media and condemned partisan politics, one viewer became especially important: Ken Kurson. Kurson, who knows Cube's business partner and is friends with White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner, sent Kushner a text message, saying a relationship with Cube \"could be a plus for the White House,\" Politico reported. social media Politico reported Then, the Trump campaign embarked in a weekslong courtship of Cube and his team, including invitations to the White House and phone calls, according to the news outlet. The effort culminated with a meeting including the performer and leaders of the Trump campaign at a hotel near the White House. Politico wrote: [The] iconic rapper quietly slipped into Washington, D.C., for a three-hour meeting near the White House with Kushner and other senior advisers to Trump. [...] After that sitdown, White House aides went back and forth with Ice Cube over his 13-point blueprint  parts of which they agreed with, others they did not. But a few weeks later, when Trump released his own proposal to boost African Americans, it included Ice Cubes biggest ask: a $500 billion capital infusion into the Black community.   Within weeks or days of that quiet meeting, Cube told TMZ that his end game for the 2020 election was to get either candidate  Trump or Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden  to adopt his contract as formal policy. In that interview, Cube said both campaigns had contacted him about his ideas and that Biden's party should be concerned that Trump could move forward with them before the election. Politico reported: told Politico reported \"A person familiar with the discussions said Ice Cube touched base with Bidens campaign, too, but received only a vague commitment to have 'a seat at the table' if the former vice president won. So Ice Cube moved ahead with Trump, saying he would take political support from anyone for his plan, regardless of party.\" On Oct. 11, Cube released a video on Twitter in which he attempted to promote what he described as a bipartisan strategy to achieve racial justice for Black people. He said: video Everybody's been mad at me because I haven't been on the fucking the gravy train of these candidates, especially Joe Biden and Harris. I don't trust none of them  no president has done right by us. [...] You know, straight up I believe the Democrats  they've been nice, they've been cordial, so to speak  I don't really see them pushing their policies in any different direction. [...] We also met with the Republicans and shit, they brought us in; we talked to them. They moved the agenda a lot because of what we said. In other words, Cube made it clear that he did not openly support Biden nor Trump, while noting that the Republican candidate acted on the performer's ideas.   But the confirmation of Cube's influence on the above-displayed White House proposal came two days later. A senior campaign adviser to the president, Katrina Pierson, tweeted a link to Trump's two-page \"promise to Black America\" pending his reelection, and publicly thanked Cube for his help developing the proposal. \"Leaders gonna lead, haters gonna hate,\" she wrote. tweeted promise to Black America   After that, Cube reiterated that he developed his ideas with the intention to \"talk to both sides\" of the political aisle and that both candidates had the chance to work with him. reiterated   In sum, since a Trump adviser said the campaign adjusted a policy proposal to include ideas from Cube  and news reports said the performer and his team had multiple conversations with White House representatives  we rate this claim \"True.\" Stimson, Brie.  \"Ice Cube Defends Working With Trump Campaign On 'Platinum Plan' For Black Americans.\"\r\n  Fox News.  15 October 2020.

Sadiq Khan In coverage which reflects negatively on the UK's capital city, right-wing web sites such as Breitbart have taken to referring to it almost exclusively as \"Sadiq Khan's London\" (a formulation the same sites did not use while Khan's predecessor, the white, Conservative party mayor Boris Johnson was in office). Similarly, in January 2018, anti-Islam blog JihadWatch.com prefaced an article about an increase in crime in the city with \"London under its Muslim mayor.\" referring did not article The putative link between Islam and London's violent crime rate (which has in fact been rising, along with that of England and Wales as a whole) is a common theme of right-leaning web sites and blogs. In that vein, the right-wing \"Minutemen Militia\" Facebook page posted a meme in April 2018 which asserted that \"Muslim immigrants\" were responsible for the vast majority of \"knife attacks\" taking place in London the preceding year: rising meme   We found no evidence to support the notion that the vast majority of such crimes were committed by Muslim immigrants. Although the meme did not cite any sources, it is likely the figure of 13,000 knife attacks was taken from January and February 2018 news reports surrounding the UK Office for National Statistics' (ONS) release of a statistical bulletin on crime in England and Wales in the 12 months leading up to 30 September 2017. (The next quarterly report was published on 26 April 2018, two weeks after the meme was posted, so the 13,000 figure could not have derived from that.) release Of that ONS bulletin, the London Evening Standard reported: reported Tables giving the precise figures show that there were 12,980 knife crimes in London over the 12 months to the end of last September. That was 2,452 more than the equivalent year earlier. This figure was subsequently repeated in the Sun newspaper. In fact, the figure of 12,980 knife offenses was taken from separate data published by the UK Home Office (roughly equivalent to the Department of Justice) for crimes involving a knife recorded by the City of London police and the Metropolitan police between 1 October 2016 and 30 September 2017. repeated Sun A spokesperson for the ONS told us that 12,980 was an accurate figure at the time of the January 2018 news reports, but that in the ensuing months the figures had been revised and updated. As of May 2018, the total number of recorded knife crimes in London, in the year leading up to September 2017, was 13,735. Figures from local government bear this out. On their \"weapon-enabled crime dashboard,\" the Mayor of London's Office for Policing and Crime stated that 13,767 knife crime offenses took place in the year leading up to the end of September 2017. Some 5,410 of these crimes (39 percent) were knife possession offenses, which are not at all synonymous with knife attacks, as the Minutemen Militia meme apparently categorized them. dashboard We turned up no available figures on the proportion of knife crimes in 2017 perpetrated by Muslims, or by immigrants, or by Muslim immigrants. Neither the Office for National Statistics, nor the Home Office, nor the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, has published any such data, so it is entirely unclear what the source of the \"11,000\" figure claimed in the meme is. (As far as we can tell, law enforcement agencies in the UK do not routinely track the religious affiliation of persons arrested on suspicion of criminal offenses.) The Home Office does track the ethnicity of criminal defendants and publishes this data once every two years. The most recent report, in 2016, showed that of the 25,121 people convicted for a violent crime that year, 83 percent identified as white, 7 percent identified as black; and 5.8 percent identified as Asian. (A spreadsheet with this data can be downloaded here.) report here In the UK, \"Asian\" is typically used to describe people of South Asian descent (e.g., Pakistani, Indian, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi) unlike in the United States, where \"Asian\" is more often used to describe people of East Asian descent (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Korean). However, nowhere is \"Muslim\" recognized as an ethnicity, as it is a religion and as such, can be represented by anyone from any country, so it is even more difficult to pin down exactly where their numbers came from. In 2013, London School of Economics professor Brian Bell conducted a major study of links between the concentration of various categories of immigrants in a region, and rates of crime in that area.

            "History: The hidden story of how the design of the California state flag was based on a mistake."
        ],
        "justification": "  The states of Texas and California have much in common historically: Admitted to the Union within five years of each other, both were much larger in area than any existing state (California was over twice as big, and Texas more than three times as big, as the then-largest state, Missouri, and they remained the two biggest states until the admission of Alaska more than a century later), both were wrested from Mexico through uprisings led by American-born revolutionaries, both declared themselves republics before joining the United States, and both later adopted state flags bearing single stars to symbolize their statuses as previously independent entities. One curious historical oddity distinguishes California from Texas, however: the design used for Californias state flag was the result of a rather large (and embarrassing) mistake. Most Americans are familiar with the basics of the Texas Revolution of 1835-36, particularly the heroic stand staged by the defenders of the Alamo in San Antonio, but the story of the 1846 revolt in California is far less well known. It began on the morning of 14 June 1846 when a small but heavily-armed group of thirty-three American-born settlers  led by Captain Jebediah Bartlett and his two lieutenants, Albert Bosc and Emmanuel d'Anjou  approached the home of General Mariano G. Vallejo, the Mexican comandante-general of California, pounded on the door and demanded he surrender the Sonoma Plaza fortress to them. Vallejo, an advocate of the American annexation of California despite his nationality, told the intruders he was sympathetic to their cause; nonetheless, they placed him under arrest and shipped him off to be held at Sutter's Fort. Texas Revolution Alamo Vallejo The rebels quickly decided to raise a new flag over Sonoma Plaza to announce their victory, resulting in hurried discussion about the composition of the banner. Most agreed it should feature something physically symbolic of California (and distinctly non-Mexican), but they could not reach a consensus on what that symbol should be. Finally Captain Bartlett, an agricultural magnate with large holdings in the Sacramento River area (and an amateur horticulturist who developed the\nBartlett pear), broke the deadlock by \"suggesting\" (none too gently) that the banner include a symbol reflective of the lush agricultural regions of northern California and the rich, 400-mile long Central Valley area. Bartlett pear Central Valley Acquiescing to the desires of their leader, the group quickly decided to honor both him and California agriculture by opting for a pear as the primary motif of their new flag. The group hurriedly assembled a rough prototype for their banner by borrowing a rectangular piece of light brown muslin and a four-inch strip torn from a red petticoat, sewing the red stripe (reminiscent of the ones found on the American national flag) onto the muslin, drawing a star in the upper left-hand corner to symbolize their independence (and, some claim, to express the rebels' solidarity with troops currently engaged in a war with Mexico precipitated by a dispute over the boundary of the recently-annexed state of Texas), and writing the words CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC in black to the right of the star. This nascent flag was then dispatched by messenger to the nearby home of William L. Todd (nephew of Mary Todd Lincoln, the wife of future president Abraham Lincoln) along with instructions for him to paint an image of a pear in the large empty portion of the banner and send the flag back with the messenger. But Todd misread the note (whether bad handwriting, poor spelling, or smeared ink was to blame remains a subject of dispute) and instead painted a crude bear onto the muslin, producing something like the following: war   The rebels hoisted their hastily-prepared pennant over Sonoma Plaza despite the error, intending to remake the flag at the first opportunity. The issue become moot within a month, however, when an American squadron under Commodore John D. Sloat captured Californias then-capital, Monterey, and proclaimed California to be American territory, bringing an end to the short-lived California Republic. The territory was formally ceded to the United States by Mexico at the conclusion of the Mexican-American War in 1848, and California was admitted to the Union as the 31st state in 1850. When California adopted an official state flag in 1911, they hearkened back to the days of that brief republic of 1846 and chose a modernized rendition of the (mistaken) bear flag design. Then, as now, few remembered that the bear flag was the product of a mistake or realized that a historically accurate California flag should look something more like this:   When the creators of television's political drama The West Wing (filmed in California, naturally) created their series in 1999, they gave a nod to this chapter of the Golden State's history through the in-joke of naming their fictional president \"Jed Bartlet.\" The West Wing Additional information about this page.

        "justification": "Title 4 of the United States Code, which outlines the role of flag of the United States, specifies occasions on which all government buildings, offices, public schools, and military bases are to fly their flags at half-staff, occasions which include the deaths of presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, justices of the Supreme Court, and state governors. As well, the President of the United States may issue proclamations directing U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff on other occasions, as was done in recent years for the death of Pope John Paul II, the interment of Frank Buckles (the last surviving American World War I veteran), the crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia's final mission (who died when the ship disintegrated during re-entry), the funeral of astronaut Neil Armstrong, and the shootings at Fort Hood, Virginia Tech, the Century Aurora theater, and Sandy Hook Elementary School. State governors may also direct all U.S. and state flags in their jurisdictions flown at half-staff to mark the death of state officials and state residents who died on active duty as members of the armed forces. In some cases governors may also direct that flags be lowered to half-staff to honor the passing of other state residents prominent outside the areas of government and the military. Christopher Scott \"Chris\" Kyle was a U.S. Navy SEAL who was known as \"the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History\" (a phrase which was used in the title of his autobiography). Kyle, a Texas native and resident, was shot and killed on 2 February 2013 at a Texas shooting range, and he was buried in the state capital of Austin. Texas governor Rick Perry issued a statement expressing his condolences to Chris Kyle's family \"and the thousands of service members that were his extended family,\" but despite a good deal of public support for the gesture, Governor Perry did not issue a proclamation directing flags to be flown at half-staff statewide on the occasion of either Chris Kyle's memorial service or his funeral. (As noted above, that honor is a traditional one for those who have died while active duty members of the armed forces, but Kyle did not die on active duty, having left the U.S. Navy in 2009.) statement Pop singer Whitney Houston passed away on 11 February 2012 from an accidental drowning in a bathtub, an event which the Los Angeles County coroner's office reported was due to the \"effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use.\" Houston, a New Jersey native, was also buried in that state, and New Jersey governor Chris Christie made a somewhat controversial decision in directing all New Jersey state flags to be flown at half-staff in her honor  critics contended that such a gesture should be reserved for members of the military, first responders, and state officials, and also that \"it was wrong to honor a drug addict.\" Governor Christie defended his decision, saying: \"I am disturbed by people who believe that because of her history of substance abuse that somehow she's forfeited the good things that she did in her life.\" (The previous year, Governor Christie had also directed flags to be flown at half-staff to mark the passing of Clarence Clemons, the saxophonist for Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, with little public outcry.) Although the White House issued a statement through press secretary Jay Carney after Whitney Houston's death noting that President Obama's \"thoughts and prayers are with Whitney Houston's family, especially her daughter,\" as far as we know President Obama has made no public expression of condolence or mourning to mark the passing of Chris Kyle: Example: [Collected via e-mail, February 2013] A friend posted a meme on Facebook today, the gist of which was as follows: Chris Kyle (American soldier who was shot and killed at a gun range recently) doesn't get mentioned by Obama, but Obama had the nerve to order flags lowered to half-mast in honor of Whitney Houston.  It is not true that President Obama ordered flags throughout the country flown at half-staff to honor Whitney Houston; as noted above, that action was undertaken only at a state level by the governor of New Jersey. In March 2016, after former First Lady Nancy Reagan died, a new version of this rumor began to circulate: specifically, that President Obama lowered White House flags for Whitney Houston, but not for Nancy Reagan. This is false, as the President called for flags at the White House and all federal buildings be flown at half-mast until her interment. died false",

It just does not make any sense.\n\n The Marine in the photograph is Lance Cpl. Kyle Carpenter, who was severely wounded by a thrown grenade in Afghanistan in 2010. His story has been covered extensively in the Marine Corps Times (which published back-to-back cover stories about him in January 2012), summarized as follows on that publication's blog: blog \n\nYou may recognize this face. That's Lance Cpl. Kyle Carpenter, who was severely wounded in Afghanistan in 2010 when insurgents chucked a hand grenade onto the roof where he and another Marine, Lance Cpl. Nick Eufrazio, were posting security. In the months since the attack, as Carpenter has undergone numerous surgeries to address his injuries, he has become an ambassador, of sorts, for the Marine Corps and its wounded warriors, inspiring family, friends and fellow Marines with his undying optimism in the face of a difficult recovery. He has dined with Vice President Joe Biden, attended events hosted by the commandant  and even mugged for photos alongside college cheerleaders and UFC star Brian Stann. Eufrazio, by contrast, weighs 100 pounds and is unable to speak. He resides in a Florida veterans hospital that specializes in caring for patients who've sustained traumatic brain injuries. These men's stories, writes Marine Corps Times senior writer Dan Lamothe, is \"a classic example of the cruelty of war.\" Carpenter came to our attention last year, when we received word that the state legislature in his native South Carolina honored him with a  resolution claiming he \"took the full blast from an enemy hand grenade in seeking to save a fellow Marine.\" He and Eufrazio are the only two eyewitnesses to what happened that day on the outskirts of Marjah. Carpenter says he can't remember what happened in the moments right before the attack. Eufrazio can't communicate. The Corps continues to investigate the incident, officials say, and it's unclear whether all of their questions ever will be answered. The story prompted a strong response from our readers  and for several of Carpenter's fellow Marines present that day to step forward to tell their side of the story. They're adamant in their response: based on what they saw, Carpenter deserves the Medal of Honor, they say. This weeks cover story reflects that. It outlines what they remember and what the Corps has asked them to do as the investigation moves forward. Combined, the two cover stories share Carpenter and Eufrazio's ordeal in a way that no other publication has, more than a year later. As weve mentioned before, the case is complicated by chance. All of the Marines interviewed for this story were close when the grenade exploded, but could only hear it and respond. Carpenter said he doesnt remember what happened, and Eufrazio has been unable to speak about the incident due brain damage he suffered as a complication.\n The photograph at the head of this article was taken in the South Carolina state Senate chamber in March 2011, where Sen. Jake Knotts presented a proclamation honoring Lance Cpl. Carpenter. The woman in the background is Kyle's mother, Robin Carpenter. The preface quoted above includes the commonly repeated erroneous claim that members of Congress \"receive full-pay retirement after serving one term.\" As detailed in our article on this topic, Congressional pensions are based on a number of factors, one of which is length of service. pensions Last updated:  10 April 2012\n    Lamothe, Dan.  \"Marine Hit by Grenade Rates MoH, Buddies Say.\"\n   Marine Corps Times.  29 January 2012.

At that time, the dolphin's death was attributed solely to the couple's playing with the marine creature on shore rather than returning it to the water, and none of the discussion claimed that the dolphin's purported death was a result of the woman shown in the photographs (or anyone else) having urinated on it:   WTF Guy and Girl find dolphin on shore, they decide to take silly pictures with it instead of letting it back into ocean. Dolphin dies shortly after. The Reddit thread in question received hundreds of comments when it was active, but contributors provided little hard information about the origin of the pictures. A few users shared links to news stories, one of which was published by a Peruvian website on 5 March 2014, but that report provided little background and was largely speculative in tone:   published Photographs of a couple posing next to a small dolphin have caused outrage. In the images two young people, identified as Judith and Dick, are seen holding the dolphin, lifting its tail, and even sitting astride it. Although the location of the beach or the exact date on which the pictures were recorded has not yet identified, it was learned that after this abuse the dolphin died. Other commenters say the dolphin was already dead. The photograph reemerged on Facebook on 16 May 2015, followed several days later by anews articlethat identified the individuals depicted as \"tourists\" but provided no new information about the story behind the images. Facebook article Though the photographs (and their attendant appeal to identify the youths involved) have proved cyclically popular on social media cites, what came to be called the \"Lima dolphin incident\" was largely resolved by 8 March 2014, when a news site in Peru located and spoke to the individuals depicted(identified as Judith Uriol Maribel Silva and Jonathan Ramos Torres) about the incident. According to Uriol Silva and Ramos Torres, the dolphin was already dead at the time the photographs were taken:   spoke Judith Uriol Maribel Silva, the woman who was photographed with his lover loading and sitting atop a dolphin apologized to the country. Speaking to ATV channel, Uriol Silva apologized for what [they]did with [friend]Jonathan Ramos Torres. \"I made a mistake in publishing this. If anything I have [done has] offended anyone, I apologize,\" he said. The woman said that they found the dolphin dead in January at San Pedro beach in Chiclayo. \"The animal was in shallow water, not moving. We carried it to the beach and took photos. That day there were many dead dolphins on the beach,\" she said. That statement is consistent with documentedincidenceof dolphin deaths in Peru that took place in early 2014. Immediately prior to the first online appearance of these photographs, theBBC had reported upon a rash of dolphin deaths in Chiclayo: precisely where the images were said to have originated:   reported Residents of Chiclayo, on the northern coast of Peru, have found hundreds of dead dolphins over an area 66 miles long in the last week. The region known as Lambayeque is located nearly 500 miles north of Lima, the Peruvian capital. The authorities are still investigating the cause of the deaths and have not yet ruled out the possibility of hunting killings. Additional reportsof dolphin deaths in Peru were published in January and February of 2014, the time period during which Uriol Silva said the controversial photographs were taken. reports On 16 February 2016, news reports from Argentina showed a group of people on a Buenos Aires beach handling a baby dolphin and passing it around for photographs:    Argentina news outletLa Nacin (and other news outlets)citeda report from VidaSilvestre, a conservationgroup, stating that the animal (a rare Franciscana, also known as a La Plata dolphin) died of dehydration not long afterward. news cited stating Franciscana Barakat Chavez, Pier. \"Mujer Que Se Fotografi Con Delfn Varado Pidi Perdn.\"  \r\n  El Comercio.  8 March 2014\r\n\r\n Chicoma, P. \"Parejita Juega con Delfn en la Playa.\"  \r\n  Trome.pe. 5 March 2015.\r\n\r\n Nelson, Sarah.  \"Dolphin Abuse Pictures Showing Tourists Riding and Hoisting Mammal Go Viral.\"  \r\n  Huffington Post UK. 22 May 2015.\r\n\r\n Saul, Heather. \"Over 400 Dead Dolphins Wash Up on Northern Peru Beaches.\"  \r\n  The Independent.  5 February 2014.\r\n\r\n BBC News.  \"Over 200 Dead Dolphins Washed Ashore in Peru.\"  \r\n  10 February 2014.",

In China, people understood influencers' power, and they are trying to be ready for the future. Special training is held to teach people how to become professional influencers. TinEye reverse image searchresults indicated that the video had circulated on Reddit since 2020. We checked Baidu, the most popular search engine in China, and reverse image searchresults showed that many similar videos were posted on various Chinese websites. results Reddit results similar videos posted   (Baidu search engine) For instance, a video from the same event was published on Weishi, aChinese social media app, and its caption read \"\" which means \"Teaching and shooting now.\" Another caption read \"E-commerce entrepreneurship, online celebrity live broadcast shooting training site.\" The comments on other similar videos published on Weishi indicated that the video was captured in early November 2020. published read published The video in question was originally publishedon Nov. 6, 2020, by @zj1606571983user on Douyin (a Chinese version of TikTok). It reached 59 thousand views and over 8 thousand comments. Its caption read \"\" which translates to \"Internet celebrity training.\" The same user posted a similar video captioned \"60-year-old internet celebrity grandma\" (we translated the captions from Chinese using Google Translate). published Some articles indicated that the footage was captured in Yiwu Industrial & Commercial College in Zhejiang,China. Moreover, various websites such as Business Insidercited a 2017 article published by Mashable about the Chinese college training future influencers, that read: indicated Business Insider article At the YWICC, students are practicing in dance studios and being taught how to dress fashionably. 21-year-old Mengna Jiang is one of 33 students -- mostly women -- majoring in the school's Modelling and Etiquette course. Students who complete three years of the course will be awarded with an associate degree. To cut it as an influencer, you'll need to know, for a start: \"aesthetic cultivation\" and \"fashion sensitivity\"; \"public relations etiquette\" and photo processing skills. What's more, we found a BBC videofrom 2019 with the title \"Inside China's child pop star factory,\" about a young girl that attended an idol training: video Young, mostly female, wannabe stars are being trained for China's booming idol industry worth billions of dollars. Yang Jingxin, 12, became an idol trainee three years ago. Every weekend, she trains with her agency on singing and dancing in the southern suburbs of Beijing. She is hoping to become a future star. But how likely is it for her to succeed in the highly competitive industry? However, according to our research, the in-question video was not captured atYiwu Industrial & Commercial College. Rather, it documented an influencer training session in China organized by a private company. Sohu, a Chinese Internet company, used a screenshot from the video in question in an article regarding influencer trainings in Daxing, a district of Beijing, the capital of China. Here you can read a fragment of the article that we translated from Chinese using Google Translate: article The completion of the Starlight Internet Celebrity Check-in Base will once again improve the quality and upgrade of cultural entertainment, patriotic education, theatrical performances, and Internet celebrity anchor live broadcasts in the Daxing region! Importantly, no university or school was mentioned in the article. Videos from the event indicated that it was organized or sponsored by Shezi(), a Chinese cosmetic brand. Moreover, we found multiple Chinese websitesand social media postsmarketing influencer training camps and events, some of them using screenshots from videos similar to the one in question.

        "justification": "Claim:  Photographs show human remains discovered inside a crocodile. UNDETERMINED Example:  [Collected via e-mail, November 2007] \nHindsight being what it is, an unidentified thief (allegedly) burglarizing cars behind the Miccosukee Indian Reservation in Dade County, Florida might have picked a different hunting ground had he known that he'd become the hunted. And we mean that in the most literal sense. You see, witnesses called the cops on the burglar while he was breaking into cars, and the boys in blue arrived on the scene and gave chase. Hoping to elude the fuzz, the suspect dove into a pond behind the resort and casino where he was greeted by a 9-foot alligator unfamiliar with the concept of Miranda rights. Unfortunately for the suspected burglar, the gator was of the aggressive and unpleasant variety, and thus, a law-breaking career came to a grisly and unexpected end. He'd have been a lot better off spending the night in the clink instead of heading into the drink. Unfortunately for the gator vigilante, Florida fish & wildlife reps saw to it that he followed his erstwhile prey into the afterlife. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Origins:   As is often the case, the images displayed above appear to be a case of someone's matching up (presumably real) photographs of unknown origin with a similar but completely unrelated news account. These pictures began to circulate via e-mail forward in mid-November 2007 under a title of \"Don't Fish Too Close to the Bank!\", with no accompanying information about when, where, or under what circumstances the photographs were taken.  A few weeks later, they were matched up with a November 2007 news report from Miami, Florida, about a would-be thief who was killed by an alligator while he was fleeing from the police: \n\nA Florida man police said was breaking into cars at Miccosukee Resort and Gaming was attacked and killed by a 9-foot alligator while trying to run from police. Investigators said officers responded to reports of car break-ins at a Miccosukee Indian Reservation parking lot located at 500 S.W. 177th Ave. in Miami. One of the men was quickly captured by officers during the incident last week but the other robbery suspect tried to elude officer by jumping into a large pond behind the facility. During the swim, police said, an alligator attacked and killed the man. He was apparently bitten on the head several times. The victim's body was recovered at the bottom of the pond about a day after the reported break-ins.\n However,  a local television news report of the incident shows that it doesn't match this set of photographs in several particulars: report \n The terrain and surroundings in the photos don't match that of the urban Miami, Florida, resort location (surrounded by casinos, hotels, roads, and parking lots) where the robbery suspect was killed. resort  The animal shown in the photographs is not an alligator but a Nile crocodile, a saurian found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the Nile Basin, and Madagascar, not Florida. crocodile  The Florida robbery suspect was killed by an alligator, but he was not eaten by the reptile.  The Florida alligator was not dispatched and cut open at the scene of the incident; he was captured, transported to the All American Gator facility, and held there pending an inspection by the county medical examiner's office.  (In accordance with state law, the alligator was destroyed once the investigation was complete.)\n Other versions have attempted to match these photographs with a November 2007 account of a crocodile killed by villagers in eastern Indonesia after several people went missing in the area, a saurian which was found to have human remains inside it: \n\nVillagers found two human hands, a leg and a pair of shorts inside a half-ton crocodile they trapped and killed in eastern Indonesia, a conservationist said.  At least five people have gone missing in recent months in the same area of East Nusa Tenggara province and are believed to have been eaten by a crocodile or crocodiles, said local conservationist Lorens Mbatu. The 16-foot-long reptile is suspected of having eaten a 59-year-old fisherman, who was last seen a week earlier near a river in the province about 750 miles east of the capital, Jakarta. The villagers who found human body parts inside the captured crocodile's abdomen  along with skull fragments and strands of hair  cut the beast into pieces and shared the meat, Mbatu said. \"People here believe they must eat the flesh of a crocodile that has eaten a human so there will be no more victims,\" he said\n However, we have not found any evidence that definitively links these photographs with the man-eating crocodile killed in Indonesia.  Indeed, the men shown in the top two pictures look like pleased hunters posing with a trophy kill, not Indonesian villagers who have just captured a beast suspected of having eaten several local residents.  At this point we can't even verify that the bottom four pictures (the close-ups showing human remains) were taken at the same time and place as the two photographs of the men posing with the captured croc. \n\n\n\n  Last updated:  14 September 2013\n    Associated Press.  \"Human Remains Found in Slain Indonesia Croc.\"\n   ESPN.com.  6 December 2007.\n",

TRUE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, July 2008] \n Origins:  Skewering a political candidate with an apropos comment is a time-honored way of making a point. Of late, we're seeing this tradition expand into the online world of blogs and message boards but also into the offline world via signage on businesses. The sign pictured above was displayed outside the Mandeville, Louisiana, office of State Farm Insurance agent Bud Gregg.  The sign actually bore different legends on each side, one side displaying the \"chicken\" message shown above and the other side referencing an apocryphal quote attributed to Senator Obama about his hoping to change \"the greatest nation in the history of the world\": change \n\n A State Farm representative said that Bud Gregg's office sign bore these messages until 3 July 2008 and that the company had requested the sign be removed as soon as they became aware of it because the sign was inconsistent with State Farm's policy of not endorsing candidates or taking sides in political campaigns. Both signs are reminiscent of the KFC offering lampooning Senator Hillary Clinton. KFC offering However, although this particular insurance vendor posted the \"like a chicken voting for Colonel Sanders\" billboard, he most certainly wasn't the first to get off this zinger. That withering assessment has been leveled at numerous U.S. and Canadian politicians over the years: \n\n[Moseley, October 2004] If you are on Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, a baby-boomer, unemployed, a minority, parent with school-aged children, a college student, without medical insurance, balancing your personal budget, not a CEO, purchasing gasoline, wanting clean air and water, a 401-K owner or earn less than $200,000 per year, then voting for George Bush is like a chicken voting for Colonel Sanders.\n \n [Carville, January 2003] The previous highest-ranking black official was Mr. JC Watts from Oklahoma. Do you know what his own father said? A black person voting for a Republican would be like a chicken voting for Colonel Sanders.\n \n [Charleston Daily Mail, October 1996] Any hardworking person who votes Republican is like the chicken voting for Colonel Sanders.\n \n [Rogers, March 1996] When workers voted for Mike Harris [Premier of Ontario, 1995-2002], it was like the chickens voting for Colonel Sanders.\n \n [United Press International, October 1984] A working man voting for Reagan is like a chicken voting for Colonel Sanders.\n \n [Waters, November 1982] For all that, Brinkley got off the evening's snappiest line: \"Auto workers voting for Republicans this year are like chickens voting for Colonel Sanders.\"\n \n [Feinstein, October 1982] [Michael] Barnes told the gathering of about 150 union leaders and members that \"for a working man or woman in this country to vote Republican in 1982 would be a like a chicken voting for Colonel Sanders.\"\n \n [Sheppard, October 1978] Mr. [Steven] Langdon [NDP candidate in Ottawa Centre riding] told an audience that for Ottawa Centre to vote Tory [Progressive Conservative] is like a chicken voting for Colonel Sanders.\n One of Bud Gregg's messages inspired a realtor in Texas to post the same sentiment on a sign outside his business:  Bob Costilow, the owner of Bob Costilow Realtors in Nederland, Texas, said he was appalled by the capital gains tax portion of Senator Obama's tax plan. \"I saw it (i.e., the \"chicken\" saying) in an e-mail on a sign put up by a State Farm agent in Mandeville, Louisiana,\" he said. \"I loved it.

        "justification": "On 5 July 2016, the web site Southern Conservative Daily published a very brief post reporting that President Obama planned to \"remove\" the Statue of Liberty because it was \"offensive to Muslims.\"  Although the headline of the article stated as much, its body read as follows: post President Barack Obama warned late Monday afternoon that if the House of Representatives did not agree to a continuing resolution to fund the government after midnight that did not curtail the implementation of Obamacare  and that he would therefore agree to sign  the Statue of Liberty would be immediately closed. A 1 July 2010 clip of President Obama talking about the Statue of Liberty was attached to the article, during which the President did not mention removing the landmark or describe it as offensive to Muslims:  The article did not explain exactly how the Statue of Liberty might offend Muslims, but the rumor was taken at face value by many social media users despite that omission. Needless to say, no news reports have suggested that President Obama has any designs to do anything to the Statue of Liberty, much less plans to close or remove it. The rumor wasn't new in July 2016, as a few months earlier the web site Departed.co published the same article verbatim and also asserted that the President had made such a claim on \"Monday.\" As it turned out, the sentence was a snippet taken from a 30 September 2013 CNSNews article which itself misleadingly presented President Obama's comments on a looming government shutdown:   article article President Barack Obama warned late Monday afternoon that if the House of Representatives did not agree to a continuing resolution to fund the government after midnight that did not curtail the implementation of Obamacare  and that he would therefore agree to sign  the Statue of Liberty would be \"immediately closed.\" At the same time, Obama conceded that even if the House refused to pass a CR that allowed the administation to move forward with Obamacare, major government programs would continue. Social Security and Medicare, for example, would go on, and U.S. troops would remain on duty. The linked remarks made by President Obama described the consequences of a government shutdown, not a personal plan of his to do away with the Statue of Liberty: described With regard to operations that will continue: If youre on Social Security, you will keep receiving your checks. If youre on Medicare, your doctor will still see you. Everyones mail will still be delivered. And government operations related to national security or public safety will go on. Our troops will continue to serve with skill, honor, and courage. Air traffic controllers, prison guards, those who are with border control -- our Border Patrol will remain on their posts, but their paychecks will be delayed until the government reopens. NASA will shut down almost entirely, but Mission Control will remain open to support the astronauts serving on the Space Station. I also want to be very clear about what would change. Office buildings would close. Paychecks would be delayed. Vital services that seniors and veterans, women and children, businesses and our economy depend on would be hamstrung. Business owners would see delays in raising capital, seeking infrastructure permits, or rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy. Veterans whove sacrificed for their country will find their support centers unstaffed. Tourists will find every one of Americas national parks and monuments, from Yosemite to the Smithsonian to the Statue of Liberty, immediately closed. And of course, the communities and small businesses that rely on these national treasures for their livelihoods will be out of customers and out of luck. And in keeping with the broad ramifications of a shutdown, I think its important that everybody understand the federal government is Americas largest employer. More than 2 million civilian workers and 1.4 million active-duty military serve in all 50 states and all around the world. In the event of a government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of these dedicated public servants who stay on the job will do so without pay  and several hundred thousand more will be immediately and indefinitely furloughed without pay.

        "justification": "To those who have not witnessed the spectacle themselves (or have merely viewed photographs of it with no explanatory context), the sight of hundreds of Muslims praying in the middle of Manhattan's streets is likely a startling image. Although the pictures are real, they depict a phenomenon that has been taking place regularly for many years and long antedates the presidency of Barack Obama. Example:  [Collected via e-mail, July 2010] Not only London, Paris and Barcelona FRIGHTENING SITUATION - OBAMA IS CHANGING THE FACE OF THE USA PLEASE SEND THIS TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW ON EVERY WEB SITE YOU ALSO CHAT IN. THIS IS NOT A JOKE - IT IS HAPPENING!!! This is an accurate picture of every Friday afternoon in several locations throughout NYC where there are mosques with a large\nnumber of Muslims that cannot fit into the mosque - They fill the surrounding streets, facing east for a couple of hours between\nabout 2 & 4 p.m. - Besides this one at 42nd St & Madison Ave, there is another, even larger group, at 94th St & 3rd Ave, etc., etc. - Also, I presume, you are aware of the dispute over building another \"high rise\" Mosque a few blocks from \"ground zero\" - With regard to that one, the \"Imam\" refuses to disclose where the $110 million dollars to build it is coming from and there is a lawsuit filed to force disclosure of that information - November can't come soon enough This is in New York City on Madison Avenue, not in France or the Middle East or Yemen or Kenya. Is there a message here???? Yes, there is, and they are claiming America for Allah. If we don't wake up soon, we are going to \"politically correct\" ourselves right out of our own country! A Christian Nation cannot put up a Christmas scene of the baby Jesus in a public place, but the Muslims can stop normal traffic every Friday afternoon by worshiping in the streets.... Something is happening in America that is reminiscent of what is happening in Europe. This is Political Correctness gone crazy... \"For evil to flourish, all that is needed is for good people to do nothing.\" Edmund Burke     These photos originated with New York City's annual American Muslim Day Parade, an event first held in 1985 (long before Barack Obama entered the world of politics) and every year since. As the parade's organizers note of its history: Muslim Day Parade New York City is the capital of the world and center of center of economic, business, social and cultural activities. When it comes to social and cultural activities, it houses many ethnic groups from around the world such as Irish, Italian, Latin, Afro-American, Catholic, Jewish and Muslim. Up until 1985, all these groups were celebrating their ethic and cultural heritage in one form or the other, which included street activities, festivals and parades, with the exception of the Muslims.So, in 1984, a few Muslim brothers got together, thought that when there are so many cultural shows and parades are being held in the City then Muslims should also demonstrate their different cultural beauties along with our Islamic values. Muslim representation in the City and State was zero. So they planned about having a United American Muslim Day Parade in New York City which will provide a platform to the Muslim community in this Tri-State area to get together and join the main stream political arena of this country as we have adopted it as our homeland. We are here for good; our children have to carry on our Islamic Values in the future when we will be gone. Late Zakaullah Pirzada, late Imam Qasim Bakiruddin, late Dr. Abdul Quddus, Br. Mohammad A Munim, Dr. Shafi Bezar, Dr. Rashid Jafar and many others were the founding members who organized and incorporated the Muslim Foundation of America, Inc. in 1984, which is a tax-exempt, not-for-profit organization. MFA Inc. organized its first Muslim Day Parade in 1985 and since then we have been dutifully holding this parade every year on the last Sunday of September. Our parade always has an Islamic theme and a Muslim Grand Marshal. It represents many Muslim nationalities and their cultures. At the end of the parade, we have a bazaar where vendors are selling foods, clothing, books and etc. from different countries. Also included are programs for the kids. The photographs displayed above were taken at the 2009 Muslim Day Parade:  As noted above, the event depicted in the four photographs is an annual one, not a weekly one, and the participating group obtains the required parade permits from New York City authorities.",

We did some quick digging and, as expected, were able to confirm that scammers were behind these posts. Mars was not giving away money on Facebook, nor did he have anything to do with the scam. In the past, we witnessed these same kinds of scam giveaways using the photo and likeness of former talk show host Ellen DeGeneres. There were so many of these scams for \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" for so many years that we reported about them on three separate occasions. three separate occasions As for Mars, we found Facebook posts that asked, in all capital letters, \"What's your birth month to qualify for today's giveaway?\" It read like this: \"WHAT\"S Y0UR BIRTH MONTH TO QUALIFY FOR TODAYS GIVEAWAY.\"  In addition to Mars, we found Facebook posts that indicated scammers were pushing the same fake promotions with the photos and likenesses of filmmaker Tyler Perry and musician Garth Brooks. This wasn't the first time we reported about Perry being used in Facebook scams, either. reported  These scams appeared to be hosted by several fairly large and unofficial Bruno Mars Facebook groups, some of which had been created by fans.  After some users believed the scam was real and commented with their birth month, the scammers then directed them in replies to click a link. The links in those replies went to a page on either sites.google.com or blogspot.com. Those pages made the same promise about Mars, Perry, and Brooks holding a giveaway for either $750 in gift cards or $10,000 in cash. A link at the bottom of that landing page then went to a second website that hosted survey scams. Survey scams are a specific kind of ruse. They promise big prizes up front, but then lead to a seemingly endless number of surveys with other tantalizing prize promises. Such survey scams often begin with a big promise of $750 delivered via PayPal or Cash App. Usually, the scammers who create the Facebook posts are hoping that users sign up for accounts on various websites that pop up during the survey scams, as they might land them small amounts of referral commission. At the same time, survey scams also have a chance of being quite dangerous, reported AARP.org: reported AARP.org Amid questions about the supposed subject, sham surveys solicit personal or financial information, such as a credit card number to pay a shipping fee for your prize  something a legit survey will not do. They might trick you into signing up for a free trial offer thats actually a costly subscription for a dietary supplement or other product. Clicking on the link might also launch malware that can scrape sensitive data from your device. Either way, the scammers get information they can use for identity theft or sell on to other bad actors. Some major retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, do offer gift cards as prizes for customers who complete online surveys about their shopping experience, but those companies say they will never ask participants to provide sensitive data. We strongly advise all of our readers to never click any links in offers that seem too good to be true. Also, we recommend sharing this article with family members or friends who might be fans of Mars, Brooks, and Perry, as they might be more susceptible to falling for the scams.

If you are driving at night and are attacked with eggs, do not operate the wiper and  spray and water. Because eggs mixed with water become milky and block your vision up to 92.5% Then you are forced to stop at the road side and become a victim of robbers. This is a new technique used by robbers in Johor Bahru. Please inform your friends and relatives!!  If you are driving at night and eggs are thrown at your windshield. Do not operate the wiper and spray any water because eggs mixed with water become milky and block your vision up to 92.5% so you are forced to stop at the roadside and become a victim of robbers.  This is a new technique used by robbers.  Please inform your friends and relatives. This also happens on interstates near exits.\n That earlier version, while it also asserted the claim of water mixed with raw egg's obscuring a windshield and bruited the (absurdly precise) 92.5% figure, differed from what has become the canonical form of the warning in that it stated motorists so attacked would become prey to \"robbers/carnappers\" and recommended those so assaulted instead drive to \"a well lit place w/ many people or nearest police station\" rather than stop. Later forms of the e-mail added further flourishes, such as \"used by robbers\" morphing into \"used by robbers in Johor Bahru\" (the capital city of Johor in southern Malaysia), the addition of the claim that these attacks \"happens on interstates near exits,\" and most commonly the inclusion of a new paragraph that blamed matters on a flagging economy: \"Folks are becoming more and more cruel daily. But this is just the beginning of pangs of distress. With the decline in economy and job losses, we can expect anything. Just can't be too careful these days.\" Though we've queried our police contacts and scoured news reports looking for accounts of robberies and carjackings effected by disabling target  vehicles by pelting them with raw eggs, we haven't been able to document any such occurrences in the U.S.  (In all the years we've been tracking this legend, the most we've turned up is a single unverified account.)\nRather, we did locate news stories about police cars so pelted, with the officers retaliating by giving chase to the miscreants who'd thrown eggs at them. In various news accounts we found, officers not only were able to see well enough through their poultrified windows to go after the bad guys, they also succeeded in running them to ground and bringing them to justice. Most tellingly, such accounts made no mention of the officers' experiencing difficulty in seeing well enough through their egged windshields to give chase. unverified While a mixture of raw egg and water vigorously stirred together in a glass will produce a somewhat milky-looking liquid (which might be the source of this tale), there's nothing about the interaction of egg and water that renders the resulting combination into a substance guaranteed to completely block a driver's vision. Egg alone or egg-and-water solutions are thin liquids and so are relatively easy to see through, with the vehicle's wipers generally sweeping away the worst of the mess fairly easily, as demonstrated in the following video: It would take a number of extremely well-placed eggs (a hen's typical offerings aren't that big) to splat a windshield so thoroughly as to completely impair the driver's view and force him to stop immediately. Unless the visibility conditions were already poor, a motorist with a splattered windshield would generally still be able to see well enough to continue driving out of range of the egg-throwing hooligans to a safe stopping place. Certainly miscreants have long engaged in the practice of launching objects (rocks, eggs, firecrackers, paintballs) at moving cars in order to startle motorists into stopping and getting out of their automobiles (typically as a prank, but sometimes as a means of setting up the theft of a vehicle and/or the driver's possessions), but that information is neither new nor shocking. <!--\n<FONT COLOR=>Variations:  \n A March 2010 version combined the \"eggs being thrown at motorists' windshields\" warning with one about a fake baby in a blood soaked car seat. baby  A November 2012 version included a photograph of a car's windshield that had some sort of white spatter upon it that looked to us to be white paint:\n\n\n\n--> Fernandez, Lisa.  \"Off-Duty San Jose Cop Stops Three Men for Vandalizing His Car in Fremont.\"\r\n  San Jose Mercury News.  1 November 2007.\r\n Hoober, John.  \"Egg Tossed at Cruiser Leads to Chase, Crash.\"\r\n  Lancaster New Era.  3 December 2008  (p.

        ],
        "justification": "In July 2016, a gold miner in the Klondike goldfields of the Canadian Yukon who was thawing frozen ground and mud to locate placer deposits came upon a much furrier, historically valuable discovery. Locked in the permafrost were the perfectly preserved remains of a wolf pup that had died an estimated 57,000 years ago. And in December 2020, researchers at Des Moines University characterized the worlds most complete wolf mummy in the scientific journal, Current Biology. July 2016 Current Biology Now named Zhr, which means wolf in the local language of the Tr'ondk Hwch people, the pup is believed to be a Pleistocene gray wolf who died at the age of about seven weeks. Zhr was so well preserved at the time of her death that her skin, fur, and the papillae on her lips are all still visible. \"She's the most complete wolf mummy that's ever been found. She's basically 100% intact -- all that's missing are her eyes,\" said study author Julie Meachen, an associate professor of anatomy at Des Moines University in a news release. \"And the fact that she's so complete allowed us to do so many lines of inquiry on her to basically reconstruct her life.\" news release Zhr measured just 14 inches long and weighed under 1.5 pounds. Morphometric, isotopic, and genetic analyses of the pup provided details of her appearance and evolutionary relationship to wolves  all of which contributed to understanding how the young canine died. \"It's rare to find these mummies in the Yukon. The animal has to die in a permafrost location, where the ground is frozen all the time, and they have to get buried very quickly, like any other fossilization process,\" said Meachen. \"If it lays out on the frozen tundra too long it'll decompose or get eaten.\" But how did Zhr die? To find out, Meachen and her team first needed to determine how the pup lived.  Current Biology  Current Biology As a mammal ages, its bones fuse together, helping researchers to determine an animals age. Radiographs of the canines skeleton showed that the epiphyses and epiphyseal plates (also known as the growth plates) located at the end of long bones had partially fused. By comparing it to the growth rate of a domestic dog, the researchers were able to determine that Zhr was just under two months when she died. Based on the birthing cycle of modern wolves, its likely that her den collapsed in July or early August. In order to determine when Zhr died, researchers turned to radiocarbon dating, a method that analyzes the level of three carbon isotopes in an organic item  like a wolf mummy  and compares it to the amount of carbon in the atmosphere through geological history. In short, a mummys level of carbon isotopes will by and large match carbon in the atmosphere at the time of death. An analysis of Zhrs DNA from hair follicles and oxygen isotopes from tooth enamel suggests that she lived and died between 56,000 and 57,000 years ago. radiocarbon dating Her DNA suggests that Zhr likely descended from ancient gray wolves in Russia, Siberia, and Alaska. This evolutionary group, or clade, also includes individuals from Eurasia and North America, a finding that provides further evidence to suggest that the continents were connected during the Pleistocene epoch by way of a giant swath of ice known as the Bering Land Bridge. But because Zhrs DNA does not prove she is a direct ancestor of gray wolves in Canada today, it is thought that wolves in the area experienced at least one wave of regional extinction before being replaced by another subgroup. Understanding Zhrs relationship to modern-day wolves helps to paint a bigger picture of her time on Earth. Using that information, the researchers analyzed her diet and determined it was heavily influenced by how closely she lived to the water. Her diet largely consisted of aquatic resources, particularly salmon. This particular area of the Klondike River where she was found is a spawning ground for king salmon and a feeding area for wolves of today. Because the pup had a mouth full of teeth and was otherwise healthy at the time of her death, in addition to her high level of preservation, the scientists concluded that she likely died instantly when her den collapsed. But the discovery also presented as many questions as it did insights. Why was Zhr the only wolf found in the den? What happened to her parents or siblings? Could it have been that she was an only pup, or was she the only one present when the den collapsed? Answers to these questions may never be found, but viewing Zhr has been made possible by the Tr'ondk Hwch'in people, who placed the pup on display in December 2020 at the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Center in Whitehorse, the capital city of Yukon.

However, worry not, Disney Parks fans -- this was nothing more than satire from a fun-filled Disney blog. The video came from TikTok user @mousetrapnews: video   During the video, the narrator said that Cinderella Castle would be removed from Disney World and that \"the announcement came out of the blue\": Breaking Disney news. Cinderella Castle will be removed after the 50th anniversary. As you can see, the Magic Kingdom will look empty without the castle. This announcement came out of the blue and is devastating, and there are no mentions from Disney as to what might be replacing it.

Several commenters who received quite a few likes on their remarks appeared to believe that the news was real. \"The Magic Kingdom Castle is the whole part of Walt Disney World,\" one person posted. Another user commented in all capital letters, saying, \"THEY BETTER NOT REMOVE CINDERELLA'S CASTLE. CINDERELLA IS MY FAVORITE PRINCESS AND THE ONLY REASON I REALLY GO TO DISNEY ANYMORE.\" A third person said, \"Why?! It is an iconic piece of Disney.\" There was no shortage of similar comments. At the end of the TikTok video, viewers were asked to visit The Mouse Trap blog on mousetrapnews.com for more details. Part of the article read as follows: article BREAKING: Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom Will be Removed After 50th Anniversary ... A huge Disney announcement just broke that they would be removing Cinderella Castle from the Magic Kingdom at Disney World. No longer will you walk down Main Street USA and see the towering castle. This announcement seemingly came out of nowhere. There was no indication prior to this announcement that Cinderella Castle would be removed. In fact, most people assumed the castle would never be removed or replaced given how iconic it is for Disney. Every Magic Kingdom park equivalent around the world has a castle, which makes it even more amazing they are removing it at Magic Kingdom. It is possible Disney removes the castles at each Disney park around the world, like Sleeping Beauty castle at Disneyland for example. For now only Magic Kingdom is losing their beloved castle and as you can see in the image below, Main Street USA and the Magic Kingdom look bare without Cinderella Castle.

            "Fear-mongering Facebook memes misrepresented the position articulated by the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in a speech in July 2020."
        ],
        "justification": "In the summer of 2020, multiple readers asked Snopes to investigate claims that former U.S. Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden had called for an end to \"shareholder capitalism.\" In July and August, Facebook users shared posts that contained the following text: users shared posts \"Biden wants to end Shareholder Capitalism...that's your 401[k]...your pensions...your retirement...are you voting for that?\"   Another social media meme suggested that Biden's proposals would result in the destruction or liquidation of 401(k) pension savings:   Those memes did not accurately reflect remarks made by Biden in July 2020 on the subject of \"shareholder capitalism.\" At a July 9 event in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, Biden gave a relatively conventional stump speech, hitting on several familiar themes  his working-class upbringing in nearby Scranton, the values he inherited from his family, and his vision for an American economy that, according to him, places less emphasis on corporate profit, and a greater emphasis on rewarding hard work and smaller-scale entrepreneurship, especially in the context of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, which devastated some smaller businesses and left millions unemployed.  As part of this broader \"Wall Street versus Main Street\" theme, Biden said the following (emphasis added): theme Enough is enough, it's time reverse the priorities in this country. It's time to help small businesses, middle-class folks, manage their way through a pandemic, and let's help millions of would-be entrepreneurs get out from under their debts so they can start businesses. And it's time corporate America paid their fair share of taxes...The days of Amazon paying nothing in federal income tax will be over. Let's make sure that workers have a power, and the voice. It's way past time to put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism  the idea [that] the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders. That's simply not true, it's an absolute farce. They have responsibility to their workers, their community, to their country. That isn't [a] new or radical notion. These are basic values and principles that helped build this nation in the first instance. Now the challenge is to take these fundamental values, and apply them to the new economy we have to build in the years ahead...\"  Biden did not propose dissolving the stock market, or prohibiting the public trading of companies, or shareholder investment and dividend. In saying \"It's way past time to put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism,\" Biden was taking a position in a long-running ethical debate between \"shareholder\" and \"stakeholder\" theories. One academic has helpfully summed up that philosophical conflict as follows: summed up Shareholder theory asserts that shareholders advance capital to a companys managers, who are supposed to spend corporate funds only in ways that have been authorized by the shareholders. As Milton Friedman wrote, \"There is one and only one social responsibility of business  to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it  engages in open and free competition, without deception or fraud.\" wrote On the other hand, stakeholder theory asserts that managers have a duty to both the corporations shareholders and \"individuals and constituencies that contribute, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to [a companys] wealth-creating capacity and activities, and who are therefore its potential beneficiaries and/or risk bearers.\" Although there is some debate regarding which stakeholders deserve consideration, a widely accepted interpretation refers to shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and the local community. In the short video below, philosopher and professor of business administration R. Edward Freeman  arguably the primary advocate for stakeholder theory  outlines the approach:  Biden characterized the era of shareholder capitalism as one in which the following idea holds sway  \"[that] the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders.\" His rejection of that principle was classic stakeholder theory: \"That's simply not true, it's an absolute farce. They [companies] have responsibility to their workers, their community, to their country.\" We asked the Biden campaign for details on any specific proposals the former vice president had, or how exactly he envisioned an end to \"the era of shareholder capitalism,\" but we did not receive a response in time for publication.  Although those details were not available, it's clear that Biden was not calling for the abolition of shareholding itself. Rather, he proposed bringing an end to the era of shareholder capitalism, meaning an end to the predominance of that particular ethical approach and a new gravitation towards the stakeholder-driven approach, a position that, whether or not one agrees with its tenets, has in recent years become orthodox among progressives, within the Democratic party, and even among business leaders themselves. In 2019, for example, the Business Roundtable  an influential group of chief executive officers of some of the largest companies in the United States  executed a high-profile shift in its approach, writing: writing \"Since 1978, Business Roundtable has periodically issued Principles of Corporate Governance that include language on the purpose of a corporation. Each version of that document issued since 1997 has stated that corporations exist principally to serve their shareholders. It has become clear that this language on corporate purpose does not accurately describe the ways in which we and our fellow CEOs endeavor every day to create value for all our stakeholders, whose long-term interests are inseparable.\" What Biden called for in his Dunmore speech was therefore, as he rightly said, not a \"new or radical notion.\" It was not an end to the stock market nor the ability of individuals to buy and sell shares, and therefore it was not a proposal that would cause pensions to evaporate, as several Facebook memes falsely claimed.

That earlier version, while it also asserted the claim of water mixed with raw egg's obscuring a windshield and bruited the (absurdly precise) 92.5% figure, differed from what has become the canonical form of the warning in that it stated motorists so attacked would become prey to \"robbers/carnappers\" and recommended those so assaulted instead drive to \"a well lit place w/ many people or nearest police station\" rather than stop. Later forms of the e-mail added further flourishes, such as \"used by robbers\" morphing into \"used by robbers in Johor Bahru\" (the capital city of Johor in southern Malaysia), the addition of the claim that these attacks \"happens on interstates near exits,\" and most commonly the inclusion of this new paragraph which blames matters on the flagging economy: \"Folks are becoming more and more cruel daily. But this is just the beginning of pangs of distress. With the decline in economy and job losses, we can expect anything. Just can't be too careful these days.\" Though we've queried our police contacts and scoured news reports looking for accounts of robberies and carjackings effected by disabling target  vehicles by pelting them with raw eggs, we weren't able to find any such occurrences in the U.S. Rather, we did locate news stories about police cars so pelted, with the officers retaliating by giving chase to the miscreants who'd thrown eggs at them. In various news accounts we found, officers not only were able to see well enough through their poultrified windows to go after the bad guys, they succeeded in running them to ground and bringing them to justice. Most tellingly, such accounts made no mention of the gendarmes so assaulted experiencing difficulty in seeing well enough through their egged windshields to give chase. While a mixture of raw egg and water vigorously stirred together in a glass will produce a somewhat milky-looking liquid (which might be the source of this tale), there's nothing about the interaction of egg and water that renders the resulting combination into a substance guaranteed to completely block a driver's vision. Egg alone or egg-and-water solutions are thin liquids and so are relatively easy to see through, with the vehicle's wipers generally sweeping away the worst of the mess fairly easily. Moreover, it would take a number of extremely well-placed eggs (a hen's typical offerings aren't that big) to splat a windshield so thoroughly as to completely impair the driver's view and force him to stop immediately  unless the visibility conditions were already poor, a motorist with a splattered windshield would generally still be able to see well enough to continue driving out of range of the egg-throwing hooligans to a safe stopping place. Certainly miscreants have long engaged in the practice of launching objects (rocks, eggs, firecrackers, paintballs) at moving cars in order to startle motorists into stopping and getting out of their automobiles (typically as a prank, but sometimes as a means of setting up the theft of a vehicle and/or the driver's possessions), but that information is neither new nor shocking.

            "Legends about lunatic asylums, buses, and mistaken identities."
        ],
        "justification": "Legend:   Sane people are mistaken for lunatic asylum inmates. Examples:  \n\n\n[Cerf, 1959] Not so long ago, a Scranton coal tycoon employed a chef named Napoleon whose roasts and sauces were famous for miles around. The president of a nearby university borrowed him one day to cook an important dinner, and Napoleon proudly set forth to fill the engagement, his trusty carving knives wrapped in a piece of old newspaper. He just did catch his bus, and, breathing heavily, instructed the driver, \"Step on the gas, mister. The president is waiting for me.\" The driver looked warily at the carving knives, nodded, \"You're the boss,\" and drove him straight to a lunatic asylum. Thinking this must be the university, the cook unwrapped his knives and announced to the guard at the gate, \"I'm Napoleon. Where's the party?\" Next thing Napoleon knew he was in a padded cell. University officials  plus his employer  rescued Napoleon some eight hours later.\n \n [Collected on the Internet, 1997] HARARE, Zimbabwe (04-04)  After 20 mental patients disappeared from his bus, the driver replaced them with sane citizens and delivered them to a mental hospital.  The unidentified bus driver was transporting 20 mental patients from the capital city of Harare to Bulawayo Mental Hospital when he decided to stop for a few drinks at an illegal roadside liquor store. Upon his return he was shocked to discovered that all the mental patients had escaped.  Desperate for a solution, the driver stopped at the next bus stop and offered free bus rides to several people. He then delivered them to the mental hospital, informing the staff they were easily excitable.  It took the medical personnel three days to uncover the foul play. The real mental patients are still at large.\n Origins:  Stories about the sane being mistaken for the\ninmates of lunatic asylums are as old as the hills, and the two offered above are examples of this theme   transformed into the fabric of humorous anecdotes. The first tale comes from a 1959 funny reminiscences book, so it's unlikely it was ever fully believed as an honest rendition of a sequence of events. (Even the deeply credulous pause at swallowing such a whopper when they encounter it in a joke book!) In common with the \"Napoleon the chef\" story, the second tale hinges on the all-too-believable notion that the utterly sane could be incarcerated by mistake, their sanity not being as obvious to their keepers as they would have otherwise hoped. It fooled many because it purported to be a newspaper article reporting on an actual event. The Zimbabwe bus riders tale appeared on the Internet in April 1997, presented as an item that had come from the 4 April 1997 issue of South Africa's Financial Mail. But of course it hadn't  searches of that paper's archives failed to turn up the story. The yarn was subsequently published in the Weekly World News, a U.S. supermarket tabloid that \"gleefully chronicled the exploits of alien babies, animal-human hybrids and dead celebrities.\"   A related urban legend (minus the humorous overtones of the previous two) tells of psychology students charged with faking their way into a psychiatric care facility by mimicking the symptoms of the truly deranged. Alas, they succeed too well. At what should have been the\nend of the sojourn, they are unable to convince their caregivers that this wild-sounding claim about being psychology students is anything other than the latest manifestation of their manias. Instead of being allowed to leave, they are heavily sedated and restrained. Weeks pass, with the students becoming less and less coherent in their attempts to explain their predicament and less and less sure themselves that they didn't imagine this whole \"psychology student\" episode. By the time others come looking for them and succeed in explaining the assignment, the students are no longer in condition to leave. They themselves have descended into madness.  The  \"maddened students\" tale is pure lore, but the basic premise of sending sane test subjects into such an environment has been tried in real life. In 1973, a group of such subjects presented themselves at psychiatric hospitals, giving a vague complaint about experiencing auditory hallucinations. After the initial assessment, they did not again complain of experiencing symptoms nor did they actively seek discharge. Length of hospitalization ranged from 7 to 52 days, with an average of 19 days, and many of the subjects were diagnosed with schizophrenia.  Another fully rational person managed to get herself incarcerated in such a facility by fooling the intake staff.  In the 1880s, famed New York World reporter Nellie Bly (real name Elizabeth Cochrane) pretended to be insane in order to be committed to the asylum on Blackwell's Island. Her articles about the inhuman conditions brought about a grand jury investigation and important reforms. Oddly enough, a twist on this legend's premise of the sane being mistaken for inmates of a lunatic asylum did play out in real life in 1993 when FBI agents called in to investigate a psychiatric hospital's financial records attempted to arrange delivery of pizzas to feed late-working agents. Upon hearing the order, the pizza parlor contacted quite reasonably assumed the \"agents\" were in fact delusional patients who'd somehow gained access to a phone.

            "Did Jefferson Airplane singer Grace Slick name her daughter 'god'?"
        ],
        "justification": "  Claim:   Jefferson Airplane singer Grace Slick named her daughter 'god.' FALSE Example:s  \n[Feeney, 1996] Smith expressed hope that Madonna will not follow the example of Grace Slick, who named her daughter God in 1971 ... \n \n [Joseph, 1996] The 6 lb. baby, to be known as Hiraani, joins a clique of pop and film star kids blessed or burdened with unlikely names, such as ... God Slick, daughter of Jefferson Airplane duo Grace Slick and Paul Cantner [sic].\n Origins:  Who  but a 1960s drug culture rock star would be sufficiently narcissistic,   audacious, and irreverent enough to irritate millions of Judeo-Christians by naming her daughter 'God'?  Apparently a lot of people around in the early 1970s felt Jefferson Airplane lead singer Grace Slick fit the bill, as so many of them still believe she really did it.  But she didn't.  The name of Grace Slick's daughter is (and always has been) China, and the notion that the little girl was originally named 'God' (or 'god') was purely the product of a joke worked out before her birth. On 25 January 1971, Grace Slick gave birth to a girl at French Hospital in San Francisco.  (The father was one of her Jefferson Airplane bandmates, Paul Kantner.)   As she related in her autobiography, Slick quickly made a joke about her infant daughter's name at the expense of a hospital  nurse: \n\n[A]s I held my newborn baby in my arms, a Spanish nurse came into my hospital room to attend to antiseptics and linens. She was holding a  framed certificate that looked like a high school diploma,  and she said, \"We give these to all the new mothers. You see, it says where she was born, what time, and the name of the baby goes here.\" She pointed to an empty line in the document. \"What is your baby's name?\" she asked. I noticed a crucifix around her neck and spontaneously said, \"god. We spell it with a small g because we want her to be humble.\" It was only a few hours after my baby had arrived, I was holding the miracle of birth in my arms, and I was already messing with somebody's head. The nurse asked me to repeat what I'd said. I obliged her. After hearing it a second time, deciding that the blasphemy was real, she haltingly entered \"god\" on the parchment, probably expecting to go through life repeating novenas for her participation in this profanity. When she was through filling in the irreverent name, she ran to the telephone to call Herb Caen, the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper columnist ... He published the information about the birth and the supposed appellation Paul and I had chosen ... Her real name is China.\n China herself relayed the same story through radio commentator Paul Harvey: \n\nPaul Young of Inglewood recalled reading years ago that singer Grace Slick named her daughter God.  No doubt Young did read that, but Slick's daughter says it's an urban myth.  She told The Times a few years ago that the rumor arose because of a joke Slick made after giving birth.  \"When I popped out,\" her daughter said, \"the nurse was this sort of religious type. In this cutesy voice, she says, 'And what are you naming your baby?' And my mom, being my mom, says wryly, 'We're naming her god, but with a small \"g\" out of respect.'\"  The real first name of Slick's daughter?  China.\n However, not only was the tale about the Slick's deciding to name her daugter 'god' merely a joke that she sprang on an unsuspecting nurse, but it wasn't even a spontaneous jape, as she later claimed.  She was being disingenuous (or was misremembering) about \"spontaneously\" joking to a nurse about naming her child \"god,\" as a Rolling Stone interview with Slick published a full two months before the birth of that child documented she had already worked out that idea: \n\nGrace Slick will be the mother of [Paul Kantner's] child, named god (\"Just 'God,'\" said Grace. \"No last name, no capital G. And he can change his name when he feels like it.\").\n\n Three years earlier, singer Michelle Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas had given her daughter the name China (albeit using the alternate spelling of 'Chynna').    According to Grace Slick, the similarity of names was completely coincidental, however: \n\nSince I never paid much attention to the couplings of other celebrities, I didn't know that Michelle Phillips, another rock-and-roll mom, had named her child Chynna. In fact, I didn't know that Michelle even had a child. Several years after the birth of my daughter, when someone asked me if I'd made the spelling different from the name of Michelle's daughter on purpose, the answer was no. In fact, I was so intent on being original with my daughter's name, if I'd known Michelle's kid was named Chynna, I probably would have called mine Xlopdy.\n\n Baby China appeared on the cover of the 1972 Slick/Kanter album Sunfighter, which included a song about her entitled \"China.\"  Chynna Phillips later teamed up with two of Beach Boy Brian Wilson's daughters to form the musical group Wilson Phillips.

George was unfairly accused of murdering two White girls (Betty 11 and Mary 7), whose bodies had been found not far from the house where the boy and his parents lived. At that time, all the members of the jury were white. The trial lasted 2H30, and the jury made the decision of his sentence after 10 minutes. The boy's parents, threatened, were barred from taking part in the trial after being ordered to leave the city. Prior to his trial, George spent 81 days in detention without the possibility of seeing his parents for the last time. He was imprisoned alone in his cell, 80 kilometers from his hometown. His hearing of the facts was done alone, without the presence of his parents or a lawyer. George's electrocution charge was 5,380 volts on his head. We let you imagine what such an electric shock can have on a young child's head.

(@iam____Myaaaaa) August 16, 2018 August 16, 2018 All these posts included still images taken from a scene from the 1991 TV movie Carolina Skeletons, which told Stinney's story (via a protagonist named \"Linus Bragg\") and was based on David Stout's 1988 novel of the same name. novel On the whole, the account presented in Atansi's Facebook post was very accurate, correctly recounting the major facts of the case and describing several smaller details with a similarly high degree of accuracy. The only significant shortcoming in the account was the presentation of a 2014 court ruling in South Carolina as if it had happened in 2018, and a failure to clearly explain that the judge did not officially \"recognize\" Stinney's \"innocence,\" but rather vacated his conviction on the basis that his trial and sentencing had violated his constitutional due process rights.   The following description of the basic facts of the case is taken from the ruling of Carmen Tevis Mullen, the 14th Judicial District judge in South Carolina who vacated Stinney's conviction in 2014. It contains descriptions of violence against children that some readers might find upsetting: ruling On the afternoon of March 23, 1944, Betty June Binnicker, age 11, and Mary Emma Thames, age 7, failed to return home in the rural town of Alcolu, South Carolina. The next morning, their bodies were discovered lying in a ditch. Both girls' skulls had been crushed and one of the girls' bicycle was lying on top of their bodies, its front wheel detached. George Stinney Jr. was taken into custody a few hours later and confessed to murdering the girls within hours of his apprehension. The Defendant was tried for the murder of Betty June Binnicker on April 24, 1944, just one month after being taken into custody. An all-white male jury was selected and the trial concluded that same day during a special term of court with Judge P.H. Stoll presiding. Appearing on behalf of the State was Solicitor Frank McLeod, who presented evidence from law enforcement that the Defendant confessed to the crime. While law enforcement testified that a confession occurred, no written confession exists in the record today ... The capital murder trial lasted one day. As such, I am best left to conclude that few or no witnesses were called by the Defense and little to no cross examination conducted. After ten minutes of deliberation by the jury of twelve, the Defendant was found guilty of the murder of Betty June Binnicker and was that same day sentenced to death by electrocution. No appeals were filed and no stays of execution were requested by counsel. On June 16, 1944, George Stinney Jr. was executed. He was fourteen years old. Judge Mullen vacated Stinney's conviction some 70 years after his death. Her rationale (set out in detail in her ruling) was that Stinney's constitutional right to due process had been violated on multiple grounds: his confession was likely coerced; his lawyer did woefully little to defend him, especially by failing to call witnesses on his behalf or to appeal his conviction; the selection of the jury did not mitigate against the possibility of racial prejudice playing a role in the verdict; and the execution of a 14-year-old child in and of itself constituted \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" ruling Strictly speaking, Judge Mullen did not exonerate Stinney when she vacated his conviction, despite the 2018 social media claims that \"his innocence has just been officially recognized by a judge in South Carolina.\" Mullen issued something called a writ of coram nobis, which had been requested by Stinney's surviving siblings. (The state of South Carolina contested their petition, claiming that they lacked legal standing to bring it, and that too much time had passed since the conviction.) Coram nobis is a relatively rare type of ruling in which (roughly speaking) a court is presented with facts about an earlier case which, if known at the time, would have been so significant as to make the verdict unreliable or invalid. When such facts emerge, a plaintiff or defendant typically brings a motion for a new trial, but coram nobis is used (in some courts in the United States) when this alternative is not available. In the case of George Stinney, a new trial could not take place because Stinney and potential witnesses are dead, very few documents from the original case have survived, and physical evidence no longer exists. Hence the Stinney family's motion for coram nobis on his behalf. In ordering the writ of coram nobis and vacating Stinney's conviction, Judge Mullen quoted earlier case law and stipulated that her decision was \"not on the grounds that the judgment against him was wrong on the merits, but that the courts have failed in a capital case to discharge their proper functions with due regard to the constitutional safeguards in the administration of justice.\" Despite this distinction between an exoneration and a vacation of conviction, a strong belief that Stinney was innocent of the murders of Betty June Binnicker and Mary Emma Thames is prevalent. His siblings (now aged in their 70s and above) all provided him with an alibi during depositions for the 2014 motion, saying that he had been at home during the time the murders took place and therefore could not have committed them. (Stinney's lawyer Charles H. Plowden and local police failed to interview any of the boy's family at the time of the murders.) Furthermore, the family's lawyers speculated that the murder weapon might have been a \"drift pin,\" a \"twelve-inch long, two-inch wide piece of metal or iron that hitches railroad cars together.\" They invited a local railroad engineer to testify about the implement, which he said could commonly be found on \"log-carrying railroad cars\" or lumber storage yards. This detail dovetailed with a separate theory that the real killer might have been the son of a local sawmill boss (a prominent white man), on whose property the girls' bodies were found. theory The claim that Stinney was the youngest person to be executed in the United States in the 20th century appears to be accurate. A Black teenager named Fortune Ferguson is often reported to have been 13 years old in 1923 when he was convicted and sentenced to death for the rape of an eight-year-old girl in Florida, but his execution (also by electrocution) was stayed and delayed for four years. Furthermore, his age at the time of his conviction is in doubt: one 1924 newspaper article placed him at 17 years old, while a 1927 article put his age at 22 years old at the time of his death. reported four years article article The viral Facebook post is also accurate in its claim that Stinney's family was forced to leave the town of Alcolu after George's arrest. In her 2014 ruling, Judge Mullen wrote: \"Collectively, the testimony [of Stinney's siblings] recounts that the Stinneys were forced to immediately leave town to Pinewood and then Sumter following the Defendant's apprehension, fearful that locals would seek violent revenge against the Stinney family.\" Speaking to NBC News in 2011, Stinney's brother Charles said, \"We had to leave that same night.\" ruling NBC News We can't say whether Stinney \"always had his Bible in his hands\" from the moment of his conviction up until his death, but multiple news articles from 1944 certainly noted that Stinney brought a Bible with him into the execution chamber on 16 June. The Greenville News, for example, reported that Stinney had \"a Bible under his arm\" as he sat in the electric chair. news articles reported It's not clear what was meant by \"[Stinney's] hearing of the facts was done alone, without the presence of his parents or a lawyer.\" We know that the teenager did have a lawyer, Charles H. Plowden, but he appears not to have served his client in any meaningful way, declining to challenge the selection of an all-white jury, failing to bring any witnesses or present any evidence on behalf of Stinney in what was a very short trial, and then opting not to appeal Stinney's conviction and death sentence. The charge applied to Stinney's body during his execution amounted to 4,300 volts in total according to a contemporary news article, not far off the \"5,380 volts\" claimed in the Facebook post. Charles Kelly, whose father was a longstanding chaplain at the South Carolina State Penitentiary and witnessed 34 executions, wrote about Stinney's death in his book Next Stop, Eternity: book The Columbia Record reported the executions of June 16, 1944. The article stated, \"Young Stinney was such a small boy that it was difficult to adjust the electrode to his right leg. After the first charge of 2,400 volts was sent coursing through his body, the death mask slipped from his face and his eyes were open when two additional shots of 1,400 and 500 volts followed.

        "justification": "Claim:  Locked in a war with Westinghouse over which of them would control the future of electric power, Edison worked to discredit his rival's alternating current with claims that it was unsafe  so unsafe that it could be used to kill people. \nStatus:  True.\n Origins:  For those who don't know about the connection between Thomas Edison and the electric chair, here's an excerpt from a 1993 news article: \n\nA court battle under way in California brings to mind one of the more bizarre moments in American science, the birth of the electric chair. Both events, 100 years apart, have to do with that granddaddy of all oxymorons: humane execution. Last week, various experts testified that death in the California gas chamber is (a) swift, painless and merciful, or (b) slow, painful and cruel. The 1880s event saw one of our great American heroes testifying on behalf of electrocution in a way that advanced his own inventions and tainted a rival's work. He was Thomas Alva Edison, already father of the phonograph and the electric light, and the man who would give us the movies. During the early 1880s, Edison put all his energy into a system for delivering electricity. His light bulb had captured the country's imagination, but it was useless without juice. Edison controlled, and profited from, every segment of the system, from generators and cables to motors and light bulbs. Downtown New York City was his first big customer; there was another fortune to be made if other cities signed on. Unfortunately, direct current couldn't be sent more than a few blocks; most users had to have their own noisy generator. Still, DC seemed to be the best thing around, and the magic name of Edison made many ignore the weaknesses. The threat to this dream of profit came from another successful inventor with big money to spend: George Westinghouse, developer of the railroad air brake. By the mid-'80s, his Westinghouse Electric Co. was pushing a delivery system based on alternating current, or AC. AC could be transmitted for many miles; generators could be bigger and fewer, and built far out of earshot, even out of town. Soon Westinghouse was competing with Edison for the franchise in dozens of cities. The contest between the two stubborn and proud tycoon/inventors has been called \"the War of the Currents.\" Fear became a weapon. Edison believed AC was far more dangerous than DC, and soon started a campaign to make AC illegal. He flooded cities with pamphlets warning of AC's danger to families. An aide, H.P. Brown, began experimenting with alternating current \"electricide,\" killing dogs and cats brought to him by local kids who got a quarter per pet. Brown said he was doing research on the dangers of AC, but made sure the press got to watch a killing or two. Up in Albany, the governor saw the accounts. The state had been looking for a better form of execution than hanging, which had been known to cause slow strangulation if the rope was too loose, and to tear the prisoner's head off his body if it was too tight. The Commission on Humane Executions asked Edison for data, but he turned them down; he didn't believe in capital punishment. Later, after thinking it over, he gave his full backing to execution by wire, strongly affirming it as the most humane form of execution. He was even kind enough to recommend the best generator for the job: \"Alternating machines, manufactured principally in this country by George Westinghouse.\" The legislature soon passed a bill making \"electricide\" the official state form of execution. The person who viewed all this with the most interest was William Kemmler, 28, a convicted killer who was next up for execution. Kemmler's lawyer tried to stop the execution, arguing that using electricity would be cruel and unusual punishment. Edison testified for the state, assuring the judge that electrocution would be painless. That was all the judge needed to hear. Kemmler was strapped into the chair on August 6, 1890. The first jolt of alternating current lasted 17 seconds. Kemmler continued struggling. A second jolt lasted more than a minute, until smoke was seen rising from the body. It was, The New York Times said, \"an awful spectacle, far worse than hanging.\" The state commissioner on humane executions saw it differently. It was, he said, \"the grandest success of the age.\" Ira Flatow, the science reporter whose lively 1992 book, They All Laughed . . . has the best account of the Current War, writes: \"Kemmler was more than a victim of his crime; he was a pawn (in) a vicious battle between two giants of the industry  . . . to control the future of electric generation.\" Edison's strange behavior is a good reminder that homicide, whether in war, in the gas chamber or on the mean streets, is likely to be the result of politics, emotion and greed, not the reasoned intent with which we like to credit ourselves.\n Barbara \"shocking!\" Mikkelson Additional information:        History of the Electric Chair   Last updated:  21 July 2007\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n  Hilton, Bruce.  \"Thomas Edison and the Electric Chair.'\"\n\n  The San Francisco Examiner.  13 November 1993  (p.

        ],
        "justification": "On May 18, 2023, a Twitter user shared a photograph of the late physicist Stephen Hawking sitting with a group of people in what appeared to be a tropical setting. The user claimed that Hawking was on the Caribbean island owned by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  In a tweet, @dom_lucre asked, \"Serious question, why the hell was Stephen Hawking on Jeffrey Epstein's Island?\" asked  (@@dom_lucre/X)  This is a real photograph of Hawking that shows him either on one of Epstein's private islands or on nearby St. Thomas Island, at an Epstein-sponsored conference. It was taken in March 2006, a few months before Epstein was charged with multiple counts of unlawful sex with a minor.  March 2006 charged Epstein, a financier who was later charged with sex trafficking, died in his prison cell in 2021 while awaiting trial (he previously had been convicted of other sex offenses). But before his fall, he was known for his parties and his extensive connections with high-profile celebrities, politicians, and intellectuals. He owned two private islands, Great St. James and Little St. James, which were prominent features in the civil and criminal cases against him. Numerous young women said in court papers that they were taken via private jet to Little St. James, where they were ordered to perform sex acts with Epstein and other men.  died owned said Hawking was just one of many scientists and intellectuals invited to these islands for less-sinister reasons  a scientific conference Epstein paid for. So how was Hawking brought into Epstein's orbit? For years, Epstein financed the Edge Foundation, billed as a salon for elite thinkers, which hosted prominent gatherings of scientists and intellectuals, and gave Epstein access to such circles. According to a Buzzfeed News investigation, Epstein's donations helped Edge carry out most of its activities, including an annual \"billionaires dinner\" that ceased to take place after his last contribution in 2015.  financed billed investigation An archived page from Edge.org describing Epstein's involvement can be seen here, where he was described as \"a financier and science philanthropist.\" The website stated, \"He is one of the largest supporters of individual scientists, including theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and Nobel Laureates Gerard 't Hooft, David Gross and Frank Wilczek.\"  Edge.org here In 2006, Epstein sponsored a conference at the neighboring St. Thomas Island. Per a March 2006 report in the St. Thomas Source, a local newspaper, prominent scientists gathered in a series of private meetings dubbed \"Confronting Gravity: A workshop to explore fundamental questions in physics and cosmology.\" Among those scientists was Hawking.  March 2006 Epstein was also described by the local report as the \"driving force behind the conference.\" He reportedly said to the paper that he brought the group to St. Thomas with hopes that the relaxed setting would free the physicists' minds to explore one of the 20th century's last unanswered physics questions: What is gravity? described \"There is no agenda except fun and physics, and that's fun with a capital 'F,'\" Epstein reportedly said. reportedly The New York Times also reported in 2019 on Hawking's trip to this island (emphasis, ours): reported It was a five-day gathering in the Caribbean of some of the world's top scientists, including Dr. Hawking, to share ideas about gravity and cosmology, with scuba and catamaran excursions on the side. One evening, the participants had dinner on the beach at Mr. Epstein's private island. Some of the scientists noticed that Mr. Epstein \"was always followed by a group of something like three or four young women,\" as Alan Guth, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, put it in an email to The Times, but they did not probe further. In another 2019 report, The New York Times described how, \"Once, the scientists  including Mr. Hawking  crowded on board a submarine that Mr. Epstein had chartered.\"  2019 report But where did the photograph come from? In 2006, The Edge Foundation also published a blog post on the conference and interviewed an attendee and organizer, theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss. Per the post (emphasis, ours): The Edge Foundation post The topic of the meeting was \"Confronting Gravity.\" Krauss intended to have \"a meeting where people would look forward to the key issues facing fundamental physics and cosmology\". They could meet, discuss, relax on the beach, and take a trip to the nearby private island retreat of the science philanthropist Jeffrey Epstein, who funded the event. We scrolled to the bottom of the page and found photographs of Hawking and more from the gathering. The photograph in question showed Hawking seated alongside Nobel Prize winner David Gross, and physicists Kip Thorne and Lisa Randall. Yet another shows Hawking on what appears to be the interior of a boat, captioned, \"Lawrence Krauss and Stephen Hawking on the way to Atlantis Submarine.\"  page \n(Screenshot via Edge.org) The New York Times described Epstein's allure for these scientists: The New York Times The lure for some of the scientists was Mr. Epstein's money. He dangled financing for their pet projects. Some of the scientists said that the prospect of financing blinded them to the seriousness of his sexual transgressions, and even led them to give credence to some of Mr. Epstein's half-baked scientific musings. The photograph of Hawking has been disseminated in the media, and is also publicly available on the website of the foundation once financed by Epstein, along with a description of the conference he attended, with the dates and details of the gathering matching up with reliable media reports.

            "A meme used mostly accurate stats to draw a somewhat questionable link between the duration of academy training and the use of deadly force by police."
        ],
        "justification": "The use of deadly force by police officers is the subject of long-standing concern in the United States, and the internet is often the venue for debates about the causes of fatal encounters between law enforcement agents and members of the public. In September 2018, a meme shared on Facebook pointed the finger at one cause in particular for the relatively high rate of police killings in the United States: the length of time required to become a police officer. The meme compared the duration of police academy training and the number of police killings in recent years, in each of three Nordic countries (Norway, Finland, and Iceland) and the United States: meme   This is our overview of the accuracy of those claims: Candidates become police officers in Norway after completing a three-year Bachelor's degree in Police Studies, administered centrally by the Norwegian Police University College in the capital city Oslo. The college's web site describes the training as follows: degree describes The training is professionally orientated and is intended to provide a broad theoretical and practical foundation for police work. The training is based on the principle that all newly qualified policemen/women must be generalists. A generalist is a policeman/woman who possesses basic knowledge and skills pertaining to the polices preventative, crime prevention and civil order work. In solving assignments, generalists shall be able to perform basic police duties, make overall assessments of situations, view their work in a broader social context and engage relevant specialist expertise and partners as required. Generalists shall acquire a basis for continued learning and development through the execution of their profession. In order to be accepted into training, the applicant must meet certain requirements: must be a Norwegian citizen, speak good Norwegian, have a high school degree, and be physically fit and healthy. requirements According to multiple sources, Norwegian police fatally shot four people between 2002 and 2016. In their 2014 annual report, the Norwegian Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs wrote that: annual report Since 2005, the Bureau has investigated 15 cases where injury to a person has occurred as a result of the use of firearms by the police. A total of 16 persons have been injured in such incidents and, in two of these cases, the injuries resulted in death. A further two fatal shootings took place in 2015 and 2016, as detailed by the English-language news website The Local in November 2016: The Local Norwegian police shot and killed a 35-year-old man in Kristiansand, an incredibly rare incident in a nation where fatal police shootings are nearly non-existent ... [The] incident marked just the fourth time that police in Norway have been involved in a fatal shooting since 2002. The most recent incident was in September 2015 when police killed a man in Stange Municipality who shot at officers. That marked the end of a nine-year stretch with no police killings. We did not find any evidence of another police killing in Norway since November 2016. In fact, a three-year Bachelor's degree is required to become a police officer in Finland. The country's Police University College (\"Poliisiammattikorkeakoulu\" in Finnish) outlines the course of study on their web site: web site The 180 credit point qualification qualifies a person to the positions of police officer, such as a Senior Constable. It takes about three years to complete the studies. Students learn practical knowledge and skills needed in police work. Upon graduation, the student has the skills to act as an expert in police work both independently and as a member of multiprofessional teams and has the necessary skills to develop police operations. Although this particular claim in the meme is not fully true, the reality (i.e., a three-year college degree is required, not just a two-year course) even more strongly supports the underlying argument in the meme, that police officers in the Nordic countries undergo longer training programs than their American counterparts. A spokesperson for the National Police Board in Finland provided us a list of nine fatalities attributed to police actions between 2000 and 2018. However, one of those nine deaths involved a tazer, and another involved a police officer's accidentally shooting a prison guard, so seven members of the public were killed (all shot dead) due to actions taken by police since 2000 in Finland. list The National Police Board spokesperson also provided somewhat extraordinary figures for the use of firearms in Finland in recent years: \"Between 2003 and 2013, there were a total of 385 gunfire situations where 122 rounds where fired altogether. The number of weapon use situations ranged from 26 to 44 on an annual basis.\" So in the decade between 2003 and 2013, the entire national police force in Finland fired an average of 12 bullets per year, between them. Up until 2016, police training in Iceland was conducted at the country's police academy, but for the past two years becoming a member of the Icelandic police requires a two-year college diploma in Police Science from a program run exclusively by the University of Akureyri in the northern part of the island. member The university's web site describes the two-year program as follows: describes Police Science is a practical academic discipline that studies the foundations, nature, and practice of policing. Students learn about the sources of consensus, conflict, and crime; personal freedom, diversity, and human rights; ethics, social control, and laws; the structure of the criminal justice system and its connection to other institutions; the aims, organizations, and tasks of the police; knowledge-based police approaches and techniques; police investigations; prioritizing of daily tasks; communication with other first responders and suspects, victims, witnesses, and the public. In addition, prospective police officers receive extensive practical training with the Centre for Police Training and Professional Development in cooperation with the University of Akureyri. The practical training involves, among other things, learning how to deal with difficult and dangerous individuals, unarmed police tactics and arrest techniques, the use of firearms and other police equipment, first on scene help and emergency driving of police vehicles. The training also involves fieldwork where students become familiar with the day-to-day work of the police under the guidance of tutors who are also active police officers. Multiple news articles corroborate this claim, that only one person in Iceland has ever been killed by police there. The English-language Iceland Review reported in 2013 that Icelandic police had shot dead a member of the public for the first time on record, citing the Dagblai Vsir newspaper. Of that death, the Guardian wrote: Iceland Review Dagblai Vsir Guardian The 59-year-old was reported to have been shot after firing on police as they entered [a] building in the east of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik. Teargas canisters had initially been fired through the windows after the man continued shooting and two police officers are reported to have been slightly injured after they entered. The gunman was brought to hospital but was pronounced dead there at around 10am local time. The case will be investigated by Iceland's state prosecutor. The country's national police chief, Haraldur Johannessen, told a press conference in Reykjavik that the incident was \"without precedent\". We could find no record of Icelandic police having killed anyone else since 2013. Unlike the centralized national training and accreditation used in Norway, Finland, and Iceland, policing in the United States is broken up into semi-autonomous federal, state, and local forces, with training length and requirements varying across the country. However, according to data compiled by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, the average basic training for a police officer in the U.S. in 2013 was 843 hours, or around 21 weeks (based on a 40-hour work week). However, this figure encompasses only classroom instruction, with the average field training consisting of another 521 hours, or about 13 weeks. This means that, on average, the training time required to become a police officer in the United States in 2013 was 34 weeks, or just short of eight months. data The figure of \"21 weeks\" training appears to derive from the classroom instruction component, but that measurement misses field training, which increases the total training time required significantly. Furthermore, it's unclear whether these numbers have changed significantly since 2013, which is the most recent year for which the Bureau of Justice Statistics has data. The U.S. does not maintain an official national database of incidents in which police officers' actions have led to the death of civilians, so we can't know for certain the number of people killed by police between 2001 and 2018, as Vox noted in 2015: for certain noted Criminal justice experts have long known that these measures are flawed. [Bureau of Justice Statistics's Arrest-Related Deaths] collects police-caused homicide data through state reporting coordinators, but the methods of collecting data can greatly vary from state to state, often depend on differing access to technology, and sometimes don't directly involve police departments or coroner's offices. [FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports] relies on reports submitted by police agencies, but these reports are voluntary  and some states, like Florida, don't participate. \"The available data (FBI, Vital Stats, Bureau of Justice Statistics) are worse than miserable,\" David Klinger, a criminologist at the University of Missouri St. Louis, wrote in an email. \"They suck and no one should do any sort of analysis with them beyond using them to say that we have some floor [regarding] shootings and perhaps note that there are all sorts of circumstances involved when shootings occur.\" However, commendable and methodologically rigorous efforts have been undertaken to create an unofficial database, notably by the Fatal Encounters website, which has been used as a data source in academic research. research According to the Fatal Encounters database, 23,977 deaths took place at the hands of police between 2001 and 2018, which suggests that the figure of \"more than 8,000\" may be a significant underestimation. database <!--\nThis reckoning is supported by another robust source, the Guardian's database of police use of deadly force for 2015 and 2016, which tallied 1,146 and 1,093 deaths in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Those figures suggest that the meme's tally of about 450 persons killed on average per year by police  over the last 18 years is probably on the low side.\n--> database The factual claims in the meme are mostly accurate, but the underlying implication behind the meme, that shorter training programs cause the relatively high number of police killings in the United States, is questionable. Several unmentioned factors are likely to be more relevant and prominent as causes. According to a 2015 article by the sociologist and criminal justice professor Paul Hirschfield, these include: the arming of police (which is not routine in Norway and Iceland, though it is in Finland), a higher prevalence of guns among the general public (\"American police are primed to expect guns\"), decentralized and under-resourced police training (although Hirschfield does not mention the duration of training as a factor), and racial biases (whether conscious or unconscious) among law enforcement officers. article Although it's true that the United States has a vastly higher population than any of the Nordic countries mentioned in the meme, it has a much higher prevalence of police killings, even when population is taken into account. We counted the total number of police killings in each country between 2002 and 2017 (using Fatal Encounters' data for the U.S.), then adjusted for each country's average population over the course of that 16-year period. That method equated to 71 police killings per million people in the U.S., over that time period; 3.2 per million people in Iceland; 1.5 per million people in Finland, and 0.8 police killings per million people in Norway. population Norwegian Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs.  \"Annual Report 2014.\"\r\n  2015.

        "justification": "In February 2021, reports emerged that former U.S. President Donald Trump's Washington, D.C., hotel had drastically increased its room rates for March 4  the date on which some conspiracy theorists believe he is to be inaugurated for the second time and begin his second term as president. believe On Feb. 7, Business Insider published an article with the headline \"Trump's DC hotel is hiking prices for March 4, the day QAnon followers think the former president will be sworn in.\" The article stated that: Business Insider QAnon's most dedicated followers still believe that former President Donald Trump will soon be sworn in. They insist that Trump will return to power and be inaugurated in Washington, DC, on March 4. Coincidentally, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, has hiked the prices of suites around that day. Some room rates at the hotel, just blocks from the White House, have almost tripled for March 3 and 4... On Feb. 6, Forbes reported that: Forbes At the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC, the least expensive room option is the deluxe king, ranging in size from 350 to 475 square feet. At this time of year, it normally runs anywhere from $476 to $596 per night. Interestingly, on March 3 and 4, the same room is selling for $1,331 per night. Thats 180% above the base rate and more than double what youd pay any other night in February or March, according to the hotels website. Those reports contained a high degree of accuracy. Room rates at Trump's Washington, D.C., hotel were indeed remarkably high for March 3 and 4, and that sudden spike was not replicated at other five-star hotels in the nation's capital, nor at other Trump hotels. It was not possible to confirm the reason for the two-day price hike, and the ex-president's hotel company did not respond to our enquiries. We recorded the price of the most basic accommodation available at Trump's hotel between Feb. 28 and March 7, 2021, for one person for one night, and compared it with comparable accommodation at three other five-star hotels in Washington, D.C.: Sofitel; the Four Seasons; and Conrad Washington. We used each hotel's own website, and recorded the data on Feb. 8, 2021. On the six days before and after March 3 and 4, the price of a night in a \"guest room\" at Trump's hotel ranged from $476 to $636. On Wednesday, March 3 and Thursday, March 4, the same room was priced at $1,331, as Forbes correctly reported. That's an overnight increase of 139% from the $556 charged for a guest on March 2, as shown below:   On the following Wednesday and Thursday (March 10 and 11), the same room would cost $476. That massive, two-day spike was not at all a Washington-wide phenomenon. At Sofitel, the median (typical) cost of a \"superior room\" over the eight days was $249. On March 3 and 4, it was $258  just 3.8% above the median. At the Four Seasons, the typical night cost $1,020, and on March 3 and 4 it was $1,255 and $1,170, respectively  23% and 15% above average. And at Conrad Washington, the median cost of a \"deluxe room\" was $213, which was 31% and 22% below the rate on March 3 and 4, respectively. The rate of a slightly nicer room at Trump's hotel also spiked on March 3 and 4. Over the eight days in question, the median cost for a suite at the former president's hotel was $1,207. On March 3 and 4, it suddenly increased to $1,976  which is 64% higher. The March 3 and 4 price hike was also not common to all Trump's hotels  it was specific to his Washington, D.C., establishment. At Trump's New York City hotel, a night in a \"guest room\" was priced at $540 on March 3 and 4  the exact same rate as the five days surrounding those dates. In Trump's Chicago hotel, the same room cost $325 per night between Feb. 28 and March 4, rising slightly to $370 on March 5 and 6.  So the sudden, drastic two-day increase in room rates at Trump's Washington D.C. hotel was real, significant, was not part of a wider trend among five-star hotels in the city, was not a regular Wednesday and Thursday event, and was not common to all Trump hotels. It therefore defies explanation, at least so far. Snopes asked Trump hotels to explain the anomaly, and invited the company to respond to speculation that it was motivated by a desire to take advantage of a possible influx into Washington, D.C., of Trump supporters who hold to the baseless conspiracy theory that Trump will be inaugurated again on March 4. We did not receive a response. If we receive any relevant, additional information or context, we will update this fact check accordingly.",

        "justification": " Claim:  A fan tries to give away tickets to a last-place football team's game and ends up with more than he started with. LEGEND Examples:  \n[Collected via e-mail, August 2007] Here is a story that I have heard from time to time. A man has a couple tickets to a home game of a football team that is having a lousy season. (I have heard variously the Indianapolis Colts, Atlanta Falcons, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, among others, but usually it is a professional American football team.) He tries to sell them, but doesn't get a nibble. He tries giving them away, but nobody will take them. Finally, the day before the game, he goes shopping, and places the tickets on his windshield in hopes that somebody will pick them up. He remains at the store (or visits several places) for a few hours to give the tickets more exposure. When he gets back to his car, though, he discovers that, not only has nobody taken the tickets, but someone left two more!\n \n [Ducibella, 1998] A man had a ticket to a recent home game. He parked his car and walked a mile to the stadium before he realized that he had left it on the dashboard of his car. Racing back, his worst fears were realized. Someone had seen the ticket, smashed his windshield  and left four more tickets next to his.\n Origins: This legend about tickets to a woefully underperforming team's home game attracting even more tickets to that event rather than themselves being scooped up and made off with by grateful fans has been around for dogs' years. It has likely been told of every sports team to have experienced multi-year slumps because it so perfectly captures what lies deep in the hearts of many  loyal fans who have season after season shown up to support their teams only to once again be disappointed: at some point in the exercise, the desire to finally give up on the bums and stay home begins to make itself felt. This is the quintessential tale of disappointed fans finding a way to express their feelings  their teams are so bad that not only can't tickets to their games be given away, but the attempt to do so will only spark others who are equally as disappointed to fling theirs away too. The second example above is an escalation of the basic legend: in that version of the tale, an anonymous disgruntled fan actually smashes in a car window so as to gain access to the seemingly rejected item for the purpose of leaving more tickets with it. Oddly, at times this legend is manifested in non-sports versions too, as in the following example from 2011: \n\nThe drought of 1988 brought hard times to ranchers.  The lack of water meant that feed was harder to come by  and it got worse when farmers decided they'd better reserve what water they could spare for human food rather than livestock feed. The natural reaction was to sell some of their cattle  it's not good for the long run, but you have fewer cattle to feed and working capital to buy it with.  The problem is that every rancher got this idea, and soon there was a glut on the market.  It was a lovely thing for the average consumer, but as the suicide legend suggests, it wasn't quite so good for the ranchers. suicide legend One day, a clever rancher came up with a plan.  He loaded several of his calves into a trailer, then parked it on the side of the road, with the ramp to the trailer helpfully propped up next to it.  With such an easy setup, somebody was bound to steal those calves  and the insurance company would pay him what they were worth, which was considerably more than he'd get for them on the current market. When he came back to check his trailer, there were two more calves in it than when he left.\n While the \"left tickets\" story is usually told as a \"This happened to someone else\" yarn, every now and then a beleaguered fan who has for too long backed a dog will tell it as having happened to him. An Atlanta Falcons' fan regaled the audience of a call-in radio show in 1999 with his account of having once left four Falcons tickets under his car's windshield wiper and coming back to find \"eight or 12 more.\" In 1998, another caller to a talk radio show said he'd once left two St. Louis Rams tickets he didn't need under his wiper blades, and when he got back after the game, five unused tickets had been added to the pile.

Trump recently praised Sadiq Khan for winning Londons mayoral race, and said he would be willing to create an exception in his policy restricting Muslim entry into the United States in order to allow Khan to visit. But in a statement Tuesday, Khan dismissed Trumps invitation, and also denounced his views on Islam as ignorant, suggesting Trumps policies would increase the terrorist threat in both the U.S. and U.K. Daily Caller, in turn,cited yet another article as itssource, a10 May 2016 Telegraphthat also assertedthat Khan \"warned\" Trump that his proposed policies would incite violence. However, the comments attributed to Khan in that piece neither warned nor threatened Trump: asserted Donald Trump's \"ignorant\" view of Islam could make both Britain and the US less safe, new London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned. Mr Khan, who is the city's first Muslim mayor, has brushed aside the US presidential hopeful's suggestion that he would exempt him from his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States. The Republican presidential hopeful told the New York Times that he was happy to see Mr Khan elected, saying it could be \"very, very good\". However the new mayor has hit back. \"This isn't just about me - it's about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world,\" he said. Mr Khan added: \"Donald Trump's ignorant view of Islam could make both of our countries less safe - it risks alienating mainstream Muslims around the world and plays into the hands of extremists. \"Donald Trump and those around him think that Western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream Islam - London has proved him wrong.\" In his comments, Khan speculatedthat Trump's policy proposals would sow division and fuel extremism, but the comments in no way \"warned\" or \"threatened\" him. London's new mayor specifically saidthat such policies would make both the UK and the United States\"less safe,\" andthat Trump's positions mightcause relationships between \"mainstream Muslims\" (not extremists) and the West to deteriorate. No part of Khan's comments could be construed as a threat. In November 2015, Trump was embroiled in controversy after fumbling an answer to a question about whether Muslim-Americans ought to be registered or \"wear badges.\" On 7 December 2015, Trump issued an official statement via his web site \"calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on\" (archived here): wear badges statement here Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on. According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing \"25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad\" and 51% of those polled, \"agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah.\" Shariah authorizes such atrocities as murder against non-believers who won't convert, beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women. Mr. Trump stated, \"Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America Great Again.\" - Donald J.

            "A compendium of memorable April Fools' pranks."
        ],
        "justification": "We humans like a good joke, and we're not above making our nearest and dearest the butts of it, especially when the powers that be have set aside a day purely for that purpose. The first of April releases something within us that at other times during the year we attempt to keep reined in. Yet whatever social constraints we normally submit ourselves to, it is the amateur joker in us that comes to the surface every first of April, leaving us contemplating secreting ketchup in the shower head on that day or filling the sugar bowl with salt. But first-of-April pranking takes place on a larger scale too, with the media likewise giving in to its urge to kick over the traces, if only for one<!----> day. Even some corporations have heeded the siren's call. Throughout the years, those who we trust to provide us with reliable facts and honest reporting have themselves pulled an array of memorable jokes. Some have been hilarious, and some have been meanspirited, yet they've all been part of the insanity and deception of the day. Arguably the best media-generated April Fool's joke dates from a Richard Dimbleby \"news report\" aired on 1 April 1957 on BBC's Panorama. It opened with a line about Spring coming early that year, prompting an early spaghetti harvest in Switzerland. Against a video backdrop of happy peasant women harvesting spaghetti from trees, whimsical claims about the foodstuff's cultivation were made in a straightfaced manner, including the assertion that the foodstuff's oddly uniform length was the result of years of dedicated cultivation and the heartening announcement that the ravenous spaghetti weevil which had wreaked havoc with harvests of years past had been conquered. spaghetti More than 250 viewers jammed the BBC switchboard after the hoax aired, most of them calling in with serious inquiries about the piece  where could they go to watch the harvesting operation? Could they buy spaghetti plants themselves? (For those anxious to try their hand at homegrown pasta, Panorama producer Michael Peacock offered this helpful hint: \"Many British enthusiasts have had admirable results from planting a small tin of spaghetti in tomato sauce.\") One of the more imaginative April Fool's Day hoaxes was the work of a well-known restaurant chain. In 1996, Taco Bell Corp. announced it had bought the Liberty Bell from the federal government and was renaming it the Taco Liberty Bell. Citizens outraged by the vending of a historic treasure complained to the National Historic Park in Philadelphia where the bell is housed. A few hours later, Taco Bell admitted the spoof.\nWhen asked about the sale, Mike McCurry (who was then the White House press secretary) replied with tongue in cheek that the Lincoln Memorial had also been sold to a different corporation and would henceforth be known as the Ford Lincoln Mercury Memorial. Another fast food restaurant served up its own April Fool's prank, this one in 1998. That year Burger King announced via full-page ads a new item added to its menu: \"Left-Handed Whoppers.\" Designed for the thousands of southpaw Americans inconvenienced by the standard Whopper, this re-engineered sandwich contained all the ingredients of the original but with them rotated a full 180 degrees to redistribute their weight so toppings would no longer squish out from the right side of the bun. On April 1 1998, according to the company, thousands requested the new sandwich. Others were moved to ask if a right-handed version was also available. Pranks involving food are legion. In 1994 sweets lovers in Britain were enthralled by ads touting the biggest ever Mars Bar: The Emperor. This behemoth of candyland contained \"32 lbs of thick chocolate, glucose and milk\" and was on sale for only one day  April 1. (Which was a good thing; it would have taken all year to eat it.) The more health-conscious had a carrot prank set for them. 2002 saw the British supermarket chain Tesco advertising the successful development of a \"whistling carrot.\" Said vegetable, the product of genetic modification, had airholes in it that would cause it to whistle to signal its being boiled to perfection, in the same way that a kettle toots when the water therein reaches full boil. In 1979 London's Capital Radio announced that thanks to British Summertime, 48 hours had been gained by the calendar. To make things come out right, two days needed to be cancelled: April 5 and April 12. Said announcement caused panic among folks with birthdays and anniversaries on those days. The respected magazine PC Computing was overcome by an attack of pranking fever in 1994 when it published an article describing a bill before the U.S. Congress. SB 040194 would make it a crime to use the Internet while intoxicated or to discuss sexual matters online. Blaming the term 'Information Superhighway' for the legislators' zeal on this issue, the article's author explained \"Congress apparently thinks being drunk on a highway is bad no matter what kind of highway it is.\" In 1977 a British newspaper published a seven-page supplement extolling the 10th anniversary of San Seriffe, a small republic in the Indian Ocean consisting of several semi-colon-shaped islands. Its two main islands were Upper Caisse and Lower Caisse, its capital Bodoni, and its leader General Pica. Readers intrigued by the purported charm of this little-known holiday spot were disappointed to learn the islands did not exist and the references to them were drawn from printer's terminology. In 1976 British astronomer Patrick Moore told listeners the movement of two planets would result in an upward gravitational pull that would make people lighter at precisely 9:47 a.m. that day. He invited his audience to jump in the air and experience \"a strange floating sensation.\" Within minutes, dozens of listeners had phoned in to say the experiment had worked! Australia appears to have embraced the custom of April Fool's pranks perpetrated by the media. In 2003 newspapers in that country touted a breakthrough advertised by car-maker Mini that promised an end to parking hassles with its \"vertical parking locator\" and flagged the development of vertical parking lots on the sides of buildings. Not to be outdone, another paper's Good Living supplement featured a review of Species restaurant, where diners could feast on culinary delights crafted from animals featured on the World Wildlife Fund's endangered list. The restaurant, owned by April Phewell, specialised in braised slices of hairy nosed wombat, yellow spotted tree frog kebabs and Sumatran Rhino steaks, the newspaper said. Another paper reported on a plan to hack down some of the Sydney suburb's Norfolk Island Pines to make way for mobile phone towers in the shape of, you guessed it, Norfolk Island Pines. Two of the major dailies carried an advertisement that claimed motorists would be able to avoid road tolls through use of new technology that would render their vehicles invisible. In 2000 respected source for financial information The Motley Fool announced its discovery of Shakespeare's $18.7 billion investment portfolio. An exhumation of the bard had unearthed his stock holdings, which apparently had been buried with him. Old Will certainly knew how to pick them: his investment in Horse, Inc., for instance, was converted into shares of The Ford Motor Company. Also in 2000 the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals organization (PETA) convinced many its members planned to slip tranquilizers into Lake Palestine prior to the Red Man Cowboy Division Fishing Tournament. The fish would doze while fishermen grew red, PETA said. Park rangers were dispatched to patrol the area to prevent animal lovers from doping the water to protect the fishes, yet the math of it should have ruled this one a joke  to drug the 25,500-acre reservoir containing 40 billion gallons of water would have taken enough Sominex to fill three Exxon Valdezes. In 1986 disc jockeys in Providence, Rhode Island announced the city was shutting down for the day. The \"Providence Labor Action Relations Board Committee\" was blamed for the decision with the radio station advising listeners to go home. Those seeking further information about the closure were directed to the telephone number of the station's cross-town rival. That unsuspecting victim received hundreds of calls from folks wanting to know what was going on, and the police in that city were, according to one dispatcher, likewise \"swamped\" by folks calling in. Yet not all jokes are of the pleasant or humorous sort. In 2000 families of men being held in a Romanian prison were duped into travelling hundreds of miles to the facility to await the release of their loved ones, an event that had been announced in the newspaper as a joke on April 1. In 1987 three Massachusetts teens who sprayed a teacher in the face with silver nitrate were sentenced to fifteen days in jail and two years of probation. The caustic solution caused burns to the face, neck and arms of Virginia Guistina and left her skin temporarily discolored. That same year (but thankfully in a far lighter vein), residents of a town in Illinois were advised to all flush their toilets at a predetermined time to force a 10-foot alligator from the town's sewer. Also in 1987 residents of another town in Illinois were worried about a new \"sin\" tax their city was instituting. According to the plan, townspeople would have to call a special number once every two months to be taken through a questionnaire by a city employee who would first hook up the phone to a device that determined whether callers were answering truthfully. Answers that indicated residents had been engaging in various forms of sin would prompt the levying of a bi-monthly tax against them, the amount depending on what they'd been up to and how often. In another 1987 April Fool's joke, a newspaper in Tennessee ran a story about chic, waterproof attire from European clothing designers, who call their creations \"Le Sac Pourri,\" otherwise known as plastic garbage bags. \"The plastic garments come in boxes of 10 and are inexpensively priced at $1.35, but viewers were warned that unless accessorized by expensive jewelry costing hundreds of dollars, the look will lose its impact,\" it said. And some pranks provoke outrage. In 1999 a bank in Connecticut angered its customers through a prank it ran in the local paper as an announcement of a new fee. According to the ad, those of its patrons wishing to speak with one of its tellers would be charged $5 a visit. Though many got the joke (it was meant as a jab at the financial institutions that actually follow this practice), some didn't, resulting in customers threatening to close all their accounts. The bank ran the ad the next day, that time clearly marked as a joke. Other jokes are pulled by those who we would hope would know better. In 1989 two police officers in Utah were suspended without pay for a couple of days for their April Fools' Day prank of placing invisible dye (used by police to catch criminals and normally put on money) in restrooms in the city-county building and the mayor's office. The colorless powder dye turns a dark purple when it comes into contact with skin  it's harmless but takes a while to wear off, as the mayor found out when it turned him into a \"marked man.\" Each 1st of April brings with it more opportunities for merriment, which means the books will never be closed on this topic.

        "justification": " Claim:  The U.S. dollar will officially collapse after 1 July 2014 due to the implementation of H.R. 2847. Examples:  [Collected via e-mail, April 2014] On this date, U.S. House of Representatives Bill \"H.R. 2847\" goes into effect. It will usher in the true collapse of the U.S. dollar, and will make millions of Americans poorer, overnight. You now have just several months to prepare ... Origins:  This item about the passage of H.R. 2847 causing the U.S. dollar to collapse as of 1 July 2014 is another example financial scarelore put out in conjunction with an investment come-on, in this case an ominous sales pitch put out by the folks at Stansberry & Associates Investment Research LLC. come-on This latest panic piece is offered in a Stansberry & Associates presentation featuring a number of scary-sounding statements about how we in the U.S. are soon to experience a \"near-complete shutdown of the American economy,\" will see \"the savings of millions wiped out,\" will be living under the imposition of martial law by the federal government, and will be struggling in the aftermath of a number of other apocalyptic financial scenarios. presentation And according to Stansberry & Associates, this remarkable, radical collapse of the United States monetary system and \"our normal way of life\" is going into effect in a mere matter of months (just like a similar recent conspiracy scare about the federal government's plan to eliminate 16 states from the U.S. in the very near future). 16 states But wait ... all one needs in order to avoid suffering from this devastating national calamity, one that will collapse our entire monetary system and spell doom for the American way of life, is a little information. Information that can be yours if you'll just shell out $149 for a one-year subscription to Stansberry's Investment Advisory newsletter. Or, as one wry commentator put it: subscription In other words, if a financial company spews a bunch of stuff that sounds sufficiently alarming, and then promotes its product as something that will help protect people against this horribly scary thing, it might be able to lure gullible folks into believing that a \"fairly easy and inexpensive to protect themselves\" against losing their money is for them to send their money to that company instead. And, unfortunately, such schemes work often enough to keep these types of schemers in business. So what is this all really about? H.R. 2847, also known as the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (or HIRE), was a Congressional bill passed into law in March 2010 that sought to provide payroll tax breaks and incentives for businesses to hire unemployed workers. A section of that bill, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (known as FATCA), sought to eliminate the non-compliance of U.S. taxpayers who hold foreign accounts by requiring those taxpayers (including those living outside the U.S.) to report certain foreign accounts and offshore assets to the government, and by requiring foreign financial institutions to report information about the ownership of overseas assets held by U.S. taxpayers to the government: HIRE FATCA   The problem originates in U.S. government efforts to prevent future offshore-banking tax scams like the UBS one in 2009. To keep better track of the flow of assets owned by U.S. citizens, Fatca requires bankers in other countries to send the IRS information about transactions by any of their customers who are Americans. Similarly, U.S. banks have to report to the IRS info on their non-U.S.-citizen customers, so the IRS can send it on to their home countries.   You can understand the motivation behind the rule. It's a big connected world economy, huge sums can be transferred anywhere in an instant, and much as INTERPOL or the World Health Organization have a legitimate interest in sharing data, so too might taxing authorities. In principle, everyone should pay his or her fair share, somewhere. As noted on the American Citizens Abroad web site: American Citizens Abroad   Starting July 1, 2014, FATCA will require FFIs to provide annual reports to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the name and address of each U.S. client, as well as the largest account balance in the year and total debits and credits of any account owned by a U.S. person.   If an institution does not comply, the U.S. will impose a 30% withholding tax on all its transactions concerning U.S. securities, including the proceeds of sale of securities.   In addition, FATCA requires any foreign company not listed on a stock exchange or any foreign partnership which has 10% U.S. ownership to report to the IRS the names and tax I.D. number (TIN) of any U.S. owner.   FATCA also requires U.S. citizens and green card holders who have foreign financial assets in excess of $50,000 (higher for those who are bona-fide residents abroad) to complete a new Form 8938 to be filed with the 1040 tax return, starting with fiscal year 2011. FATCA has been the subject of criticisms on a number of fronts (which the Treasury Department has attempted to counter in its own \"Myth vs. FACTA\" write-up), among them that the costs of implementing it may outstrip the additional revenues it will bring in, that it may prompt \"capital flight\" in the form of foreign financial institutions divesting themselves of U.S. assets, that foreign relations may be strained by the U.S. requiring foreign governments to gather and report (at their own expense) information on U.S. citizens, and that the law may make it difficult or impossible for U.S. citizens living and/or working abroad to open accounts in foreign banks: criticisms Myth vs. FACTA   But casting such a wide net is producing unintended consequences for some Americans who faithfully pay their taxes from afar.   Banks around the world are suddenly rejecting Americans as clients or customers, because they don't want the reporting and bureaucratic hassles, plus the potential exposure to draconian penalties. Non-Americans are pulling their assets out of U.S. banks. I get emails every day from American expats who say they are facing all kinds of problems bringing their long-standing foreign-based banking life into compliance with this new law. Some of them say they're getting ready to renounce their citizenship. Over the years I've had accounts with banks in England, Japan, Malaysia, China, and now Australia when living or working in those places, and I'm wondering what I have to worry about to make sure the remaining ones \"comply.\"   \"I have always filed my U.S. taxes just as I am supposed to,\" says Brian Dublin, 47, an American businessman now based in Zug, Switzerland, who has lived overseas for many years, including stints in Russia.   \"However, as a result of FATCA, in the past year I have been kicked out of a Swiss bank that said, 'Hey, we love you, but we won't work with Americans.' I have also been kicked out of a Swiss pension fund. They told me they don't want any Americans in the fund. They don't want to work on behalf of the IRS,\" he says.   \"And on top of that, I spend many hours and many dollars each year filing U.S. taxes when I sometimes turn out to have zero liability for that year because I have paid a lot of tax somewhere else,\" Dublin adds.   Dublin, a New York City native, says he will be eligible for Swiss nationality in the next few years and that if the situation has not dramatically changed he will give serious consideration to renouncing his U.S. citizenship. Writing in the New American, Alex Newman argued the more dire side of FATCA, speculating that it could potentially result in a large-scale movement by foreign investors to pull out of U.S. assets and markets:   Estimates suggest there is currently more than $21 trillion of foreign capital invested in American assets and markets, with about $10 trillion of that in the stock market. However, that could change as FATCA enforcement begins later this year  possibly quickly. The Japanese Bankers Association, the European Banking Federation, the Institute of International Bankers, and others, for example, have all openly warned in recent years that some of their members could decide to ditch U.S. assets and markets in response to FATCA.   Luxembourg Bankers' Association CEO Jean-Jacques Rommes, speaking to Democrats Abroad, warned that the best way for banks to lower compliance risks was simply to reduce the amount of American assets they hold. \"In other words, divest from the US market, in general,\" he explained, as summarized by the Luxembourg Bankers' Association.   Multiple reports have suggested that small and medium-sized firms, unable to bear the compliance costs or the crippling withholding taxes, would be especially likely to ditch American markets. \"On the institutional side, the cost of becoming FATCA compliant may be prohibitive for some foreign institutions, and therefore they will divest from their American holdings,\" explained Douglas Goldstein, author of The Expatriate's Guide to Handling Money and Taxes and director of Profile Investment Services Ltd. Indeed, compliance costs borne by the private sector are expected to dwarf the amount of additional U.S. tax revenue  perhaps by hundreds of times.   Goldstein explained: \"Faced with the choice between paying to implement the new rules or divesting from U.S.-based assets, smaller foreign banks that can't afford to shoulder these costs may choose the latter,\" Goldstein added. \"After all, there are plenty of promising new markets in which to invest.\"   Needless to say, if foreign institutions started fleeing U.S. markets, the economic damage would be massive  potentially apocalyptic, especially considering U.S. trade deficits and Americas outsized reliance on foreign investment and outside credit just to function. The full implementation of FATCA may, as some critics have maintained, ultimately prove more harmful to U.S. business interests and U.S. citizens living and working abroad than its benefits will merit. But no credible source that isn't an investment firm trying to scare potential customers into forking over money for a newsletter subscription is seriously maintaining that a law passed five years ago will collapse the entire U.S. economic system, destroy the American way of life, and lead to the imposition of martial law.

        ],
        "justification": "In December 2021, members of a white nationalist group known as Patriot Front marched at the Lincoln Memorial and other parts of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., wearing face coverings and an improvised uniform of khaki pants and dark blue jackets, and carrying shields and American flags. Images and videos from the rally were widely shared online, and the event attracted a measure of national news coverage.  national news coverage  However, several figures from the American right sought to undermine the authenticity of the rally, claiming variously that it was conducted by federal law enforcement agents in disguise, and/or left-wing agents provocateurs, or actors. For example, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., described the men shown in one video as \"movie characters\": described \"No Patriot group Ive ever seen wears khakis, Stormtrooper knee pads, and covers their faces like theyre scared. Just more movie characters.\"   For his part, right-wing commentator Dinesh D'Souza speculated that the event was \"fake,\" and conducted by \"FBI agents,\" and asked \"Where are the media interviews so we can see and hear directly from this group?\" speculated On Telegram, far-right conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl claimed \"these are feds,\" on the basis that the men shown in videos appeared to be unusually slim, and Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers, a prominent supporter of disproven election fraud conspiracy theories, described Patriot Front as a \"fake group\" composed of \"feds.\" conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl claimed supporter described On Gateway Pundit, right-wing conspiracy theorist Jim Hoft described the event as \"feds on parade,\" while on the right-wing website 100 Percent Fed Up, Patty McMurray falsely described Patriot Front as \"a group no one has ever heard of.\" described described While McMurray and others may not have been aware of Patriot Front's existence before December 2021, it is indeed a real, earnestly-motivated white nationalist group with a real, readily verifiable history. Its leader, a 23-year-old Texan named Thomas Ryan Rousseau, is a known far-right and fascist activist in the United States, and he was clearly visible and identifiable at the Dec. 4 National Mall rally. Claims that the event was faked or staged, by federal agents or actors, are entirely lacking in evidence, and are contradicted by the best available evidence. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \"False.\" The origins of the group can be traced back to the aftermath of the infamous \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August, 2017. The far-right and white supremacist demonstration descended into chaos and violence, culminating in an incident in which neo-Nazi sympathizer James Fields ploughed a car into a crowd of anti-fascist and anti-racist counterprotesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring several others.  Rousseau, then 18 years old, led a contingent from the neo-Nazi group Vanguard America, using the high-profile Charlottesville rally as an opportunity to strengthen his claim on the organization, amid a leadership struggle that summer. Fields dressed in a Vanguard uniform, but was reportedly not a recognized member of the group. In a still image posted online by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Fields can be seen standing close to Rousseau in Charlottesville.  leadership struggle reportedly posted online Patriot Front, then, was originally a splinter group from Vanguard America, led by Rousseau  a native of the Dallas-Forth Worth suburb of Grapevine  and started in late 2017. Far from being an \"unknown\" entity that suspiciously materialized out of nowhere in December 2021, both Patriot Front and Rousseau have been the subject of monitoring and news coverage since that time. The Anti-Defamation League, for example, has kept a public file on the group for at least 3 1/2 years.  news coverage since public file In May 2017 emails obtained by the Texas Observer, and seen by Snopes, an FBI special agent warned college administrators in North Texas that a \"Thomas Ryan Rousseau\" was one of four individuals believed to be responsible for posting white supremacist flyers on local campuses. At the time, Rousseau was still attending Coppell High School, and writing nationalist, pro-Trump columns for the student newspaper.  Texas Observer columns Rousseau has been arrested or cited by police on at least two occasions, for misdemeanors relating to defacing property with white nationalist propaganda.  two occasions He has described himself as a fascist, but Patriot Front's manifesto does not include any such keywords, instead placing an emphasis on American nationalism and a return to traditional values.  has described himself as a fascist According to in-depth research by ProPublica, this is part of a careful strategy, personally overseen by Rousseau, to soften Patriot Front's image, keeping its white supremacist, racist, anti-Semitic and violent tendencies out of sight when conducting public outreach or holding events such as the Dec. 4 rally at the National Mall.  in-depth research by ProPublica No doubt exists that Rousseau was present at the Dec. 4 Patriot Front rally in Washington, D.C., and that he led the participants in chanting various slogans, before making a speech outside the U.S. Capitol. Ample video evidence, posted to Telegram by Patriot Front itself, as well as a white nationalist propaganda platform called Media2Rise, demonstrates definitively that Rousseau led the rally.  For example, in one clip, white nationalist propagandist Lucca Corgiat, who was embedded with Patriot Front throughout Dec. 4, introduces Rousseau by his first name, asking him to explain why the group is demonstrating in the nation's capital:  Rousseau stood out from other participants in not wearing a face covering, and was therefore readily identifiable throughout the rally, as a still image from another Media2Rise video, and the following Patriot Front screenshot, both illustrate: still image   Getty photographer Win McNamee also took pictures of Rousseau at the Dec. 4 rally, including the following one: the following one  Patriot Front founder Thomas Rousseau waits along the George Washington Parkway near Arlington Cemetery after the group marched on the National Mall on December 04, 2021 in Arlington, Virginia. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)  For reference, the following is a still image of Rousseau taken from an August 2021 video posted to Telegram by Patriot Front:   It is a demonstrable fact that Rousseau attended the Dec. 4 Patriot Front rally in Washington, D.C., in his capacity as leader of that organization  a white nationalist, far-right group. Rousseau and Patriot Front have been the subject of considerable social media self-promotion, as well as investigative news coverage, for nearly five years.  Furthermore, those claiming that the Dec. 4 rally was a \"false flag\" event perpetrated by left-wing agents provocateurs or federal agents, have presented no credible evidence to that effect. Snopes invited Taylor Greene to provide any evidence that would support her claims about the authenticity of the rally. A spokesperson for the Congresswoman asked us, in turn, \"What proof do you have to the contrary?\" In response, Snopes outlined that proof for the spokesperson, and repeated our request for evidence from Taylor Greene. We did not receive any further responses.  Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers did not respond to a similar request for evidence from Snopes.    19-Year-Old White Supremacist Cited for Hate-Speech Fliers Posted in Fort Worth.

        "justification": "Claim:  E-mail reproduces a 1999 newspaper article warning about potential troubles with Fannie Mae. Status:  True. Example:  [Collected via e-mail, September 2008] \n\n\nRight out of the pages of the NY Times!!!\nAnd look at the date..!!!\n \n September 30, 1999\nFannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending  In a move that could help increase home ownership rates among minorities and low-income consumers, the Fannie Mae Corporation is easing the credit requirements on loans that it will purchase from banks and other lenders. The action, which will begin as a pilot program involving 24 banks in 15 markets  including the New York metropolitan region  will encourage those banks to extend home mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough to qualify for conventional loans. Fannie Mae officials say they hope to make it a nationwide program by next spring.  [Rest of article here.]\n here Origins:  In any crisis, one of the most common reactions is to ponder the question, \"How did we get into this mess?\"  People begin to search for explanations about who was responsible for bringing about the current state of  affairs, who had the ability to head it off (but failed to act or was thwarted), and who foresaw the looming danger (but declined to speak up or was ignored).  With the United States currently in the throes of an economic crisis, of which one symptom was the September 2008 government takeover of the foundering Federal National Mortgage Association (commonly known as Fannie Mae), a nine-year-old warning about the home mortgage underwriter's being vulnerable to economic problems that could require government rescue was bound to pique public interest. On 30 September 1999, the New York Times published an article entitled \"Fannie Mae Eases Credit to Aid Mortgage Lending\" by Steven A. Holmes.  The complete text of the article is available online, but in a nutshell the Times reported that Fannie Mae was easing its credit requirements for home mortgage loans in response to increasing pressure from a variety of groups: text \n Clinton administration officials who wanted Fannie Mae \"to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people\" (particularly minority groups).  Stockholders who wanted Fannie Mae \"to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\"  Banks, thrift institutions and mortgage companies (from whom Fannie Mae purchases loans) who wanted the company to facilitate  \"more loans to subprime borrowers.\"\n In light of recent events, what caught the attention of most readers was a couple of paragraphs in the middle of the article cautioning about the possible consequences of Fannie Mae's loosening its credit requirements: \n\nIn moving, even tentatively, into this new area of lending, Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times. But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980's.  \"From the perspective of many people, including me, this is another thrift industry growing up around us,\" said Peter Wallison a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \"If they fail, the government will have to step up and bail them out the way it stepped up and bailed out the thrift industry.\"\n Another New York Times article that has attained a significant amount retrospective interest is an 11 September 2003 article entitled \"New Agency Proposed to Oversee Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae\" by Stephen Labaton, which reported on the efforts of the Bush administration to create a new regulatory agency to assume oversight of those mortgage lenders: article \n\nThe Bush administration today recommended the most significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance industry since the savings and loan crisis a decade ago. Under the plan, disclosed at a Congressional hearing today, a new agency would be created within the Treasury Department to assume supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored companies that are the two largest players in the mortgage lending industry. The new agency would have the authority, which now rests with Congress, to set one of the two capital-reserve requirements for the companies. It would exercise authority over any new lines of business. And it would determine whether the two are adequately managing the risks of their ballooning portfolios. The plan is an acknowledgment by the administration that oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  which together have issued more than $1.5 trillion in outstanding debt  is broken. A report by outside investigators in July concluded that Freddie Mac manipulated its accounting to mislead investors, and critics have said Fannie Mae does not adequately hedge against rising interest rates.\n Of especial interest to current readers were the following paragraphs about Congressional resistance to the Bush administration's regulatory proposal: \n\nSignificant details must still be worked out before Congress can approve a bill. Among the groups denouncing the proposal today were the National Association of Home Builders and Congressional Democrats who fear that tighter regulation of the companies could sharply reduce their commitment to financing low-income and affordable housing. \"These two entities  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  are not facing any kind of financial crisis,\" said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee. \"The more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing.\"\n\n Last updated:  2 October 2008\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   Holmes, Steven A.  \"Fannie Mae Eases Credit to Aid Mortgage Lending.\"\n   The New York Times.  30 September 1999.

            "Has a man has been living at a Paris airport since 1988?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Between 1988 and 2006, a man lived at a Paris airport. \nStatus:  True.\n Origins:  What follows is one representative newspaper account of the strange story of  Mehran Karimi Nasseri, a man without country, trapped by his lack of papers in Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, since 26 August 1988: \n\nHe could be any passenger waiting for a flight, sitting patiently on a red plastic bench in Charles de Gaulle Airport's Terminal One, luggage piled neatly by his side.  He sips a cup of hot chocolate and scans the crowd, occasionally cocking his head to listen to the airport announcements. He peruses a book, Hillary Rodham Clinton's \"It Takes a Village.\"  But Mehran Karimi Nasseri is going nowhere. He has been waiting for a flight out of France, he says, for 10 years.  Nasseri was expelled from Iran a decade ago for his political views. Through a series of fateful missteps, he landed here without any documents. Since then, Europe's increasingly stiff stance toward refugees and his fragile mental state have kept him at the airport here in legal limbo.  His is a story of broken hopes and bureaucracy, of a trip across Europe in search of a homeland that became a journey into mental chaos and despair. And it is a story of a man who has searched for his family, only to find an adopted one here, at Charles de Gaulle.  \"He's like a part of the airport. Everyone knows him,\" says Muhamed Mourrid, the manager of the Bye Bye Bar, pointing to the spot where Nasseri, 47, has lived for a decade. \"That's his table, his chair, his place.\" Adds Marise Petry, a Lufthansa clerk, \"He's one of us. We even get letters for him.\"  Among the annals of horrific refugee tales, Nasseri's story is remarkable for its pathos and complexity. It begins in Iran in 1977, when Nasseri, fresh from studying in England, was expelled for protesting against the shah. His expulsion left him without a passport.  Nasseri came to Europe. He bounced from capital to capital, applying for refugee status and being refused, again and again, for nearly four years. In 1981, his request for political asylum from Iran was finally granted by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Belgium.  That decision gave him refugee credentials, which in turn allowed him to seek citizenship in a European country. The son of an Iranian and a Briton, Nasseri decided in 1986 on England with the hope of finding relatives there.  He got as far as Paris, where in 1988 his briefcase containing his refugee documents was stolen in a train station.  Nasseri boarded a plane for London anyway. But when officials at Heathrow Airport found he had no passport, they sent him back to Charles de Gaulle. At first, the French police arrested him for illegal entry. But as Nasseri had no documents, there was no country of origin to which he could be deported.  So he took up residence in Terminal One. From its circular confines, he and his attorney, the Paris-based human rights lawyer Christian Bourget, battled to define his status and send him to London. In 1992, a French court finally ruled that Nasseri had entered the airport legally as a refugee and could not be expelled from it.  But the court could not force the French government to allow him out of the airport onto French soil. In fact, Bourget said, French authorities refused to give Nasseri either a refugee or transit visa. \"It was pure bureaucracy,\" said the lawyer. French immigration authorities have no comment on the case.  Bourget and Nasseri then focused on Belgium, where they hoped to reclaim Nasseri's original refugee documents. But Belgian refugee officials refused to mail them to him in France. They argued that Nasseri had to present himself in person so that they could be sure he was the same man to whom they had granted political asylum years before.  But, inexplicably, the Belgian government refused at that point to allow Nasseri to return there. And under Belgian law, a refugee who voluntarily leaves a country that has accepted him cannot return.  In 1995, the Belgian government finally told Nasseri that he could retrieve his refugee documents if he agreed to live in Belgium under the supervision of a social worker. Nasseri refused. He said he would move only to Great Britain.  And so here he has remained, year after year. At first glance, the dignified man does not appear to be a refugee who sleeps on an airport bench because he has nowhere else to go. His clothes are clean, his moustache well-trimmed. He keeps his one blazer covered with plastic wrap, hanging from an airport cart. His belongings are carefully packed in a frayed suitcase and a stack of Lufthansa boxes.  Nasseri nods hello to a clerk, who calls him \"Alfred,\" his nickname here. He follows the news closely, thanks to the most recent Time magazine, which the postman has just dropped off. And he loves to discuss the new selections from the Book-of-the-Month Club. \"I just keep on reading, every day,\" said the soft-spoken Nasseri, a courtly gentleman who rises and offers his seat to a visitor. \"I just keep waiting here.\"  His pallid complexion is testament to his inability to cross the airport threshold to the outside world. He walks to the doors of Terminal One and absorbs fresh air as they swing open. But he never steps outside. His hollow cheeks and thin frame show the limits of the generosity of airport staff and strangers to help with his meals.  Nasseri's confused account of his plight speaks to the psychological price he has paid in his fight to become a man who belongs somewhere. \"Nobody could suffer all he did and stay normal,\" noted Bourget.  The sad truth is this: After fighting for years to leave the airport and apply for citizenship elsewhere, Nasseri was afraid to do so when the opportunity arose. Belgium offered Nasseri the chance to settle there, but he refused. \"Now, I think he will stay in the airport until he dies,\" Bourget concluded softly.  His bizarre tale has brought him a degree of fame. He has been the subject of news reports from Finland to Britain. His life story became a 1994 French film, starring Jean Rochefort.  Nasseri gets fewer visitors now to punctuate the long days down on Terminal One's boutique level, ringed with stores and small cafes. But he still has a following who help clothe and feed him and lift his spirits. \"He does no harm to anyone,\" said Papa Starr, manager of the Les Palmes restaurant. \"Everyone cares for him here.\"  Several times a week, the airport priest stops by to visit him, as does Dr. Phillipe Bargain, the airport doctor. Many staff regularly visit him at his table for a cup of coffee and a chat. \"I get lots of cards at Christmas,\" he said. \"I call it my American Christmas.\"  His life follows the quotidian airport cycle. He wakes at 5:30 in order to shave in the men's room before passengers arrive. He reads all day long. At night, he waits until the airport stores are locked before he brushes his teeth with the toothbrush and toothpaste from a complimentary airline travel kit. Weekly, he rinses out his clothes overnight in the bathroom.  Nasseri is renowned throughout the airport for his refusal to ask for help. \"We have a colleague who gave him clothes, but he returned them, saying 'I'm not a beggar,'\" said Crystelle L'Hospitalier, a Lufthansa clerk. But he has to eat, and accepts occasional meal vouchers and francs from stewardesses and airport staff.  As the years have slipped by, it has become increasingly clear that Nasseri will never leave Charles de Gaulle. His airport years have made him \"crazier by the day,\" on the topic of his future, said airport doctor Bargain. When he talks about flying to London, the staff here greet him with understanding smiles.  \"An airport is kind of a place between heaven and earth,\" said Danielle Yzerman, spokeswoman for Charles de Gaulle. \"He has found a home here.\"1\n Nasseri, who has since adopted the name \"Sir, Alfred Mehran\" (that's not a typo  Nasseri took both the title and its misplaced comma from a mistake in a letter from British immigration), has changed the story he tells about his background several times over the years: \n\nOver the years, he has claimed many things about his origins. At one time his mother was Swedish, another time English. Nasseri's effectively reinvented himself in the Charles de Gaulle airport and denies these days that he's Iranian, deflecting any conversation about his childhood in Tehran. (\"He pretends he doesn't speak Persian,\" his longtime lawyer, Christian Bourguet, says. \"He was interviewed by Iranian journalists and made believe he didn't understand.\") When we first met two years ago, he insisted that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was attempting to locate his parents in order to establish his identity. But a spokeswoman for the agency dismissed the assertion as \"pure folly.\"  Early on in his saga, Nasseri maintained that he was expelled from his homeland for antigovernment activity in 1977. According to a number of reports, Nasseri protested against the regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi while a student in England, and when he returned to Iran, found himself imprisoned, and shortly thereafter exiled. He bounced around Europe for a few years with temporary refugee papers, alighting finally in Belgium, where he was awarded official refugee status in 1981. He traveled to Britain and France without difficulty until 1988, when he landed at Charles de Gaulle airport after being denied entry into Britain, because, he contends, his passport and refugee certificate were stolen in a mugging on a Paris subway. Nasseri could not prove who he was, nor offer proof of his refugee status. So he moved into the Zone d'attente, a holding area for travelers without papers. He stayed for days, then weeks  then months, then years. As his bizarre odyssey stretched on, Bourguet, the noted French human rights lawyer, took on the case, and the news media piled on. Articles appeared around the world, and Nasseri became the subject of three documentary films. (Oddly, apparently none of his friends or relatives have attempted to contact him.)2\n Nasseri  is known for his honesty (when he isn't talking about himself) and his refusal of charity. On two occasions he turned in billfolds full of money that had been mislaid by passengers. Airline and airport personnel push meal vouchers on him so he can eat. \"French fries are my favorite,\" he confides. \"It's not a very healthy diet, but I get enough.\"  On 17 September 1999, an international travel card and a French residency permit were put into Nasseri's hands. With them, he's now free to leave the airport, either to take up residency in France or to fly to another country that will allow him entry. He refuses to sign them, however, because they list his nationality as Iranian, and he wants it listed as British. He remains at Charles de Gaulle airport, using the excuse that he's determined to stick to this point rather than face life outside the terminal: \n\n[In 1999] he finally got permission to leave the airport  in fact, he can now go wherever he likes in Europe. The problem is, he no longer wants to. \"He is scared to leave this bubble world he has been living in,\" said Dr. Philippe Bargain, the airport's medical director. \"Finally getting the papers has been a huge shock to him, as if he was just thrown from his horse. When you wait 11 years for something and suddenly in a few minutes you sign some papers and it's done  imagine what a shock that is.\" \"He will have to be weaned from the airport, like an addict really.\" Dr. Bargain said. \"Still, it does make you wonder what kind of a society we live in that this can happen to a man.\"3\n In July 2006, Nasseri was hospitalized.

Some, for example, used this list to cast doubt on vaccine mandates. Others claimed that this was \"proof\" that the COVID-19 pandemic was manmade. The problem with these claims, of course, is that this document does not list 70 members of \"Pfizer's Investment Board\" who are also members of the Chinese Communist Party.   First off, it isn't exactly clear what this rumor is referring to as Pfizer's \"investment board.\" The company's website has a page for investors, and that page lists several boards and committees - there's an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Governance & Sustainability Committee, Executive Committee, Regulatory and Compliance Committee, Science and Technology Committee - but no \"investment committee.\" It's also worth mentioning that the aforementioned committees are all comprised of a handful of people, not the 100+ implied by the above-displayed meme. The company's website has a page for investors Pfizer Ventures (PV), the venture capital arm of Pfizer Inc., is led by a small team, none of whom are mentioned on this list.  Pfizer Ventures   Lastly, this rumor may be referring to Pfizer Investments Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Pfizer that operates out of China. However, a spokesperson for Pfizer told us that \"none of the names listed ... are affiliated with our subsidiary Pfizer Investments Co., Ltd.\" subsidiary of Pfizer that operates out of China If these names don't come from Pfizer's \"investment board,\" where do they come from? In December 2020, the Daily Mail and other outlets reported that a \"leaked database of 1.95 million registered (CCP) party members\" revealed that many British, Australian and American companies had employed people tied to the Chinese government. This database, which was originally leaked on Telegram, reportedly dates back to 2016. It doesn't appear that any government agency has verified the authenticity of this database and while this leak may have raised suspicions of corporate espionage -- a genuine threat that the Federal Bureau of Investigations is monitoring -- some news reports about it noted \"there is no evidence that anyone on the party membership list has spied for China.\" Daily Mail Federal Bureau of Investigations is monitoring Shortly after this \"leak\" made the news, the list purporting to show \"70 members of the Pfizer investment board\" who were also \"members of the Chinese Communist Party\" started circulating on conspiratorial internet forums such as godlikeproductions. At the time, this list was simply being shared as if it showed \"CCP members list (from the) leaked file. godlikeproductions We have not been able to connect the names on this viral list to the leak supposedly showing 1.95 million CCP members (that database is not publicly available), and cannot say if any of the people on this list are truly connected to the CCP. As noted above, this leaked database reportedly comes from 2016 and may not even represent a person's current political affiliations.  We searched for all 70 names on this viral list, and found that a few of those listed truly worked for Pfizer in some capacity (researchers, programmers, directors, etc...) In many cases, the names weren't properly rendered (the list mentions a \"Cai Bingbing\" that likely refers to a Bing Cai) and in some cases it appears the names were made up out of whole cloth. For example, we were not able to find any matches for \"Chen Thirsty,\" \"High Also,\" \"Jia Four Flowers,\" \"Jody,\" \"Strictly\" or \"Mosha.\" One name, too, appeared to refer to a politician, not a Pfizer employee. \"Kevin Rudd\" is a former Prime Minister of Australia, who claimed that he lobbied Pfizer to expedite their vaccine rollout. We also found a few names on this list that referred to former Pfizer employees, not current ones.  lobbied Pfizer to expedite their vaccine rollout. No. This list first appeared in December 2020 after an alleged database containing 1.95 million names of members of the Chinese Communist Party was leaked online. While that leaked database reportedly showed the political affiliations of nearly 2 million people as of 2016, it does not show current CCP membership, nor does it provide evidence of corporate espionage.  The list purporting to show \"70 CCP Members on Pfizer's Investment Board\" shows no such thing. Some of the names on this list relate to people who work for Pfizer, but none of these names were on Pfizer's \"investment board.\" Several of the names on this list also appeared to be made up out of whole cloth or referred to politicians unaffiliated with Pfizer.  While it's possible that members (or former members) of the Chinese Communist Party work for Pfizer, and while China has been accused of corporate espionage in the past, the list purporting to show \"70 CCP Members on Pfizer's Investment Board\" appears to be have been created by searching for Pfizer employees with Chinese-sounding names.

        "justification": "On 26 December 2018, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump made a surprise visit to Al Asad Air Base in Iraq for a Christmastime meeting with military members who were stationed in the war zone there. Shortly thereafter, a claim began circulating on social media that Melania Trump was the first First Lady to undertake such a trip: surprise visit   The definition of what constitutes a 'war zone' or a 'combat zone' is somewhat subjective and therefore variable. Although these terms may invoke images of areas under immediate threat of military attack, we found no record of any first lady's traveling to or remaining in an area where armed hostilities were actively taking place. These terms are often used to refer to the general areas in which a war is being fought and do not necessarily have strict or well-defined boundaries, as encapsulated in the IRS' definition of such: definition The term combat zone(s) is a general term ... and includes all of the following hostile areas where military may serve: actual combat areas, direct combat support areas, and qualified hazardous duty areas. With respect to deadline extensions, the term combat zone(s) includes contingency operations areas. That said, by the standards of contemporaneous reporting, Melania Trump was not the first First Lady to make such a trip. Although our list may not be comprehensive, we found that first ladies Eleanor Roosevelt, Pat Nixon, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, and Laura Bush were all reported during their tenures as having ventured into \"war zones\" and other potentially dangerous territories as they visited troops stationed overseas.   Eleanor Roosevelt, for example, made several trips to war zones during World War II in the 1940s: war zones World War II \nThe First Lady was allowed to go to Guadalcanal where she visited many hospitals and again made offers to write to the families of wounded soldiers. During the course of her trip she had visited 17 islands and it was estimated that she saw over 400,000 soldiers. In the end Admiral Halsey said, she had accomplished more good than any other person or any group of civilians that had passed through my area. For Eleanor Roosevelt, the extensive travels to war zones made her even more determined to try to find a road to lasting world peace after this horrific war was over. She wrote in My Day if the generation that fights today is to lay the foundations of which a peaceful world can be built, all of us who have seen the war close range must remember what we see and carry a crusading spirit into all of our work.\n First Lady Pat Nixon was also described as having taken part in a \"dangerous visit\" to \"an active combat zone\" in Vietnam in 1969: described \nWhile neither of Pat Nixons sons-in-law saw active duty in South Vietnam, the First Lady herself came close to witnessing it herself. Joining the President on a dangerous visit to the embattled nation, she was the first First Lady to enter an active combat zone since Eleanor Roosevelt. During her time there, Mrs. Nixon spent nearly all of it focused on the troops -- both those on break from the field and those being cared for in medic hospital units.\n Since 1969, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, and Laura Bush have all traveled to military bases overseas to meet with U.S. troops. First Lady Barbara Bush visited Saudi Arabia over Thanksgiving in 1990, in the midst of Operation Desert Shield (the build-up of troops and the defenses of Saudi Arabia at the beginning of the Gulf War): Saudi Arabia President Bush didn't come to Saudi Arabia with any guns or missiles, but he had a much more effective secret weapon -- Barbara Bush. For homesick American troops celebrating Thanksgiving just 80 miles from the Kuwaiti border, she was everybody's missing Mom whose smile sent spirits soaring ... In a day that took the Bushes and their entourage from Jiddah on the Red Sea to Dhahran on the Persian Gulf, the First Couple ate two holiday turkey dinners and talked to hundreds of men and women in two encampments at secret locations in the desert and on a U.S. ship in the gulf. Mrs. Bush isn't the only First Lady to visit American troops abroad. Eleanor Roosevelt went to the South Pacific in 1943, and Pat Nixon went with President Nixon to Vietnam in 1969. While Hillary Clinton was First Lady, she traveled to Bosnia in 1996. Although active hostilities in Bosnia had ended a few months prior to her visit, officials still considered the area a \"potential\" combat zone: traveled \nProtected by sharpshooters, Hillary Rodham Clinton swooped into a military zone by Black Hawk helicopter to deliver a personal \"thank you, thank you, thank you\" to U.S. troops. \"They're making a difference,\" the first lady said of the 18,500 Americans working as peacekeepers in Bosnia. Mrs. Clinton became the first presidential spouse since Eleanor Roosevelt to make such an extensive trip into what can be considered a hostile area, although others have visited hot spots. [T]he highlight of her trip was the visits she made to two fortified posts outside the U.S. base in Tuzla. Even President Bill Clinton, restricted to the base by bad weather in January, did not see as much of this war-ravaged region as Mrs. Clinton did.\n Although Clinton's trip to Bosnia may have scored her political points during her time as First Lady, that visit would later become a subject of controversy and criticism. During the 2008 presidential campaign Clinton was accused of exaggerating the dangers of her Bosnia visit for saying she had been \"under sniper fire\" when she landed at the Tuzla Air Base. under sniper fire (It should be noted that when Hillary Clinton's trip to Bosnia in 1996 was touted as \"the first time since Roosevelt that a first lady has voyaged to a potential combat zone,\" that claim was similarly debunked.) debunked.) Laura Bush also visited troops overseas during her time as first lady, paying a brief visit to Afghanistan in 2005: Afghanistan \nUnder heavy protection in this dusty, dangerous capital, Laura Bush talked with Afghan women freed from Taliban repression and urged greater rights. She expressed high hopes, envisioning a day when tourists would flock here for vacations. There were reminders of war at every turn of Bush's visit. U.S. soldiers in camouflage fatigues manned M-60 machine guns at both ends of four transport helicopters that flew the first lady and her entourage to events around Kabul. Apache attack helicopters that shadowed the aircraft provided further security.\n Radcliffe, Donnie.  \"Barbara Bush's Pilgrimage.\"\r\n  The Washington Post.  23 November 1990.

        "justification": "Early on in his bid for the United States presidency, Donald Trump adopted a catchphrase that encapsulated his entire political philosophy in just two words: \"America first.\" The slogan was front and center in Trump's first major foreign policy speech as a candidate in April 2016: speech My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first. Has to be. That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make. America first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. He then used the phrase to characterize his planned approach to immigration policy, which would be much more restrictive than policies of the previous few decades: characterize We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others. Remember, under a Trump administration it's called America first. Remember that. To choose immigrants based on merit. Merit, skill, and proficiency. Doesn't that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. It would also become the centerpiece of Trump's inauguration address in January 2017: address We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it's going to be only America first, America first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. In addition to figuring prominently in his speeches, \"America first\" has turned up regularly in Trump's tweets, often paired with his other favorite rallying cry, \"Make America great again\": cry In trade, military and EVERYTHING else, it will be AMERICA FIRST! This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 23, 2016 May 23, 2016 A vote to CUT TAXES is a vote to PUT AMERICA FIRST.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2017 November 29, 2017 As Trump's critics have accurately observed, the president did not invent the phrase \"America First,\" nor was he the first public figure to sloganize it. More to the point, they say, many of the social and political contexts in which it has been used in the past were unsavory. The Anti-Defamation League noted in an April 2016 statement urging Trump to reconsider his use of it that \"America First\" was associated before and during World War II with an isolationist political organization some of whose members openly displayed pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic tendencies: statement The most noteworthy leader of the \"America First Committee\" was Charles Lindbergh, who sympathized with the Nazis and whose rhetoric was characterized by anti-Semitism and offensive stereotypes, including assertions that Jews posed a threat to the U.S. because of their influence in motion pictures, radio, the press, and the government. \"The undercurrents of anti-Semitism and bigotry that characterized the America First movement  including the assumption that Jews who opposed the movement had their own agenda and were not acting in Americas best interest  is fortunately not a major concern today, said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. However, for many Americans, the term America First will always be associated with and tainted by this history. In a political season that already has prompted a national conversation about civility and tolerance, choosing a call to action historically associated with incivility and intolerance seems ill-advised.\" Other Trump critics identify the slogan with the infamous white supremacist hate group the Ku Klux Klan, one of whose ex-leaders, David Duke, himself ran for public office in 2016 on an \"America first\" platform. Social media memes critical of Trump's enthusiasm for the slogan use archival images and Klan memorabilia to make the point that its history is anything but innocuous: platform   The images above are authentic. The photo of KKK members marching with an \"America first\" banner dates from the 1920s and can be found in the Getty Images archive. The Ku Klux Klan \"coin\" (actually a token) bearing the slogans \"America First\" and \"Preserve Racial Purity\" on one face and \"The Invisible Empire\" on the other was struck in 1965 to celebrate the centennial of the KKK's founding, numismatists say, although it was never officially endorsed by the organization. archive say The phrase \"America first\" also appears in Klan literature as part of a longer credo, \"America first, last and forever,\" or its variant \"America first, last and always,\" as uttered by a KKK speaker quoted in the Binghamton, New York Press and Sun-Bulletin in 1923: \"I stand for America first, last and always,\" the speaker began. \"I am opposed to any organization which tries to bring in foreign and alien ideals.\" Another variant is enshrined in an \"Imperial Proclamation\" submitted as evidence during a Congressional hearing on the Klan's activities in 1921: hearing [The Klan] stands for America first  first in thought, first in affections, and first in the galaxy of nations. The Stars and Stripes forever above all other and every kind of government in the whole world. Despite their embrace of the slogan, however, there is no evidence that the Ku Klux Klan invented it, as has sometimes been alleged. There are instances of its use by politicians predating any examples we've found directly attributable to the Klan. President Woodrow Wilson ran for re-election on an \"America first\" platform in 1916, for example, in that instance using the phrase to remind voters that his isolationist stance had kept U.S. troops out of the burgeoning conflict in Europe (never mind that he abandoned that position and sent them to fight in World War I during his second term). A popular song called \"America First!\" was dedicated to Wilson and published in 1917. using America First! For that matter, Presidents Calvin Coolidge, Warren G. Harding, and William McKinley all used the catchphrase at one time or another to promote isolationist and/or protectionist foreign policies (we found an instance of McKinley being touted as having an \"America first\" agenda as long ago as 1896). In sum, the political slogan \"America First\" has a pedigree stretching back more than a hundred years, with connotations ranging from anti-expansionism and trade protectionism to outright racism and anti-Semitism. Although it has been trumpeted over time by hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, its use does not automatically confer the most heinous of those attitudes on the user  although given its less savory associations, one wonders why any informed person would embrace it today.

        "justification": "Legend:  A pedestrian who stops by to use a funeral home's restroom signs the visitors' book at the wake of a stranger and hits the jackpot.  Examples:  \n\n\n[Collected on the Internet, 1998] SPANISH LUCK There was this Spanish guy doing some business in Poland, and he came across an open funeral home with a casket laid out for viewing. Curious, he went in and was surprised to find no one there.  He felt bad for the dead guy, said a prayer over the body, and signed the registrar. A month later he got a call from the dead guy's lawyer. Seems the dead guy's will stipulated his multi-million dollar fortune be split evenly amongst all who attended his wake.  The Spanish businessman was the only one who signed the book.  [Collected on the Internet, 1995] A traveler needing to find a restroom did not want to stop in an area where there were no people.  She finally came upon a funeral home where there were lots of cars.  She went in and when she was greeted. She was asked which person she would like to visit.  She indicated she was here to see the person with no visitors and in her panic she wrote her name and address in the guest book.  She proceded to use the bathroom and left. Two months later she received a letter explaining that John Jones' will indicated that anyone visiting his funeral should inherit $50,000.  She was the only visitor so she gets the money.  It was told to me by a friend.  Her brother-in-law who is a pilot said it happened to a stewardess friend on the way home from a flight.\n Variations:   A less common version of this tale sees the only person to show up for a curmudgeon's funeral rewarded with the dead guy's estate. Origins:  Our \"fortunate funeral home visitor\" story goes back to at least 1986, when it was set in New York City.  The year 1997 saw a resurgence of the legend on the Internet when the \"Spanish Luck\" story quoted above began popping up in everyone's inbox, most likely from a garbled version of the following 1996 Associated Press story: \n\nHAMBURG, Germany (AP) - A Spanish businessman and devout Roman Catholic who stopped to pray at a church during a trip to Stockholm ended up a millionaire, the Bild newspaper said Wednesday. The church was empty except for a coffin containing the remains of a man, so Eduardo Sierra knelt down and prayed for the deceased for 20 minutes, the Hamburg-based daily said. Sierra, 35, signed a condolence book after he saw a note saying those who prayed for the dead man should enter their name and address. He noticed he was the first to sign. Several weeks later he got a call from the Swedish capital informing him he was a millionaire, Bild said. Jens Svenson, the man he had prayed for, was a 73-year-old real estate dealer with no close relatives. He had specified in his will that \"whoever prays for my soul gets all my belongings,\" Bild said.\n Even   Associated Press can get taken on occasion, and this was one of them. In the wake of that story's hitting the newsstands, various journalists tried to locate the suddenly-rich Eduardo Sierra, yet none of them had any luck, Spanish or otherwise. Neither the Swedish Embassy in Madrid, the Catholic diocese in Stockholm, nor the Swedish press knew anything about the legacy or Svenson. A German journalist then claimed she had altered the names but insisted the story had nonetheless come straight from the lucky heir, who requested anonymity. Yeah, right. The \"fortunate funeral visitor\" is a variation on a bewhiskered storyline so hoary as to be included in the 1946 round-up of overused plots: \n\nCynical old Jonas Gruber dies, leaving a will (found and read by his children years before) in which the bulk of his fortune is bequeathed to a home for cats. He has six sons; not one of them attends his funeral. He has one daughter; she goes to the funeral, and she is grief-stricken. A short time later, a lawyer reads the will  the one Jonas had left with his legal advisors  which stipulates that the old man's estate be divided between those \"loving children\"  who are on hand when he is buried.\n\n The funeral home story speaks to one of our most cherished dreams: that someday we're going to be standing in the right place at the right time to have a fortune handed to us. No adult fairy tale is better loved nor more fervently wished for. Barbara \"longing for a rub of the green(backs)\" Mikkelson  Sightings:   An episode of the Fox TV show Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction (aired 2 June 2000) dramatized the story of a woman who was the only mourner at the funeral of a stranger and later received $34 million the dead man had bequeathed to whoever attended his services.\n Last updated:  13 April 2005\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   Brunvand, Jan Harold.

Anything that appears to corroborate what people say or believe to be true about a reviled group is bound to receive wide distribution, as has been the case with the photograph displayed above. rumors This picture, if taken at face value, seemingly confirms the worst of what is rumored about U.S. servicemen in Iraq  not only has the Marine pictured killed a man (presumably a civilian), but he has also impregnated the dead man's daughter, then proudly and grinningly advertised his deeds, humiliating the Iraqi family even more by enlisting two of their young sons as unwitting accomplices.  But should the photograph be taken at face value, or was it the product of some kind of a staged set-up? Is the photograph genuine or the product of digital manipulation? If real, was it on the level, was it a joke pulled off by the Marine pictured, or was the Marine  like the two Iraqi boys in the picture  the victim of a callous prank? All we know for sure so far is that the picture does depict Lance Cpl. Ted J. Boudreaux Jr., a\nreservist with Headquarters and Service Company, 3rd Battalion, 23rd Marines, a New Orleans-based infantry unit deployed in Iraq from May to September of 2003 (Boudreaux himself is no longer on active duty), and that the circumstances of the photograph have been investigated by the Marines.  (They have not yet announced the results of their investigation.) Several different versions of this picture  each with the sign altered to reflect some other humorous message (e.g., \"My country got invaded and all I got was this lousy sign\")  were circulated on the Internet, and that phenomenon increased tremendously after the creation of site that allowed visitors to customize the Boudreaux photograph by putting their own words onto the sign.  (That site, www.ryano.net/iraq/, is no longer operational, now imparting the message \"gone forever. deal with it.\") Other versions of the picture displayed more positive messages (e.g., \"Lcpl Boudreaux saved my dad th(en) rescued my sister!\"): \n\n(Click to enlarge)\n   Some news accounts have implied that, although the message written on the pictured sign does not reflect anything Lance Cpl. Boudreaux actually did, the photograph is indeed real and was a poor attempt at humor on Boudreaux's part: \n\nDuring his deployment in Iraq last year, Boudreaux was stationed in Al Kut, the capital of Wassit Province, which runs southeast of Baghdad to the border with Iran. His duties there with a headquarters unit kept him largely confined to the big concrete hangars at an air base on the outskirts of the city, and he had little contact with locals. The photo, which shows the trio in front of a ramshackle hut, could have been taken at one of tens of thousands of locations in Iraq, including a shed outside the back entrance of the airfield where the Marines would buy soda, tobacco and trinkets such as prayer beads and head scarves from locals.  Boudreaux could not be reached for comment. His commander during the 3/23rd's Iraq mission, Lt. Col. David Couvillon, called the photo a sophomoric attempt at humor.  \"Look, he didn't actually do what that sign says,\" Couvillon said. \"This is stupid, lance corporal stuff that he thought was cute. But it's not, and I was informed the commandant of the Marine Corps had it and the Marine Corps will deal with this.\"\n As of 19 April the Marine Forces Reserve has said only that LCpl Boudreaux insists the photograph has been altered and that the (formerly \"complete\") investigation into its origins has been reopened: \n\nMaj. Gen. John J. McCarthy, Commanding General, 4th Marine Division has reopened the investigation into the photo of LCpl Corporal Ted J. Boudreaux Jr., 24, 3rd Battalion 23rd Marine Regiment, taken in Iraq. The investigation will focus on the authenticity of the photograph. We are retaining the assistance of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). Marine Forces Reserve takes this matter very seriously and will conduct a thorough and complete investigation. This photo is approximately 1 year old and was taken in Iraq when the unit deployed to that region during Operation Iraqi Freedom. LCpl. Boudreaux maintains that the photo in question has been altered from the original. Marine Forces Reserve would ask that media respect this Marine and his family's privacy. Because this matter is ongoing we cannot comment further on the investigation. When the  investigation is complete we will provide additional information.\n LCpl. Boudreaux has told reporters that the sign in the picture originally read \"Welcome Marines!\" but was altered by someone else.  He has not, however, (publicly) produced a version of the original photograph or identified who might have altered it.  (If the photo was indeed manipulated, someone involved in the process had to be sufficiently acquainted with Boudreaux to be able to match his name and rank with his picture.)

According to the email, a philanthropist named Jeff Green had decided to give away $1 million each to 20 different lucky recipients. However, this had all the signs of a classic email scam. Jeff Green scam According to a screenshot captured by a reader, the email appeared like this:  We transcribed the scam email below: scam From: Jeff Green Foundation Subject: My philanthropy! To: YOU Reply-To: privatewealth.donation@webmail.hu Greetings to you and your family. In a thousand years, I never thought I would do something like this.

I spent hours listening to him, his stories, and the twists and turns of choice and fate that led him to a life on the streets. His journey deeply affected me, and I found myself dwelling on it a great deal over the following months, unable to shake one core question that was taking root in my mind - Why is he out here on the streets in the December cold while I am living a more comfortable life? I think this adage is generally true: luck is preparation meeting opportunity. But I also understand that many people experience major life events that obstruct their preparation and as a result, opportunity passes them by. I also believe that we all encounter people who can propel us forward or hold us back. No one gets to their situation in life alone, good or bad. I didn't get to this statistically outlying position alone, and neither did James. Money cannot buy happiness. Money can buy things that make life more enjoyable. But those things and that enjoyment are always fleeting. When you think about the problems you face in life, the accumulation of things is rarely the solution. My philanthropy is not about politics or handouts - it is about getting the best outcomes for all the potential talent, which can only benefit our nation, and humankind. It will help people step up to opportunity, not lay back. I will give away the vast majority of my wealth through data-driven philanthropy before or at my death. My target is more than 90 percent of my wealth. But I will also give of my time, my most precious commodity, to allocate those funds deliberately, and to be personally engaged. So I decided I was going to contact 20 people via their email address which I paid for from a Data Firm. If you receive this email, I am giving you $1 Million. Thinking about it again, I must be crazy to do something like this but crazy is what made me who I am today so lets go for it! All you have to do is reply to this email with your full names and you will be paid $1 Million. My Life's Mission is to deploy capital against humanity's toughest problems. Jeff Green. A search of Twitter showed that several users were curious whether the \"Jeff Green Foundation\" email was legitimate: Twitter    We didn't find any similar messages available on Facebook, but it's likely that some users were discussing the email in private posts only visible to friends. Facebook Some of the paragraphs in the \"Jeff Green Foundation\" email scam were copied and pasted from the text of a genuine letter written by a real philanthropist named Jeff T. Green. In November 2021, Green truly did pledge to try to give away \"more than 90 percent\" of his billions in wealth. scam a genuine letter billions However, there's no indication that Green or his foundation had anything to do with the email scam. scam We quickly noticed several issues with the \"Jeff Green Foundation\" message. Before the email got into the \"when I was 17\" story from the genuine letter, several words were either capitalized or not capitalized that should have been the reverse. For example, one usage of the word \"I\" was left to be lowercase as \"i\" in the same sentence as an oddly-placed comma: \"My Name is Jeff Green, Below is a Link of me and what i do.\" Additionally, the sentence was poorly worded. The message also asked recipients to respond to privatewealth.donation@webmail.hu. The idea that a billionaire philanthropist would publish an email with such poor grammar and, at the same time, ask people to respond to a fairly generic Hungarian email address, did not scream \"legitimate.\" We reached out to a company associated with Green to see if they had been alerted to the scam that used his name. We will update this story if we receive a statement. scam In sum, no, the \"Jeff Green Foundation\" emails that promised $1 million each to 20 different people was not a legitimate giveaway. Jeff T.

        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  North Korean official Jang Sung-taek was executed by being thrown into a cage with 120 starved dogs. FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, January 2014] \nDid North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un kill his Uncle by feeding him and his assistants to starving dogs?\n\n   Origins:  On 13 December 2013, North Korean state media announced that Jang Sung-taek, the uncle of North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un, had been tried by a special military tribunal of the Ministry of State Security and executed.   Jang, who was vice-chairman of North Korea's  National Defence Commission (a very high political position) and considered to be North Korea's second most powerful man, had been accused of \"anti-party, counter-revolutionary factional acts,\" including affairs with multiple women, harboring \"politically-motivated ambition,\" obstructing \"the party's guidance over judicial, prosecution and people's security bodies\" and hampering \"the nation's economic affairs.\"  Jang Sung-taek's execution was perceived in the western press as evidence that Kim Jong-un was engaging in a ruthless purge of potential political rivals that provided \"another example of the extreme brutality of the North Korean regime.\" The South Korean press and similar news outlets initially reported that Jang had (presumably) been executed by a machine gun firing squad, as two of his confidants had been the previous week: reported \n\nJang Song-thaek, who served as a vice chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission, was executed shortly after a military trial found him guilty of \"the anti-party, counter-revolutionary factional\" charges, according to the North's official media Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in an English dispatch. \"The accused is a traitor to the nation for all ages who perpetrated anti-party, counter-revolutionary factional acts in a bid to overthrow the leadership of our party and state and the socialist system,\" the viciously-worded report said. Jang \"would be sentenced to death,\" as the special military tribunal confirmed that his subversion attempt \"is a crime punishable by Article 60 of the DPRK Criminal Code,\" it said, citing its official name of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The decision of capital punishment \"was immediately executed,\" the report said, condemning him as \"a wicked political careerist, trickster and traitor for all ages in the name of the revolution and the people.\" Seoul's ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker Seo Sang-kee, head of the legislature's Intelligence Committee, said the North is presumed to have used a machine gun in executing Jang, just as it did when removing his two close confidants last week.\n However, the Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po reported (in an account picked up two weeks later by Singapore's Straits Times and then spread by western news outlets) that Jang had been executed via a process known as quan jue (i.e., execution by dogs) in which he and five of his aides were stripped naked and thrown into a cage with 120 dogs that had been starved for three days. The famished dogs then proceeded to tear apart and then devour Jang and his aides in a hour-long process that was personally supervised by Kim Jong-un and witnessed by 300 senior officials: \n\nBeijing's displeasure is expressed through the publication of a detailed account of Jang's brutal execution in Wen Wei Po, its official mouthpiece, in Hong Kong, on Dec 12. Unlike previous executions of political prisoners which were carried out by firing squads with machine guns, Jang was stripped naked and thrown into a cage, along with his five closest aides. Then 120 hounds, starved for three days, were allowed to prey on them until they were completely eaten up. This is called \"quan jue\", or execution by dogs. The report said the entire process lasted for an hour, with Mr Kim Jong Un, the supreme leader in North Korea, supervising it along with 300 senior officials. The horrifying report vividly depicted the brutality of the young North Korean leader.\n However, this item stemmed from a single source (Wen Wei Po) which has a poor reputation for reliability (it ranked 19th out of 21 print media sources for reliability in a survey of Hong Kong residents), and which itself cited no source for its reporting.

        "justification": "Claim:  Congress supported a bailout of AIG because that company insures the Congressional pension trust. FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, January 2009] \nPoliticians!!!! Did you ever wonder? I couldn't figure out why would the Congress let some firms go under and then bend over backwards to help others.\nThis makes sense now!!!!!! This sounds almost too logical...... why hasn't it gotten national press coverage? Remember when this economic crisis hit, and Congress let Bear Sterns go under, pushed a bunch of forced marriages between banks, etc.? Then they bailed out AIG. At the time, I thought: \"That's strange what does an insurance company have to do with this crisis?\" I think I just found the answer. Among other things, AIG INSURES THE PENSION TRUST OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS!! No wonder they got bailed out right away! To hell with the people, let's protect our future, said all our Senators and Congressmen.  Nice to see where their loyalties lie! I'm from the government and I'm here to help myself !\n Origins:  As the U.S. government began, in the latter part of 2008, to grapple with growing economic turmoil and the prospect that many large U.S. financial and corporate institutions were on the brink of failure, one of the vexing issues it confronted was which businesses it should attempt to rescue.  Should the government take over or provide direct financial assistance (\"bailouts\") to mortgage finance  companies (particularly Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), or to the banking industry, or to the auto industry? One of corporate entities \"bailed out\" by the government was the insurance giant American International Group, commonly known as AIG.  In September 2008 the Federal Reserve (not Congress) provided AIG with an $85 billion loan in exchange for a 79.9% equity stake, and the Federal Reserve also provided another $37.8 billion loan to AIG three weeks later and subsequently gave the company access to another $20.9 billion.  (These loans were restructured in November 2008 to provide a total bailout package of over $150 billion to AIG.) Why did the government decide to assist AIG?  The item reproduced above posits that it was pure self-interest:  Supposedly Congress \"bailed out\" AIG because that company \"insures the pension trust of the United States Congress\" while supposedly allowing other financial institutions to wither and die or pushing them into \"forced marriages.\"  (Global financial services firm Bear Stearns didn't \"go under\"; it was acquired by JPMorgan Chase, with assistance from the Federal Reserve, back in March 2008. In other transactions, Wells Fargo bought Wachovia, and JPMorgan Chase purchased Washington Mutual.) acquired However, AIG was more than just an ordinary \"insurance company.\"  That firm insured the debt of other financial institutions, and government officials were greatly concerned that AIG's failure could have a cascading effect that would produce catastrophic results among the entire U.S. (and global) financial industry: \n\nWhat frightened Fed and Treasury officials was not simply the prospect of another giant corporate bankruptcy, but A.I.G.'s role as an enormous provider of esoteric financial insurance contracts to investors who bought complex debt securities. They effectively required A.I.G. to cover losses suffered by the buyers in the event the securities defaulted. It meant A.I.G. was potentially on the hook for billions of dollars worth of risky securities that were once considered safe. If A.I.G. had collapsed  and been unable to pay all of its insurance claims  institutional investors around the world would have been instantly forced to reappraise the value of those securities, and that in turn would have reduced their own capital and the value of their own debt. Small investors, including anyone who owned money market funds with A.I.G. securities, could have been hurt, too. And some insurance policy holders were worried, even though they have some protections. \"It would have been a chain reaction,\" said Uwe Reinhardt, a professor of economics at Princeton University. \"The spillover effects could have been incredible.\"\n Associated Press economics writer Jeannine Aversa explained the importance of the government's decision in the wake of the AIG bailout: \n\nQ: Why is it important to keep AIG afloat? A: AIG is a global colossus, with operations in more than 130 countries. It is so interconnected with other financial firms that its problems have a jolting ripple effect both in the United States and abroad. AIG was pushed to the brink of bankruptcy in September [2008] when its credit rating was downgraded and it could not post the collateral for which it was obligated under the \"credit default swap\" contracts it had issued. Credit default swaps are a type of corporate debt insurance. The Fed raced to the rescue at that time to prevent AIG's failure, which could have triggered billions of dollars in losses at other banks and financial firms that bought these swaps from AIG  sending them into failure as well.\n As a final nail in the coffin of the \"AIG insures the pension trust of the United States Congress\" claim, we reproduce the following response provided to us by Charlie Armstrong, AIG's Senior Director of Advertising & Global Branding: \n\nIn response to your question as to whether AIG insures the US Congressional Trust, we don't.  In fact, we've been told that no private company insures federal pensions  such a product doesn't exist.  Further, none of our financial services companies provide advisory services to Congress' pension fund.  We've explored this issue at length with our business units and have found no connection whatsoever to the fund. This rumor surfaced recently on a blog.  We're not sure who started the rumor, or why, but the rumor is baseless.\n\n The OpenSecrets web site lists Barack Obama among the many politicians from both parties who have previously received campaign contributions (not \"bonus payments\" or \"bailout money,\" as is frequently reported) from AIG. campaign contributions Last updated:  18 March 2009\n    Aversa, Jeannine.  \"Meltdown 101: Why Did the AIG Bailout Get Bigger?\"\n   The Guardian.  12 November 2008.

            "Was a spoof of terrorist threat levels written by English comic John Cleese?"
        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  A spoof of terrorist threat levels was written by English comic John Cleese. FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, August 2013] \nFrom the BBC - by John Cleese. ANNOUNCEMENT The English are feeling the pinch in relation to recent terrorist threats and have therefore raised their security level from \"Miffed\" to \"Peeved.\" Soon, though, security levels may be raised yet again to \"Irritated\" or even \"A Bit Cross.\" The English have not been \"A Bit Cross\" since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorized from \"Tiresome\" to \"A Bloody Nuisance.\" The last time the British issued a \"Bloody Nuisance\" warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada. The Scots have raised their threat level from \"Pissed Off\" to \"Let's get the Bastards.\" They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years. The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from \"Run\" to \"Hide.\" The only two higher levels in France are \"Collaborate\" and \"Surrender.\" The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability. Italy has increased the alert level from \"Shout Loudly and Excitedly\" to \"Elaborate Military Posturing.\" Two more levels remain: \"Ineffective Combat Operations\" and \"Change Sides.\" The Germans have increased their alert state from \"Disdainful Arrogance\" to \"Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs.\" They also have two higher levels: \"Invade a Neighbor\" and \"Lose.\" Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels. The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy. Americans meanwhile and as usual are carrying out pre-emptive strikes, on all of their allies, just in case. And in the southern hemisphere... New Zealand has also raised its security levels - from \"baaa\" to \"BAAAA!\". Due to continuing defense cutbacks (the airforce being a squadron of spotty teenagers flying paper aeroplanes and the navy some toy boats in the Prime Minister's bath), New Zealand only has one more level of escalation, which is \"I hope Australia will come and rescue us\". Australia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from \"No worries\" to \"She'll be right, mate\". Three more escalation levels remain: \"Crikey!', \"I think we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend\" and \"The barbie is cancelled\". So far no situation has ever warranted use of the final escalation level.\n Origins:  This spoof of the various systems implemented after the 9/11 attacks to warn the public about the possibility of future terrorist activities, melded with stereotypes of several different nationalities, appears to have originated in July 2005 (just after a series of terrorist bombings hit London's public transport system earlier that month), with its early forms being a fair bit shorter: terrorist activities originated \n\nAs London is hit by the second wave of bombings in two weeks, the Government has raised the terror warning level from 'miffed' to 'peeved'. Whilst many people commented with respect at the stoical attitude of Londoners to the first wave of attacks, Londoners are losing their traditional reserve and may soon require the terror level warning to be raised to 'irritated' or even 'a bit cross'. A government spokesmen commented upon the seriousness of the situation. \"London has not been a bit cross since the height of the Blitz in 1940 when supplies of tea ran out for almost three weeks\", said a representative of the Security Services. \"It is as a mark of the seriousness with which Londoners are taking the situation that we have recently been forced to recategorise suicide bombers from 'tiresome' to 'a bloody nuisance', and the last time we had a 'bloody nuisance' warning level was during the great fire of 1666.\" On the streets, Londoners reacted with uncharacteristic anger to news of the latest attacks, with some members of the public reacting with harsh language to the news that they might be delayed on their homeward trips by up to twenty minutes.  \"It really is the absolute limit,\" said Reginald Boggis, 42, of East Ham. \"These terrorists. Not content with blowing things up, they then have to spoil the day for everyone. That's just irritating, that is. If they wanted to get things changed, they should write an angry letter to Points of View. That's what my wife and I always do.\" Tony Blair is expected to make political capital out of the situation as soon as his focus groups report on the mood of the nation. In other news, Britain reeled today at the news Australia were all out for 190 runs in the first test. \"Good heavens!\", said cricket fan Stan Higginbottom. \"We showed the Aussies, what for, eh? What's that? More terrorists? Well, that's bloody typical, isn't it?\"\n From there, this item followed a pattern very similar to an earlier satirical piece about the UK's revoking the independence of the United States: What began as a simple bit of humor penned by an anonymous wag and set loose on the Internet was  revoking successively fleshed out and embellished by many different hands, growing longer and longer, until someone erroneously attributed the whole thing to English comic John Cleese, a former Monty Python trouper.

        ],
        "justification": "Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here. here During his 2020 presidential campaign, U.S. President Donald Trump on multiple occasions claimed his Democratic opponent Joe Biden would impose the \"biggest tax increase in history\" if voters elected him. In an August interview on Fox News, for instance, Trump said of Democrats: said They want to tax $4 trillion, going to be the biggest tax increase in history by far. It will triple up records, and they're big taxers. It's just something that won't work. We'll have  you will see a depression, the likes of which you have never seen. In the following weeks, he reiterated the claim  that \"you are going to have the tax increase of your life\" if Biden wins the 2020 election  in social media posts and during campaign events, without explaining who would bear the brunt of the alleged hike. Trump tweeted on Oct. 5: tweeted   Below is an analysis of Biden's tax proposal assessing whether it would indeed raise taxes by an amount never seen before in modern U.S. history, and who would most feel its impact. According to his campaign website, Biden ran for president on the promise that he would change multiple aspects of the country's tax system  specifically in regards to individual income and payroll taxes, business taxes, and tax expenditures. campaign website promise The proposed changes would repeal aspects of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the Trump administration and Republicans framed as a solution to fuel economic growth ,and Democrats saw as a gift to the country's richest individuals and large corporations at the expense of low-to-middle-class Americans. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Specifically, Biden's tax plan would roll back the act's income tax reductions for the country's top bracket of taxpayers, as well as expand that category to include Americans with incomes over $400,000 annually, rather than just those who earn more than $518,400. $518,400 His proposal would also require that group of top earners to limit deductions and pay an additional Social Security payroll tax, per an analysis by Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Millionaires and billionaires would be subject to taxes on long-term capital gains at ordinary  not preferential  income tax rates. analysis long-term capital gains Additionally, Biden's plan would increase the top tax rate for corporations from 21% to 28% and impose a 15% minimum tax on companies' book income, according to his campaign website. It would also reduce tax subsidies for commercial real estate and fossil fuels and incentivize renewable energy investments, among other changes. All of that said, the country's richest taxpayers and corporations would cover the majority of Biden's proposed tax increases  not average Americans  both in dollar amounts and as a share of their incomes. But let's look at the anticipated impact at a granular level. All income levels would face some sort of tax burden in 2021 under Biden's plan (we explain more below), though the highest-income households would pay higher income taxes directly and see substantially larger increases than anyone else. Gleckman made the following estimations: His plan would raise taxes on households in the top 1% of the income distribution (those with income more than $837,000) by an average of about $299,000. [...] By contrast, taxpayers in the middle-income quintile (those with income between $52,000 and $93,000) would experience an average tax increase of just $260. [...] Taxpayers in the bottom quintile (those with income less than $26,000) would see an average tax increase of only $30. That added burden on low- and middle-income households representing about 2% of the proposed change  would be an indirect result of employers shifting the cost of the higher corporate tax rate to some workers. Corporations on a grand scale would slightly lower wages and investment income, which would, on average, more than offset the effects of Biden's new tax credits, the center concluded. Alicyn McLeod, a tax adviser and writer for Accounting Today, said in October 2020: Accounting Today Bidens proposal is primarily motivated by fairness. Many U.S. taxpayers are concerned that large corporations arent paying their fair share. While understandable, this position ignores the belief among many tax and economic policy experts that a significant portion of corporate taxes are ultimately paid by workers, shareholders, and consumers as opposed to companies themselves.  In sum, the overwhelming majority of Americans  those who earn $400,000 or less annually  would not see their taxes increase as a direct result of Biden's tax proposal, and the top 1% earners would shoulder the brunt of his proposed hike. But low-to-middle-class workers would see slightly lower investment returns and wages as a result of corporate tax increases, according to economists' analysis including a a budgetary model by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. budgetary model Biden's plan would raise about $3.38 trillion in additional tax revenue over 10 years, according to the university's model. Concurrently, per Gleckman's analysis, that would amount to an increase in federal revenue by about 1.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is the economy's total output of goods and services, and economists rely on it greatly to measure the economy's health and how fiscal or regulatory policies could impact it  not raw dollar amounts that don't consider inflation and population changes. To determine the legitimacy of Trump's claim, we considered federal tax proposals and their impact on GDP over decades. Of almost two dozen congressional tax bills that increased federal tax revenues between 1940 and 2012, for example, the five largest tax increases raised annual revenue between 1.33% and 5.04% of GDP, according to a 2013 compilation of such records by the U.S. Department of Treasury. the U.S. Department of Treasury The following table compiled by the Tax Foundation, another independent public policy think tank, showed where Biden's plan would stand in comparison to those other proposals: Tax Foundation   According to those findings, Biden's tax proposal, if enacted by Congress, would amount to the fifth-largest tax increase since the 1940s  not the biggest hike in modern U.S. history.

            "Although President Trump cited accurate national debt figures in a  tweet, the newsworthiness of that information was questionable."
        ],
        "justification": "On 25 February 2017, President Donald Trump tweeted to complain that the news media were not reporting his success in reducing the national debt during his first month in office: tweeted The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 February 25, 2017  As noted by news media from the Los Angeles Times to the Washington Post, the tweet appeared closely after a \"Fox & Friends\" segment in which guest (and former presidential candidate) Herman Cain reported the same numbers. That story appeared to have its origins in a post on the conservative blog Gateway Pundit (\"Amazing! Trump Cuts US Debt by $12 Billion In His First Month\") which took credit for the Trump tweet in an update to their story. Los Angeles Times Washington Post took credit There are two claims implicit in the tweet. The first claim is simply the factual nature of the figures reported. The second is that the numbers represent an item worthy of coverage. The numbers are factual in a literal sense, according to the online debt history search application offered by the US Treasury Department: application   Though the numbers regarding the debt at the end of Trumps and President Obamas first month are factual, their significance as a reportable bit of information or as an indicator of the impact or success of Trumps policies is questionable. Speaking to CBS News, Maya MacGuineas, director of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget, said: said \nIt is true the debt outstanding declined by $12 billion in the first month of Donald Trumps presidency. We applaud the president for focusing on the debt as an important metric of success and economic health, but would point out that the improvement this early in his term has to do with normal fluctuations in spending and revenues rather than new policies he has implemented.\n Indeed, in terms of newsworthiness (or lack thereof), sporadic reductions of the debt are not uncommon (in red, below) on a month-to-month basis, according to The \"Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States\" reports released during the course of President Obama's second term in office: reports \n  \n  In fact, the Washington Posts Wonkblog reports that, even on a day-to-day basis, fluctuations even greater than the one Trump referenced are not unheard of: reports \nThe Gateway Pundit article says that the change in debt under Trump translates to a 0.1 percent reduction in the U.S. debt burden. Actually, it's .06 percent between Jan. 20 and Feb. 21  a very small change. (The national debt has gone up or down by as much .19 percent on single days this year.)\n Secondly, there are few mechanisms by which any actions Trump has taken as president would affect the national debt thus far, as he has not signed into law any financial measures related to federal borrowing. While there are arguments to be made that other factors related to Trumps presidency could affect the debt, the Post has said it is unlikely, and also impossible to quantify: \nIts impossible to know whether Trumps election has really had time to filter through to concretely affect the economy. Congress has not passed any of his policies yet. The stock market has certainly continued to boom, but it was already rising before the election. While it's possible anticipation of tax cuts or regulatory relief is heating up the economy and leading to increased government receipts, investors might also be choosing not to sell assets to avoid current capital gains tax rates and waiting to see whether the Republican-dominated Congress successfully slashes rates.\n Keith Hennessey, a former director of the U.S. National Economic Council appointed by George W. Bush, wrote a hypothetical memo to Congress analyzing the 45th Presidents tweet. In this document, he stated that neither Obama nor Trump had any effect on the national debt in their first month in office: hypothetical memo document \nGovernment borrowing in January and February is the byproduct of spending and tax policies set by Congress the year before. President Obama signed the fiscal stimulus law on February 17, 2009, but it took months before that began to change government cash flows and borrowing requirements. President Trump has so far not measurably affected fiscal policy in general or government borrowing in specific. Its unfair to assign any responsibility for borrowing in the first month to either president.\n Hennessey added that it is equally unfair to compare the 2009 economic situation with the 2017 one: \nGDP was plummeting when President Obama took office. Tax revenues were down, automatic stabilizer payments (e.g., unemployment insurance and safety net spending) were up, and funds were being spent from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). In early 2009 government was borrowing a lot because the economy was weak, not because of President Obamas policies. In contrast, the U.S. economy is now growing. The smaller borrowing requirement for this month is mostly a result of this economic difference, and may also in part be simply an artifact of choosing such a short timeframe for comparison.\n More to the point, however, the fact that the day-to-day and month-to-month fluctuations of the national debt are so volatile, he argued, is why analysts dont typically look at the data for these time periods, accordingo to Hennessey: \nHad the president / Mr. Cain ended his timeframe one day earlier this tweet would have been invalid and debt would have increased (by just $1 B) in the first month. This is why analysts look at debt on an annual basis rather than daily/weekly/monthly.\n It should also be noted that, as the Fox and Friends segment aired on one of the nations most popular national cable news networks, \"the media\" did indeed report on this story. The reason it didnt pick up much steam is that the numbers were not newsworthy because they were taken out of context and are likely irrelevant to President Trump's actions in office. UPDATE: 28 February 2017 -- Modified the status of this article to \"MIXTURE\" to better explicate the difference between the accuracy of the debt figures and their newsworthiness.

State Defense Forces are authorized by state and federal law and are under the command of the governor of each state. State Defense Forces are distinct from their states National Guard in that they cannot\nbecome federal entities.\" Mr. Obama is fearful of these State Defense Forces, in that he does not have control of said forces, and with the U.S. Military stretched to near breaking from multiple deployments and theatre actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, these State military forces would be under the direct command and authority of the Governors in which states have said forces. In essence, the Governors would have de facto control of the United States. The two Governors leading this move are: Tim Pawlenty, Governor of Minnesota; and Rick Perry, Governor of Texas. Both of these State Governors stated they have: \"deep fear the President is destroying their Nation.\" Governor Pawlenty's fear of Obama is that since Obama took office he has appeased America's enemies and has shunned some of America's strongest allies, especially Israel. Governor Perry has declared that Obama is punishing his State of Texas by dumping tens-of-thousands of illegal Mexican immigrants into the cities and small towns of Texas. Governor Perry further recently stated: \"If Barack Obama's Washington doesn't stop being so oppressive, Texans might feel compelled to renounce their American citizenry and secede from the union.\"  NOT possible but would be great! Obama fearing a revolution against him by the states, has moved swiftly by nationalizing nearly all National Guard Forces in multiple states; Georgia, Alabama, Kansas, Minnesota, Tennessee, Virginia, Louisiana, South Carolina  to name a few. The Governors of the Great States of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia still have under their Command-and-Control the State Defense Forces to go against U.S. Federal forces should the need arise. Also important to note: There are NO U.S. laws prohibiting National Guard troops from also joining their State's Defense Forces. This dilemma occurred during the Civil War with many \"citizen soldiers\" choosing to serve their states instead of the Federal Government. This is a fluid and still developing situation that warrants close attention.\n\n Origins:  This item about President Obama's supposedly having served 14 state governors with National Security Letters threatening their arrests if they do not immediately halt plans to form State Defense Forces  was widely circulated on the Internet in May 2013, that outbreak apparently stemming from a single source, a 7 May 2013 post on ItMakesSenseBlog.com (which has since been deleted). ItMakesSenseBlog.com However, that go-round was just a word-for-word repetition of a rumor that was first floated as far back as May 2010.  Needless to say, none of multitude of sites that has reproduced this item has included any information documenting its claims, and in the three years since the rumor originally appeared no news outlet has reported anything  May 2010 about President Obama's having threatened to arrest multiple state governors on treason charges.  (The notion that the President was attempting to intimidate 28% of the country's chief executives by throwing them in the hoosegow and charging them with a capital crime is something that would have popped up in the press by now if there were anything to it.) Moreover, this item displays a typical conspiracy-think misunderstanding of the terms and concepts it throws about.  National Security Letters (NSLs) are demand letters used by government agencies including the FBI, CIA, and DHS to request information (such as telephone and Internet  records) relevant to investigations involving national security and terrorism issues; they aren't arrest warrants or forms of threatening missives issued by presidents to demand that others comply with their orders.  (And since NSLs typically include non-disclosure clauses forbidding recipients from revealing their contents, or even their receipt, how could the author of this item know that such letters had been sent or exactly how many governors had received them?) State defense forces (SDFs) are military units that operate under the authority of a state government (commanded by the governor) but are distinct from the state's National Guard forces and cannot be federalized.  Federal law (32 USC  109) allows that any state \"in addition to its National Guard ... may, as provided by its laws, organize and maintain defense forces.\"  Nearly every state has laws authorizing the creation and maintenance of state defense forces, and 22 states currently have active SDFs.  Given that state defense forces are authorized under both federal and state laws, and that the President has no authority to prohibit or restrict their organization and training, the formation of an SDF is not an action for which a state governor could be arrested and charged with treason. 32 USC  109 In short, this isn't just a rumor that's lacking in any supporting evidence; it isn't even plausible in concept.

        "justification": "FACT CHECK: Did the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia \"remove\" their 4th of July festivities in order to avoid offending Muslims observing Ramadan?  Claim: The U.S. Embassy in Indonesia \"removed\" their 4th of July festivities due to demands of Muslims who were offended that the date fell during the holy month of Ramadan.   MIXTURE Example:   Several sites have been saying that a US embassy moved the 4th of July celebration to June 4th so that it would not interfere with Ramadan in that particular country here are a few links to to those articles. There are more. Is a US embassy sovereign US soil or is it subject to the laws of that country?   Origins:  On 7 June 2015, a number of web sites (includingAmerican Thinker and theFederalist Papers) published articles reporting that the U.S.Embassy in Indonesian capital of Jakarta had moved a celebration of America's Independence Day from July to June because its July 4th date fell during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. American Thinker Federalist Papers Both articles referenced two sources: A5 June 2015 article published by the Jakarta Post, and a 6 June 2015 blog post by anti-Islamic commentator Pamela Gellar. The first article was titled \"US Embassy Celebrates 4thof July Earlier Out of Respect for Ramadhan\" and opened with a lengthy photo caption that contained perhaps the most substantive coverage of the issue: article blog post US Ambassador to Indonesia Robert Blake (right), Jakarta Governor Basuki Ahok Tjahaja Purnama (left) and Peoples Consultative Assembly (MPR) speaker Zulkifli Hasan (second left) cut a cake to mark the anniversary of the 239th US Independence Day at the ambassadors residence in Jakarta on Thursday. The celebration was held a month ahead of July 4 so as not to disrupt the Ramadhan fasting month, starting later this month, when people will be busier with breaking-the-fast events and prayers. The article offered a first-paragraph-only mention of the U.S. embassy's rescheduling of July 4th festivities in Indonesia before segueing into a story about the event itself and the Embassy's ongoing interests in that country:   The United States Embassy enjoyed its annual 4th of July celebration on Thursday, June 4, one month early, in order to respect the upcoming Ramadhan month, which will begin on June 17 and last for one month.   By the time Pamela Geller discovered this otherwise unremarkable article inthe Jakarta Post, what had up until that point been described as a voluntary, minor scheduling decision based upon local customs took on a new adversarial tone:   Why is it we always have to bend, accommodate, submit? This is Indonesia  always held up as a shining example of a moderate Muslim country (despite the sharia  i.e., floggings, whippings, gender apartheid, creed apartheid, etc.) Sharia compliance always give way to more demands for further sharia compliance. Islamic supremacism supersedes July 4th.   However, the source article made no mention of any \"demands\" being placed upon the U.S. Embassy to move their 4th of July celebration, or of any mandates of \"Sharia\" that prohibited the Independence Day observance from being held during Ramadan: Geller's description injected an antagonistic dynamic not present in the newspaper from which she sourced her post. The rumor then moved toAmerican Thinker, where all logical sense was stripped away:   In a mind-boggling gesture of official US Government dhimmitude, the US Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia celebrated our sacred Independence Day holiday on June 4, so as to avoid any conflict with the month-long Ramadan celebration. If you think any Islamic countries  there are 57 of them (not counting ISIS) that count themselves officially Islamic  will move their DC embassy's celebration of Ramadan to accommodate our Independence holiday, I have some bridges to sell you.   (The notion that foreign embassy employees in the U.S. quietly observing religious fasting could somehow impede American Independence Day celebrations, or that an entire calendar month could somehow be \"moved\" to another time to accommodate a single-day event, defies rational thought. And none of this has anything to do with \"dhimmitude,\" a word discussed in a separate article on this site.) dhimmitude What's missing from these write-ups is acknowledgement that the size of Indonesia's Muslim population would, as the source article suggested, inhibit the ability of locals or visitors to participate in the embassy's celebration. The impact of Ramadan on Indonesia for non-Muslim residents, guests, visitors, and diplomats is well documented, as noted in the Lonely Planettravel guide's advice to those who plan to be in Indonesia for Ramadan to allow for its inevitable disruptions: Lonely Planet   In many places, including the UAE, Morocco, Tunisia, Indonesia and Egypt, daily life changes dramatically this month, giving visitors a chance to see a whole new side to these regions. Like any holiday, Ramadan affects business as usual and this definitely isnt the best time to attempt a whistle-stop sightseeing marathon. Many venues operate with limited hours and staff, so try to book accommodation, transport and tours before you arrive. Similarly, a poster on Stack Exchange's Travel section explained how even those not observing Ramadan are affected by it: explained   The other travel glitch to beware of is that the end of Ramadan (Eid ul-Fitr, Idulfitri, or Lebaranin Indonesian) is the local equivalent of Christmas, when everybody takes time off and goes back to their families (mudik). This means most transportation is fully booked for several days and even the traffic jams are legendary. Plan ahead so you can avoid travel at this time. Moreover, nothing about this issue was unique to Indonesia or 2015. U.S. Embassies in other countries shifted their Independence Day celebrations in previous years so as not to coincide with Ramadan  all without drawing outraged comments from bloggers: The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta held Independence Day festivities one month early (on 4 June 2015) this year due to the approach of Ramadan, but nothing indicates that decision was made under any pressure, threat, demand, coercion, or other claim \"offense\" by Muslims rather than being a simple recognition of the cultural and logistical difficulties posed by the July 4th overlap with the Muslim holy month.

        ],
        "justification": "In the spring of 2022, we received inquiries from Snopes readers about an intriguing online meme that claimed that the Catholic Church had once opposed the provision of street lighting and, specifically, that Pope Gregory XVI had banned gas lighting during the 19th century because the modern innovation \"flew in the face of God's law.\" That meme contained a kernel of truth, because a ban on gas-fueled street lighting was in place temporarily in Rome, towards the end of Gregory's time as pope, in the 1840s. However, the prohibition was based on concerns over pollution, and there was no church-wide doctrinal or theological opposition to gas lighting. As a result, the meme badly misrepresented the historical record, and we are issuing a rating of \"Mostly False.\" The meme was first published by the humor website Cracked.com, and contains the following text: The Catholic Church opposed street lights. In 1831, Pope Gregory XVI even banned gas lighting in Papal states. The church argued that God very clearly established the delineation between night and day, and putting lights up after sundown flew in the face of God's law.   Some of the same language used in that meme also appeared in a 2015 Cracked.com post entitled \"8 Hilarious Historical Fears That Seriously Delayed Progress.\" The section on street lighting read: 2015 Cracked.com post ... Then, there was the Catholic Church, who opposed street lighting on the grounds that God very clearly established the delineation between night and day, and putting lights up after sundown was like spitting right in Jesus' face, while cats chase dogs and giant wieners ladle mustard over screaming human beings. In 1831, Pope Gregory XVI went so far as to ban gas lighting in Papal states, fearing that the extra hours of visibility might enable rebellion against the church. That 2015 post contained two sources for the \"street light ban\" claim. The first was a 1983 book about Paul Cullen, the first Irish cardinal and an influential conservative figure in the Catholic church of the 19th century. The meme itself also cited this book in small type, at the bottom. 1983 book In one section of that work, author Desmond Bowen wrote about Gregory's zeal in suppressing rebellions against church rule in the Papal States (now northern Italy), and what he described as \"papal triumphalism\": \"... More ancient churches and monuments were restored, new palaces were built, and the Vatican was further enriched with valuable collections of art. At the same time the people of Rome were denied street lighting, and the pope refused to allow the coming of the railway to the city.\" As we can see, that source provided no elaboration or detail, and did not specify whether the denizens of Rome were \"denied\" street lighting for cultural reasons, supply reasons, due to their own poverty, or by law. The second source mentioned was a 2013 book entitled \"A Corrupt Tree: An Encyclopedia of Crimes Committed by the Church of Rome Against Humanity and the Human Spirit.\" Volume I of that tome presented Gregory as an ultra-conservative traditionalist who rejected progress and modernization. The book stated that: 2013 book \"Gregory even went so far as to ban steamboats and railways in the Papal States. He also banned street lights on the grounds that people might gather under them to plot against papal authority. He also refused to admit gas into the Papal States, as that would mean that the Devil had got his foot in the door.\" So far, we have two sources cited, neither of which provides a deeper source, and two purported rationales for the supposed church ban on, or opposition to, street lighting: that it went against God's law; and that the pope feared it would facilitate rebellion against his rule. In a 2016 post about the meme, Christian blogger Roger Pearse presented several relevant sources, most of which provided interesting contextual background. Those contemporary sources presented the pope, in that part of the 19th century, as a distinctly mundane political executive overseeing bureaucratic control over the poorly-run Papal States in northern Italy, as opposed to the modern-day pontiff, who tends to issue moral and philosophical guidance rather than signing off on local administrative ordinances. 2016 post In particular, that blog post points to two sources that yield the conclusion that gas-fueled street lights were temporarily forbidden under Gregory's rule, but allowed once again, especially after the election of Gregory's successor, Pope Pius IX. Firstly, an April 4, 1845 letter written by the Irish journalist Francis Sylvester Mahony to Charles Dickens. Mahony, who was living in the Eternal City at the time, bemoaned what he described as \"the efforts of government to arrest the progress of those modern improvements which must obviously ultimately be adopted even in Rome.\" April 4, 1845 letter In particular, Mahony highlighted a new regulation, posted to the walls of the city, which \"denounces the modern innovation of gas light,\" and dictates that \"all private gasworks of this nature are suppressed.\" Secondly, a March 1846 order, written by the Governor of Rome Pietro Marini, which set out detailed regulations and conditions for the use of gas-fueled street lights, effectively reversing the earlier outright ban, but raising what would now likely be described as \"public health\" concerns over the use of the lights. The title of the order read (translated from Italian): \"Provisions on gas lighting introduced in some homes, and other places in the capital with gasses installed within the town.\" March 1846 order   Based on the evidence available, we can reach the following conclusions:",

        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  During an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Barack Obama said, \"a strong government hand is needed to assure that wealth is distributed more equitably.\" \nStatus:  False.\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, July 2008] \n\n\nWell, Barack has finally decided to step up and tell us what he has in mind for us with his promises of 'change.'  Just a few short days ago, he had an interview with the Wall Street Journal to further discuss his economic plans/policies for the future and he spelled it out quite clearly.  As you can see from the excerpt quote from that interview (below), he plans on officially doing away with capitalism and replacing it with his much favored system of socialism.  Many of us already knew of his strong socialist tendencies in the past, but he has now put it out there officially on record.  It is amazing that this article, and specifically this quote, is getting overlooked, especially when he is so direct and brazen about his plans.  Every single American who works for a living should be absolutely scared spitless.   Pass this along to everyone you can. Quote from Wall Street Journal: \"a strong government hand is needed to assure that wealth is distributed more equitably.\" Barack Obama, WSJ, 6/17/08 If this doesn't scare Republicans to get out the vote, I don't know what would!!\n Origins:  This item comes from a 17 June 2008 Wall Street Journal article about Senator Barack Obama's economic plans for the U.S., some of which was based on an interview Senator Obama gave to that publication.\nnot, as claimed above, a direct quote from Senator Obama.  As the lack of quotation marks around those words in the passage below indicates, the phrase is the reporters' summary/interpretation of Obama's position, not his own words (the direct quotation portion of the sentence having ended with the word \"workers\"): article \n\nSen. Obama cited new economic forces to explain what appears like a return to an older-style big-government Democratic platform skeptical of market forces. \"Globalization and technology and automation all weaken the position of workers,\" he said, and a strong government hand is needed to assure that wealth is distributed more equitably.\n\n (The phrase \"a strong government hand is needed to assure that wealth is distributed more equitably\" also does not appear in the Wall Street Journal's transcript of Senator Obama's interview.) transcript As for whether the phrase in question is a fair summary of Senator Obama's economic philosophy (whether or not he actually uttered those words), here is what he  said during the portions of the interview apparently summarized by that phrase: \n\nI do believe the tax policies over the last eight years have been badly skewed towards the winners of the global economy. And I do think there is a function for tax policy in making sure that everybody benefits from globalization or at least the benefits and burdens are shared a little more easily. If, as some talk about, we've  got a winner-take-all economy where the highly skilled, highly educated are reaping huge rewards and the unskilled or even semi-skilled are getting a much smaller share of the economy, then our tax policies can help cushion some of the blow through providing health care. So if people lose their jobs they're not losing their health care as well. That actually makes a more flexible work force that makes workers more mobile and less resistant to change. If we've got investments in education, that will make us more competitive in the long run. We've got to pay for that like anything else. But it would be a mistake to say I view our tax code only as a distribution question. I also think that our tax code has come to distort a lot of economic decision making so I'd like to see simplification as part of an overall tax agenda. On the corporate side, for example, one of the things I've asked my folks to look at is: Are there ways we can close existing loopholes in tax havens at the same time as we're lowering overall rates? We've got this new problem: The biggest problem with our tax code when it comes to the business side is that we have one of the highest tax rates  corporate tax rates  on paper but our effective tax rate is one of the lowest ... You know, how much you pay in taxes as a corporation a lot of times is going to depend on how good your lobbyist is, as opposed to any sound economic theories. So those distorting effects I'd like to actually remove and eliminate from our tax system, but obviously that's a complicated and difficult task. The last time we did it was in 1986. We're going to have to, I think, revisit that.\n \n I say that the combination of globalization and technology and automation all weaken the position of workers. I would add an anti-union climate to that list. But all weakens the position of workers, particularly blue-collar workers, in the economy, and some of it is just historical. You know after World War II,\nwe were in this unique position where Europe was decimated, Japan was decimated. China was off the grid because of Mao. And so we didn't have a lot of competition out there, and now other countries are rising and automation has supplanted a lot of work that used to be done by middle-class workers. We have drastically increased productivity since 1995, and there was the theory that if you increase productivity enough some of these problems of living standards would solve themselves. But what we've seen is rising productivity, rising corporate profits but flat-lining or even declining wages and incomes for the average family. What that says is that it's going to be important for us to pay attention to not only growing the pie, which is always critical, but also some attention to how it is sliced. I do not believe that those two things  fair distribution and robust economic growth  are mutually exclusive. You get to a point, I think, if you have a participatory income tax, for example, where you might be discouraging work because marginal rates are so high. You might undoubtedly get to a point where the capital gain and dividend taxes are so high that they distort investment decisions and you're weaker economically. But you know if you've got a sensible policy that says, we're going to capture some of the nation's economic growth ... and reinvest it in things we know have to be done, like science and technology research or fixing our energy policy, and then that is actually going to be a spur to productivity and not an inhibitor.\n Last updated:  17 August 2008\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   Davis, Bob and Amy Chozicks.  \"Obama Plans Spending Boost, Possible Cut in Business Tax.\"\n   The Wall Street Journal.  17 June 2008  (P.

            "Despite Internet outrage saying otherwise, New Mexico \"compound\" defendant Siraj Ibn Wahhaj has not been released on bond, because he is being held on an out-of-state warrant."
        ],
        "justification": "Beginning on 13 August 2018, social media outrage erupted over news reports that a New Mexico judge was allowing release on bond for defendants accused of abusing children at a squalid \"compound\" near the Colorado border. Most of the outrage centered on a smiling photograph of Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, who has been the focus of sensational reports that he allegedly trained a child at the compound to carry out school shootings: reports   Wahhaj is one of five defendants in a group that include his sisters Hujrah, 37, and Subhannah, 35; his wife Jany Leveille, 35; and Lucas Morton, 40; who are charged with 11 counts of child abuse stemming from neglect. Wahhaj additionally faces a count originating from Clayton County, Georgia, of custodial interference. All five were arrested in a 4 August 2018 SWAT raid on what the news media has termed a \"compound\" in an unincorporated New Mexico community called Amalia. Authorities also discovered the body of a small child believed to be Wahhaj's son on the grounds, but the cause of death has not yet been determined. The case involves a number of combustible aspects that have lent it extreme notoriety, including potential murder, abuse of children, religion, and race -- all the defendants are Muslim and African-American (except for Leveille, who is is a Haitian national). Lurid accounts of supernatural religious \"rituals\" taking place at the compound and accusations that Wahhaj was training a child in weapons and tactics to carry out a future school shooting have also been reported. rituals training Prosecutors in the case filed a motion for all five defendants to be held in pretrial custody, but when Eighth Judicial District court Judge Sarah Backus (who is an elected Democrat) denied their request, the Internet went collectively ballistic. Facebook and Twitter users shared memes and posted messages featuring Siraj Ibn Wahhaj's image and raging that he would be released despite being a \"Muslim extremist\" who may have killed his child and trained children to shoot up schools: Democrat Facebook Twitter  New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez weighed in with a statement saying the \"dangerous accused criminals in the Taos compound case should never have been released on bail yesterday.\" (A spokesman for Martinez didn't respond to our request for comment.) statement Backus and the Taos County courthouse received death threats, prompting authorities to place the building on lockdown on 14 August 2018. New Mexico State Police are investigating the continuing death threats, said Barry Massey, spokesman for the Administrative Office of the Courts. Siraj Ibn Wahhaj's defense attorney, Tom Clark, told us content being posted about the defendants amounts to hate speech. \"It's really hard when the court of public opinion has already spoken,\" he told us by phone. \"They're black Muslims accused of vague allegations of terror. Were supposed to have moved beyond public lynchings but thats what these people on the Internet are calling for.\" The fury, however intense and self-righteous, didn't take into account the reality of the case. Backus's order, filed 14 August 2018, states that Siraj Ibn Wahhaj \"is held on a detainer from Georgia and will not be released.\" Leveille will also not be released on bond, as her custody was transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on 14 August 2018. According to immigration authorities, she has been living unlawfully in the United States for more than 20 years after overstaying a visitor's visa. We called the Taos County Adult Detention Center where all five defendants are being held, and we were told that as of mid-afternoon on 15 August 2018, none of the remaining three defendants had yet bonded out. If any of those defendants are to be released, they must first post a $20,000 signature bond and will remain under house arrest, according to the judge's order. They will be fitted with electronic monitoring devices which they must wear around the clock and will be prohibited from leaving Taos County without permission from the court. They must meet weekly with attorneys, attend all scheduled court appearances, and may not possess firearms or deadly weapons. They are barred from having contact with the children, who are in protective custody, without supervision from child protective services. Because New Mexico voters and state legislature passed pretrial release and detention reform in 2016, Backus was limited in her leeway when deciding whether to grant bond. According to the amendment to the state constitution, judges can deny bail if a defendant poses a danger to the public or a flight risk, but the burden is on prosecutors to provide \"clear and convincing evidence\" that such is the case. Bail can only be denied in cases involving capital crimes, or when \"no release conditions will reasonably ensure the appearance of the person [in court] as required or protect the safety of any other person or the community.\" Defendants cannot be held simply because they can't afford the bail amount. reform According her order turning down the prosecution's motion to deny bond, Backus said prosecutors didn't provide \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the defendants other than Siraj Ibn Wahhaj (who would not be released in any case) needed to be held in detention because they were dangerous, or that no conditions of release would ensure the safety of the community. \"It is an extremely high standard of proof and the State has failed to meet this standard,\" she wrote. The order also noted that none of the defendants were charged in the death of the child or any crimes related to firearms. They also haven't been charged with making terrorist threats, and the state didn't produce evidence they were hatching a substantive terrorism plan. Backus criticized prosecutors for asking the court to rely on media reports and \"conjecture and assumption\" to piece together evidence the defendants were sufficiently dangerous. \"From this meager evidence the court is requested by the state to surmise that these people are dangerous terrorists with a plot against the country or institutions. The court may not surmise, guess or assume,\" she wrote. Siraj Ibn Wahhaj is accused of taking his 3-year-old son, Abdul-ghani, away from his mother in Clayton County, Georgia, in December 2017. The child was diagnosed a severe condition known as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy that left him unable to walk, prone to seizures, and in need of constant care. Wahhaj told his wife before allegedly absconding with the boy that he wanted to perform an exorcism because he believed the child to be possessed by the devil, according to court documents. The allegation that Wahhaj trained a child to commit a school shooting was made by a foster parent caring for one of the children taken from the compound, according to court documents, but Backus's order notes that prosecutors didn't offer any evidence to support that assertion. (Von Chelet Leveille, brother of Jany, maintained that the two older children asked to be taught to shoot and that the family's use of firearms was legal and innocent.) Claims of religious \"rituals\" were also made by prosecutor's during the Monday pretrial detention hearing, but Backus's order stated that no evidence beyond the defendants' praying over the deceased child had been presented to support those claims. A preliminary hearing will be held within 60 days to determine if sufficient evidence exists to make the defendants stand trial.

            "Conspiracy-pushing blogs seized on a  Slovenian \"report\" and conflated separate refugee aid programs."
        ],
        "justification": "In November 2018, various conspiracy-pushing web sites glommed onto a dubious post emanating from Europe to gin up hysteria about both refugees and the United Nations. The original story, published on the right-wing Slovenian website Nova24TV, \"revealed\" that immigrants were spotted in Bosnia and Herzegovina using MasterCard debit cards and included an accusation sourced to an anonymous \"local police officer\": Migrants who are caught and sent back, in a few days or weeks again try to illegally enter Croatia. Some of them are really poor, but many of them are well-equipped: they have new footwear, new clothes, sophisticated smartphones, and some also have MasterCards with no names, just numbers. The cards can be used to withdraw money from ATMs, but we do not know who funds them. The story also included a stock photograph of young black men who had no relationship to the events described in the article, alongside the caption \"The image is symbolic\":   The \"report\" was soon picked up by equally dubious websites, some of which included the same image without mentioning that it was a stock photo used only for \"symbolic\" purposes: Now the mystery has been solved regarding how so many poor migrants have been able to fund their illegal journeys to Europe. The UN, EU and Soros, in partnership with MasterCard, have spent hundreds of millions of dollars providing migrants with prepaid debit cards -- and European tax payers have not been informed that their taxes are being spent on handouts to illegal immigrants.   What those sites did do, however, was expand on the original story by employing a familiar anti-Semitic dog whistle and attempting to tie the claim to liberal billionaire George Soros by falsely citing Nova24TV's piece -- even though it did not mention him -- and saying that the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) was working \"in cooperation\" with Soros. familiar In reality, these posts conflated an existing United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) program with a separate humanitarian partnership involving Soros and the credit card provider MasterCard. The UNCHR's program was launched in Moldova in 2011 and expanded in 2016. That program provided aid to 10.5 million people across 94 countries between 2016 and August 2018, with recipients accessing their money via cash machines or \"mobile money\" electronic payments distributed through specialized cell phones: launched expanded Vulnerable persons fleeing persecution and seeking asylum in Moldova can now use debit cards under a new UNHCR initiative to expedite the distribution of the agencys monthly subsistence allowances. Moldova is the first country in Europe where the UN refugee agency has implemented the debit card scheme to streamline the distribution of its monthly financial support via Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). The new card scheme was launched by UNHCR, in cooperation with BCR Chisinau S.A. It enables needy refugees, asylum seekers and beneficiaries of humanitarian protection to receive convenient debit cards which they can use to withdraw the monthly support. UNHCR is very pleased to launch this initiative in Moldova as it enables people to withdraw funds at nearby bankomats at their convenience rather than having to commute to a central distribution point to collect the allowance, said Peter Kessler, UNHCRs representative in Moldova. Refugees have often suffered indignities and find it difficult to integrate in a new, safe host country, he added. Having these cards is another step towards helping them more actively participate in daily life and maintain a greater degree of dignity. The sums being distributed to beneficiaries of the UNHCR initiative are modest, currently not more than 500-600 Moldovan leu (30-36 euros) per person each month. Experienced aid workers -- including staff of the Ministry of Interiors Refugee Directorate, UNHCR and its implementing partners -- meet regularly to review applications for assistance. Recipients of the cards were pleased to get bankomat access and avoid having to pay for city buses to go and collect their monthly support. Asylum-seekers only receive social support for six months under the UN scheme while they await their decisions. However, refugees and beneficiaries of humanitarian protection may be assisted for longer periods if they are sick, are persons with disabilities or are elderly or unemployed. One of the most important benefits is that the debit cards will also give the recipients access to bank accounts, where they may eventually save money and earn interest. The UNCHR initiative was unrelated to either of two similar separate MasterCard-sponsored aid programs. The first, a June 2016 partnership between the credit card company, the Serbian Ministry of Labor, and the humanitarian group the Mercy Corps, sought to provide prepaid debit cards to refugees to help meet basic needs: partnership humanitarian The global organization Mercy Corps launched the pilot program in partnership with MasterCard and the Serbian Ministry of Labor to distribute prepaid debit cards to eligible refugees traveling through Serbia. Families received cards with a value of about $235 (210 Euros), and individuals approximately $78 (70 Euros). The money could be used to make purchases that help meet immediate needs. It was the first such program in the region to use an international cashless payment mechanism to help the tens of thousands of refugees and migrants seeking haven in Europe. By leveraging our technologies and products such as MasterCard Aid Network and Prepaid, MasterCard collaborates with partners to provide essential services at the most critical times of refugees lives. To date, MasterCard Aid and Prepaid cards have been deployed in humanitarian responses across Africa, Asia and Europe  in countries such as Turkey, Kenya, Yemen, Nepal, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Niger, the Philippines, and Greece  and are on-track to support thousands of beneficiaries ... we are working with Mercy Corps to provide assistance to thousands of refugees in Europe to cover their basic needs and allow them to live with dignity during one of most difficult times in their lives. A separate partnership between MasterCard and Soros to launch a \"standalone entity,\" Humanity Ventures, was first announced in January 2017. That program sought to provide private sector solutions to social issues such as joblessness, lack of access to healthcare, inadequate education, and financial exclusion among migrants and their host communities: announced Operating as a standalone entity, Humanity Ventures would initially combine solutions designed to expand access to healthcare and education, foster local economic development and entrepreneurship, and enhance the delivery of aid. One such solution is the Mastercard Aid Network, an award winning digital voucher platform designed in partnership with humanitarian organizations. With the creation of Humanity Ventures, Soros could invest up to $50 million to make these solutions even more scalable and sustainable. The social enterprise could also serve as an incubator and accelerator for smaller projects committed to mitigating the migration crisis. Designed to combine the need for business returns with social impact, Humanity Ventures would also act as a new model for how civil society, governments, and the private sector improve quality of life and drive economic growth. Migrants are often forced into lives of despair in their host communities because they cannot gain access to financial, healthcare and government services. Our potential investment in this social enterprise, coupled with Mastercards ability to create products that serve vulnerable communities, can show how private capital can play a constructive role in solving social problems, said George Soros. Humanity Ventures is intended to be profitable so as to stimulate involvement from other businesspeople. We also hope to establish standards of practice to ensure that investments are not exploitative of the vulnerable communities we intend to serve. The UNCHR has been involved with a program to provide cash to refugees via debit cards to help meet immediate needs, and George Soros has been involved with a program to assist migrants in partnership with MasterCard, but Soros is not funding the distribution of MasterCard debit cards to refugees via the United Nations.

            "Honeymooning couple's sexual activities are secretly videotaped by their hotel."
        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  A couple who return to the hotel where they honeymooned are shocked to discover their wedding night activities were videotaped and made available to other guests. LEGEND Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 1993] \nA newlywed couple on their honeymoon checks into a hotel in the Poconos and stays in the Honeymoon Suite.  They have a great time, and decide to come back on their first anniversary.  When they check in on their anniversary, they are given an option to rent adult movies to view in the room.  So they decide to rent a movie.  When they retire to the room and put the movie on, they discover  to their horror  that the movie shows THEM having sex on their honeymoon, having been filmed by a hidden camera.  Law suits and settlements follow ...\n\n   Origins:  What could be a more painfully embarrassing and shocking violation of your privacy than discovering someone had been watching you (without your consent or knowledge) while you were   engaged in the deeply personal and intimate act of making love with your partner?   How about finding out that someone had secretly made a video tape of the event  one that had been distributed to countless others for their viewing pleasure?  Such is the premise of this legend. Tales of peepholes set up to allow the furtive observance of people's private activities in bathrooms and hotel rooms  and lawsuits resulting from them  have been circulating for years, many of them based on real incidents.  In one of the most prominent examples, an Iowa couple who celebrated their engagement night with a private evening in a penthouse suite at the Canterbury Inn in Coralville, Iowa, in 1988 sued the hotel after discovering a peephole behind a two-way mirror  a peephole that  gave someone a view into their suite that night.  They won their invasion of privacy lawsuit to the tune of $4.3 million in punitive and compensatory damages (although they eventually settled for $1 million, the limit of the hotel's insurance coverage). The Canterbury Inn case involved no cameras, but with the advent of home video equipment has grown progressively cheaper, smaller, and better in quality, the creation of a legend (real or not)  like the example quoted above was inevitable.  That version's setting of the Poconos (\"the honeymoon capital of the world\") is an obvious one, for the  Pennsylvania Poconos feature no less than eight resorts that cater to couples by offering a variety of romantic facilities.  Moreover, it was at a Cove Haven, a small hotel on a lake in the Poconos, where Morris Wilkins invented and installed the world's first heart-shaped bathtub in 1963.   What makes this legend particularly interesting from a folkloric standpoint is its age  tales of secretly-filmed sexual encounters antedate the development of the home video market by several decades.  In these older versions, however, the victims are not sweethearts or married couples innocently engaged in private lovemaking (as in the example above), but characters such as adulterers or bawdy house patrons who are being punished for having transgressed the sexual mores of their times.  The following version, for example, comes from a 1927 humor collection: \n\nA gentleman from Idaho was in Paris and didn't want to make himself too conspicuous. So he asked a cabby to give him the address of a good whorehouse. He  went there by himself, quietly, asked for a private room, and, after selecting his partner, ordered dinner with lots of wine. After the meal the man entertained himself in various ways with his playmate, who taught him positions of which even Elephantis, Aretino and Luisa Sigea were ignorant. Thoroughly drained, the gentleman from Idaho went downstairs, where he asked the madam what his bill was.  \"There is no charge,\" said the lady of the house.  Astonished, but not disposed to argue the matter, her guest left. All next day he hugged his secret to himself. He could barely wait till dinner time before he again presented himself before the bawds. Again he went through his performance, but this time, when he made a bluff at paying the piper he was informed the charges were seven hundred francs.  \"What! \" he shrieked. \"Wasn't I here last evening, and didn't I go through every kind of screw, and you didn't charge me a sou?\"  \"Ah,\" said the madam, \"but last night was for the movies.\"\n What's even more remarkable is that a tale with all the same elements of this legend (lovers clandestinely filmed by an outsider, the results displayed to others, the principals' finding out through an inadvertent viewing of the film) date to the very earliest days of motion pictures.  Consider this description of the 1903 film, The Story the Biograph Told: The Story the Biograph Told \n\nThe film opens in a business office, where a man is explaining the operation of a movie camera to an office boy. The boss and an attractive female secretary then enter his office and begin embracing, while, unbeknownst to them, the boy cranks the camera. The scene shifts to a theater, where the boss and his wife are watching a movie, when inexplicably the intimate office encounter is thrown on the screen.  The next day, the incensed wife marches into the office, discharges the secretary, and replaces her with a man.\n\n A variation on the same theme  the movies' ability to place people in compromising situations for the amusement of an audience  is echoed in a related legend about a couple's accidentally returning a sexy tape of themselves to a video store.   As the proliferation in recent years of amateur sexual videos and live performances via webcams has demonstrated, though, more than a few of us are quite willing to amuse audiences by sharing our intimacies with them.    tape Sightings:  The plot of the infamous (and originally unaired) episode of the Fox TV series Married with Children (\"I'll See You in Court\") involves Al and Peg making a trip to the seedy Hop-on Inn for a romantic interlude and discovering the porn video in their room is actually a tape the motel secretly made of their neighbors, Steve and Marcy. episode Last updated:  15 March 2014\n    Brunvand, Jan Harold.

The full message can be viewed here and below, but the poster claimed to be mourning the death of his 7-year-old son Lachlan, who he said had died from a \"massive heart attack\" caused by his having received a COVID-19 vaccine.  here (In the Australian state of New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital and largest city, COVID-19 vaccination became available to children ages 5 to 11 in January 2022).  became available to children ages 5 to 11 In the post, Leary stated that his son had become sick and suffered a fever on the night of \"Wednesday\" (understood to be Jan. 12), before his parents brought him to \"Westmead Hospital\" the following morning, from which he was purportedly discharged several hours later. Leary claimed that on Friday morning (understood to be Jan. 14), his son collapsed at home and stopped breathing. An ambulance came within seven minutes, but according to Leary, he died in transit, having suffered a \"massive heart attack.\" The poster clearly attributed the boy's death to a COVID-19 vaccination, writing that he had \"lost [his] son Lachlan...to the vaccine.\"   Screenshots of that post were shared widely, particularly among online vaccine skeptics and conspiracy theorists, in the days after Jan. 15. However, even those aligned with the anti-vaccine sentiment expressed in the post were unable to find solid evidence to support its authenticity, as was Snopes. aligned unable find The \"Steve Leary\" Facebook account behind the post was either deactivated, deleted, or suspended by Jan. 18, so it was not possible to gather details that might, in principle, corroborate the anecdote provided. Furthermore, we could not find any record of a Steve or Steven/Stephen Leary living in New South Wales with a son named Lachlan and daughter named Sammy (the latter mentioned in the post). The post did not specify the first name of Leary's wife, so this potential verification method was also not available.  No reputable Australian news outlet has reported on the death of a young child in New South Wales due to a vaccine-induced heart attack in January 2022, but rather the Facebook post was regurgitated by conspicuously unreliable websites, many of them based outside Australia, one of which even added the laughable embellishment that Leary was \"Australia's prime minister.\" unreliable websites based outside laughable embellishment Snopes could find no obituary for any boy named Lachlan matching the description above, and funeral details were not publicly available. Nobody has produced any photographs of the boy  typically a mainstay of social media posts about the tragic death of a young child.  Although not definitive, the specific, local policy context surrounding the post also tended to arouse skepticism. In January 2022, the government of New South Wales extended the availability of COVID-19 vaccination to children between the ages of 5 and 11, prompting high-profile but unfounded claims of child mortality, in what appeared to be a deliberate effort to discourage Australian parents from having their children vaccinated. extended the availability of COVID-19 vaccination unfounded claims While most of the details included in the post yielded no supportive evidence  the name of the boy, his sister and his father, the date of his death, and so on  one factual claim allowed for a vigorous refutation of the authenticity of the entire story: the name of the hospital where Lachlan Leary was supposedly treated. Among several other duties and functions, the New South Wales Ministry of Health oversees a network of public hospitals in that state, including in the Western Sydney suburb of Westmead. If any 7-year-old child were brought to Westmead Hospital by ambulance, the youth would be treated at the adjacent children's hospital. adjacent children's hospital On Facebook, the Children's Hospital at Westmead strongly refuted the claims in \"Steve Leary's\" post, writing: \"There are many inaccurate posts currently circulating on social media. There is no record of any child having passed away following COVID vaccination at our hospital\": strongly refuted   In response to a detailed inquiry from Snopes, a spokesperson for Westmead Hospital wrote: \"As Westmead Hospital is not a paediatric hospital, we did not treat any children with those symptoms in the time period indicated.\" The hospital spokesperson also forwarded the following statement from the New South Wales Ministry of Health: \"NSW Health has not been able to locate any record of any such incident.\" In summary: the hospital at Westmead; the children's hospital at Westmead; and the government ministry that oversees the entire public hospital system for the state of New South Wales have each publicly refuted the authenticity of the incident described in that viral Facebook post in January 2022.  Those official, on-the-record refutations, combined with the total absence of corroborating evidence, and the presence of several misinformation \"red flags,\" are enough to warrant a conclusion that the \"Lachlan Leary\" story  a 7-year-old boy killed by a vaccine-induced heart attack near Sydney in January 2022  was false.

        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Letter of resignation submitted to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell by a U.S. diplomat.  \nStatus:  True.\n Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2003] \n\n\nU.S. Diplomat's Letter of Resignation  Dear Mr. Secretary:  I am writing you to submit my resignation from the Foreign Service of the United States and from my position as Political Counselor in U.S. Embassy Athens, effective March 7. I do so with a heavy heart. The baggage of my upbringing included a felt obligation to give something back to my country. Service as a U.S. diplomat was a dream job. I was paid to understand foreign languages and cultures, to seek out diplomats, politicians, scholars and journalists, and to persuade them that U.S. interests and theirs fundamentally coincided. My faith in my country and its values was the most powerful weapon in my diplomatic arsenal.  It is inevitable that during twenty years with the State Department I would become more sophisticated and cynical about the narrow and selfish bureaucratic motives that sometimes shaped our policies. Human nature is what it is, and I was rewarded and promoted for understanding human nature. But until this Administration it had been possible to believe that by upholding the policies of my president I was also upholding the interests of the American people and the world. I believe it no longer.  The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible not only with American values but also with American interests. Our fervent pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us to squander the international legitimacy that has been Americas most potent weapon of both offense and defense since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle the largest and most effective web of international relationships the world has ever known. Our current course will bring instability and danger, not security.  The sacrifice of global interests to domestic politics and to bureaucratic self-interest is nothing new, and it is certainly not a uniquely American problem. Still, we have not seen such systematic distortion of intelligence, such systematic manipulation of American opinion, since the war in Vietnam. The September 11 tragedy left us stronger than before, rallying around us a vast international coalition to cooperate for the first time in a systematic way against the threat of terrorism. But rather than take credit for those successes and build on them, this Administration has chosen to make terrorism a domestic political tool, enlisting a scattered and largely defeated Al Qaeda as its bureaucratic ally. We spread disproportionate terror and confusion in the public mind, arbitrarily linking the unrelated problems of terrorism and Iraq. The result, and perhaps the motive, is to justify a vast misallocation of shrinking public wealth to the military and to weaken the safeguards that protect American citizens from the heavy hand of government. September 11 did not do as much damage to the fabric of American society as we seem determined to so to ourselves. Is the Russia of the late Romanovs really our model, a selfish, superstitious empire thrashing toward self-destruction in the name of a doomed status quo?  We should ask ourselves why we have failed to persuade more of the world that a war with Iraq is necessary. We have over the past two years done too much to assert to our world partners that narrow and mercenary U.S. interests override the cherished values of our partners. Even where our aims were not in question, our consistency is at issue. The model of Afghanistan is little comfort to allies wondering on what basis we plan to rebuild the Middle East, and in whose image and interests. Have we indeed become blind, as Russia is blind in Chechnya, as Israel is blind in the Occupied Territories, to our own advice, that overwhelming military power is not the answer to terrorism? After the shambles of post-war Iraq joins the shambles in Grozny and Ramallah, it will be a brave foreigner who forms ranks with Micronesia to follow where we lead.  We have a coalition still, a good one. The loyalty of many of our friends is impressive, a tribute to American moral capital built up over a century. But our closest allies are persuaded less that war is justified than that it would be perilous to allow the U.S. to drift into complete solipsism. Loyalty should be reciprocal. Why does our President condone the swaggering and contemptuous approach to our friends and allies this Administration is fostering, including among its most senior officials. Has \"oderint dum metuant\" really become our motto?  I urge you to listen to Americas friends around the world. Even here in Greece, purported hotbed of European anti-Americanism, we have more and closer friends than the American newspaper reader can possibly imagine. Even when they complain about American arrogance, Greeks know that the world is a difficult and dangerous place, and they want a strong international system, with the U.S. and EU in close partnership. When our friends are afraid of us rather than for us, it is time to worry. And now they are afraid. Who will tell them convincingly that the United States is as it was, a beacon of liberty, security, and justice for the planet?  Mr. Secretary, I have enormous respect for your character and ability. You have preserved more international credibility for us than our policy deserves, and salvaged something positive from the excesses of an ideological and self-serving Administration. But your loyalty to the President goes too far. We are straining beyond its limits an international system we built with such toil and treasure, a web of laws, treaties, organizations, and shared values that sets limits on our foes far more effectively than it ever constrained Americas ability to defend its interests.  I am resigning because I have tried and failed to reconcile my conscience with my ability to represent the current U.S. Administration. I have confidence that our democratic process is ultimately self-correcting, and hope that in a small way I can contribute from outside to shaping policies that better serve the security and prosperity of the American people and the world we share.\n Origins:  The letter of resignation quoted above was indeed submitted to U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell by John Brady Kiesling, a career diplomat who has served the United States at embassies from Israel to Morocco to Armenia.  Mr. Kiesling resigned, in large part, because of his disagreement with the Bush administration's policy towards Iraq, and his letter of resignation was made public when it was published in the 27 February 2003 edition of The New York Times. published For those of you who read through the whole letter and are puzzling over the phrase oderint dum metuant, it's Latin for \"Let them hate us, so long as they fear us,\" claimed to have been a favorite saying of the Roman emperor Caligula.

            "We were unable to substantiate a claim that Donald Trump was denied a license by the Nevada Gaming Commission because he was not \"trustworthy.\""
        ],
        "justification": "Donald Trump thepolitician was a relatively newpersonality in 2016, as many people had already known him for years asa real estate mogul and reality televisionstar. His longtime presence in American pop culture made him an especially rich source of urban legends, misinformation, and memes. In February 2016, the above-reproduced an image-based rumor claimed that Trump's Las Vegas hotel lacked a casino because the Nevada Gaming Commission had deemed Trump not \"trustworthy\" enough to qualify for one:  We located one possible source for the claim in a 23 February 1987New York Timesarticle.According to piece, which was nearly 30 years old, Trump had difficulty in the 1980s withattempts to expand his empire west: article Last September Mr. Trump bought a 4.9 percent stake in the Holiday Corporation, which operates casinos in Atlantic City and Nevada. He sold the stake at a $35 million profit in November and bought into Bally. Mr. Trump recently applied for a Nevada casino license, but Paul Bible, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission at the time, said that Nevada regulators would look askance at any ''greenmailer'' who hurts casino companies operating in Nevada by acquiring large quantities of stock in order to sell the stake back to the company at a premium. Mr. Trump's sale of the Holiday shares was on the open market, after takeover rumors boosted the market price. In court papers filed for the Camden hearing, Mr. Trump's lawyers denied that their client had invested in Bally for the purpose of selling to the company at a premium. ''Mr. Trump has never been, and is not presently, a greenmailer or corporate raider,'' his counterclaim said. Seventeen years later, Trump's activity in Vegas again made headlines. A February2004Las Vegas Review-Journalarticleincluded information about the Nevada Gaming Commission's view of Trump at the time: article Trump and his companies, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc. and the THCR Holding Corp., were required to be licensed by gaming regulators in Nevada after he purchased 358,000 shares of Riviera parent Riviera Holdings Corp. The purchase, made [in or around early 2003], put [Trump]over a threshold requiring investigation and licensure by Nevada gaming regulators. Trump and the other officers of his companies will appear at the Gaming Commission meeting in the capital on Feb. 19 for final approval. Gaming Control Board Chairman Dennis Neilander said the investigations of Trump and his executive team gave the board no need to ask any personal questions at the hearing. He called the applications \"very clean\" and said he was impressed with the backgrounds of some of Trump's personnel. Members of the control board asked Trump and his executives about problems with minors gaining entry to his New Jersey properties, but Chief Operating Officer Mark Brown said the company is making every effort to control the problem. Trump has talked for years about moving into the Las Vegas casino industry, but his expected licensing by the end of the month will make it much easier to put deals together. Laterthat month,the Associated Press reported that Trump was approved by Nevada state regulators to hold a stake in the Riviera hotel and casino: reported The Gaming Commission approved Trump and companies that he controls as part of a registration and suitability-finding process that would speed up any actual casino licensing in the future. Repeating his Feb. 4 comments to the commission's investigative arm, the Gaming Control Board, Trump said \"it's an honor to be here.\" He said he had lost many deals in previous years because of a state licensing process that can take more than a year. Trump paid about $2 million for shares in Riviera Holdings Corp. That put him barely over a 10 percent threshold subjecting investors to investigation and licensure by casino regulators ...The move was designed to start the state licensing process, Trump said, adding that he has little contact with Riviera executives and doesn't intend to expand on his involvement with the property. Asked about his building plans, Trump said he favors a project such as his Trump towers in Manhattan, Chicago and elsewhere. There's \"not a great chance\" that it would include New Frontier owner Phil Ruffin of Las Vegas, he added. Trump's television career and presidential bid probablydisrupted any potential ventures in Nevada between 2004 and 2016, but on 25 February 2016, anarticlein theWall Street Journalspeculated thatTrumpwasrevisitingpossibilities in Vegas: article Las Vegas casino owner Phil Ruffin said in an interview this week that he is hoping to build a casino with Mr. Trump next to the luxury high-rise Trump Hotel, which the two co-own on the Strip. He said the plans are still very preliminary, but he expects to accelerate them this year, and the Trump Organization would be a 50% owner. There are still no architectural renderings, land surveys or other concrete proposals, he added... [Son Eric]Trump said in an interview that various possible expansion plans have been discussed, including the casino and a new convention space. Nothing has been solidified, he said, adding that the family is focused on other matters including the elder Mr. Trumps presidential campaign and developing hotels elsewhere. The proposed casino would be on a four-acre parcel next to the Trump Hotel, which Mr. Ruffin and Donald Trump opened in 2008 on land that Mr. Ruffin owned. The site is currently a parking lot for the hotel; Mr. Ruffin said the casino would be connected to the existing hotel ...Mr. Ruffin said that he is now contemplating a $100 million casino, with the Trumps as 50% partners. ...Mr. Ruffin said it is unclear if Mr. Trump or his family members would need to undergo the rigorous process of securing a license from the Nevada Gaming Control Board ...Mr. Trump owned casinos in Atlantic City for decades but never had any gambling interests in Nevada. We were unable to locate any information to substantiate the claim that Trump was ever denied a gaming license or that his Las Vegas hotel was originally planned as a casino. It was true Trump engaged in legal battles in the 1980s aroundbuying casino stock. But in 2004, Trump was approved for the initial stages of casino-based development, and there was no indication he was everdeclined a Nevada Gaming Commission license based on whether he was \"trustworthy.\" On 2 March 2016, the Nevada Gaming Commission replied to our inquiry, stating that \"Donald Trump was licensed by the Nevada Gaming Commission in February 2004.\"",

        "justification": "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is particularly well-known outside of the U.S. for his past pronouncements and policies on LGBT rights, and the presence of the conservative Christian former congressman prompted protests in Ireland and Iceland during his visits to those countries in September 2019. policies Ireland Iceland According to one viral tweet, opposition to Pence's visit to Iceland was such that many local companies in the capital city, Reykjavk, conspicuously raised LGBT rainbow flags as a gesture of protest. On Sept. 4, the day of Pence's visit to Reykjavk, the Icelandic-American drag queen Heklina posted two photographs of a row of rainbow flags, along with the following message: \"Heres a great example of why Im proud to be from Iceland. Mike Pence is visiting the country and everyone is outraged. Mayor of Reykjavik, all the biggest firms and companies, everyone, theyre all flying the gay flag. All Pence will see everywhere on his visit is gay gay gay.\" Heres a great example of why Im proud to be from Iceland ??Mike Pence is visiting the country and everyone is outraged. Mayor of Reykjavik, all the biggest firms and companies, everyone, theyre all flying the gay flag. All Pence will see everywhere on his visit is gay gay gay. pic.twitter.com/XemgBk7TjU pic.twitter.com/XemgBk7TjU  Heklina (@Heklina) September 4, 2019 September 4, 2019   That widely shared tweet was further promulgated when the left-leaning Facebook page Occupy Democrats shared a screenshot of it the next day:  We received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of Heklina's claims and the authenticity and provenance of the photographs she included in her tweet. Heklina's description of the flag phenomenon was somewhat exaggerated, perhaps for rhetorical effect. But Pence's visit to Reykjavk was marked by an unusually widespread initiative to fly the LGBT rainbow flag among businesses, government buildings, and other entities in the city, especially those located close to a building where Pence held meetings with local officials. The two photographs Heklina included in her tweet were authentic. The one on the left was taken by Isold Uggadottir and shows a row of rainbow flags erected by the IT company Advania outside its building on Gurnartn in Reykjavk:  The location was highly significant because the white building visible in the background, across the street from Advania, is Hfi House, a historic Reykjavk landmark and the location where Pence met with Iceland's president Guni Th. Jhannesson on Sept. 4:  The photograph on the right in Heklina's tweet was also authentic and showed the same set of flags outside Advania's building. It appears to have been taken from an article published on the website of the Icelandic magazine Mannlf. article A spokesperson for Advania confirmed in an email to Snopes that the company had erected the rainbow flags around 11.30 a.m. on the day of Pence's visit, adding, \"We felt it was a good day to celebrate diversity.\" However, the spokesperson declined to either refute or confirm the widely held understanding that the flags were flown specifically in response to Pence's visit or intended as a gesture of protest against his past pronouncements on LGBT rights. The rainbow flags were not taken down immediately after the vice president's meeting across the street, and as of Sept. 6 they were still in place, according to the spokesperson. Several other local businesses and even some official government buildings, especially in the neighborhood surrounding Hfi House, also erected rainbow flags -- or allowed them to be erected -- during Pence's visit. Some entities did this on their own initiative, but others were encouraged to do so by Ttla Smundsdttir, an LGBT activist, and Katrn Oddsdttir, a prominent Icelandic human-rights lawyer. They distributed rainbow flags to several buildings on the day of Pence's visit, in an effort to form what Smundsdttir described to Snopes as a \"rainbow circle\" around the location of Pence's meeting with the president of Iceland. The following is an incomplete list of the entities that flew rainbow flags in Reykjavk during Pence's visit on Sept. 4: VS Rgjf, an engineering firm located across the street from Hfi House.  slenska Hamborgarafabrikkan, a hamburger restaurant located across the street from Hfi House.  Reykjavk Service Center (12-14 Borgartn), an official municipal building located down the street from Hfi House.

On Facebook, the church wrote \"Love is love\":  BSRB, a public sector employees union, located around half a mile south west of Hfi House.    Rhs Reykjavkur (Reykjavk City Hall), located around one mile west of Hfi House.    According to Smundsdttir, the following entities also erected rainbow flags to mark Pence's visit, though we haven't yet found photographic evidence to corroborate these particular claims: Handprjnasambandi (a craft store and handknitting association), and Kaffitr (a caf). The participation of City Hall could be what Heklina was alluding to when she claimed that the mayor of Reykjavk had flown the rainbow flag. Mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson himself later retweeted Heklina's claims, but a spokesperson for City Hall told Snopes in an email that Eggertsson did not personally order the flags to be flown, though the spokesperson added \"I am sure he had nothing against it.\" Rather, the decision to erect LGBT rainbow flags outside City Hall was taken by \"officials and city staff,\" the spokesperson told us.  retweeted We didn't find evidence that \"all the biggest firms and companies, everyone\" in Iceland had flown rainbow flags to protest Pence's visit there in September 2019, as Heklina wrote in her tweet. That appears to have been an exaggeration, perhaps for rhetorical effect. However, we did find evidence of a remarkable initiative among several entities in Reykjavk including City Hall, businesses, municipal and government buildings, and a church  to mark Pence's visit in that way. Given that this effort was particularly concentrated around Hfi House, where Pence held meetings on Sept. 4, it is reasonable to imagine that the visual effect of the flags would have been quite striking to the vice president as he entered and exited that neighborhood. The fact that Reykjavk City Hall, a second official municipal building and an Icelandic government agency all joined in forming the \"rainbow circle\" is especially noteworthy.

The legislation also boosted funding for unemployment benefits, set aside billions of dollars for loans to help small businesses, and increased health care spending by $100 billion, among other provisions. $1,200 checks But the bill included an additional benefit for wealthy Americans, per national media headlines in mid-April: Over 43,000 U.S. Millionaires will get stimulus averaging $1.6 million each\" (New York Post) and \"How Some Rich Americans Are Getting Checks Averaging $1.7 million\" (Forbes). Snopes received numerous reader inquiries about the veracity of those reports.  Over 43,000 U.S. Millionaires will get stimulus averaging $1.6 million each How Some Rich Americans Are Getting Checks Averaging $1.7 million\" The claim is multi-pronged: that millionaires and other Americans received the same type of stimulus checks, termed \"Economic Impact Payments\"; that those payments were higher for millionaires than for other workers; and that the economic benefits for the country's wealthiest residents averaged $1.7 million each under the CARES Act. other Americans The coronavirus relief package authorized the federal government to send: For single tax filers with higher annual salaries  but less than $99,000  the federal government is reducing the stimulus checks by $5 for each $100 above the $75,000 threshold (similar math goes for payments to families). Yet here is evidence that proves part of the above claim false, in the words of the IRS: \"Tax filers with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 for individuals and up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns will receive the full payment\"  which does not exceed the amounts of $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for joint claims, and $500 per qualifying child. That means only in this hypothetical situation  a family had 3,400 qualifying children  could an American receive a stimulus check of $1.7 million. Here's language verbatim from the CARES Act:   However, the latter part of the claim  that millionaires could reap an average of $1.7 million in financial gains under the CARES Act  is less definite. The answer begins with understanding pre-CARES Act tax code. In 2017, the federal government established new limitations on how much money owners of so-called \"pass-through\" businesses can deduct as losses against their \"nonbusiness\" income to minimize their tax liability. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, owners of such businesses  entities where profits flow through to owners and are not subject to corporate income taxes  could deduct a maximum of $250,000 in losses individually ($500,000 for couples) to offset taxable income from other sources, such as capital gains. Two Democratic Congressmen  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Rep. Llloyd Doggett of Texas  have explained the rule like this: pass-through\" Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, have explained If one spouse owns a company that had a $5 million loss in 2018 and the other spouse made $5 million from stock market investments, this limitation meant that the couples taxable income was $4.5 million (not zero, if the loss were allowed to fully cancel out the income). The other $4.5 million in losses, however, could be carried forward to use in future years. Provisions in the CARES Act temporarily suspended that limitation until the start of 2021, according to an analysis of legislative records by Snopes. In other words, the IRS is legally obligated to count excess losses from businesses that it otherwise wouldnt have and provide them with \"the same treatment as if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had not been enacted,\" according to attorneys with the international law firm Foley and Lardner.  Foley and Lardner Additionally, the provisions change the timeline of the 2017 law and allow for the new standard to retroactively apply, enabling businesses to report losses in 2018 and 2019 against the past five years. Those taxpayers, however, would likely need to amend their 2018 and 2019 tax returns if they have already been filed to see any changes, according to the tax consulting firm Calvetti Ferguson.  Calvetti Ferguson And since the modification under the CARES Act only applies until Dec. 31, 2020, the 2017 law will kick in the following year. Here's how that change to tax code is relevant to the claim: Americans who earn $1 million or more will benefit the most from the temporary suspension on the deduction limit, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan congressional body the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). In early April 2020, Whitehouse and Doggett requested the committee to research \"the distributional effects\" of the provision within the CARES Act. Later, the commissions chief of staff, Thomas Barthold, shared its findings in a letter to the congressmen, including the caveat: Joint Committee on Taxation in a letter There is, of course, a great deal of uncertainty about the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how those economic effects will translate into business losses for individuals. The revenue estimate represents our best effort to give Congress useful information about the potential scale of revenue changes associated with this provision. The letter included the following table, showing what class of Americans will receive what percentage of benefits from the amendment to the 2017 tax law:   The table shows almost 82% of the provision's benefits will go toward about 43,000 Americans who earn $1 million or more annually. Put another way, hedge-fund investors and owners of real estate businesses are \"far and away\" the two prime beneficiaries of the change to the 2017 tax law, Steve Rosenthal, a tax expert at the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told The Washington Post. The JCT also found that suspending the limitation for \"pass-through\" businesses will cost taxpayers about $90 billion in 2020 alone, the Post reported. Tax Policy Center The Washington Post Using those numbers, you can do back-of-the-napkin math to estimate the amount of money the country's wealthiest population could reduce from their tax burden as a result of the change (82% of $90 billion): about $73.8 billion. Then, if you divide that total by the estimated number of impacted Americans who earn $1 million or more (43,000), you end up with an average of $1,716,279  or about $1.7 million  each. \"If you take the reports calculations at face value, that means that, on average, each of the eligible taxpayers would get a windfall of ~$1.7 million! Forbes contributor Shahar Ziv wrote. Clearly not all of those earning only $1 million will receive a $1.7 million tax cut; however, just as some may receive less than the $1.7 million, some may benefit much more.\" In sum, given that U.S. millionaires won't receive stimulus payments based on their income under the CARES Act but rather the Act's provisions enable those Americans to take advantage of a temporary tax relief  potentially to the tune of $1.7 million on average  we rate this claim as a \"Mixture\" of true and false information.

I write you this message in grief in faith. My son Kaleb was rushed by ambulance to the emergency room on Wed. after we picked him up from the babysitters house. At UCH they determined that Kaleb had a SubDural Hematoma (His brain is bleeding). He then was Bayflighted (helicopter) to Tampa General Hospitals Pediatric Intensive Care Unit on a Trauma Alert. Doctors determined that Kaleb was shaken while at the homecare he goes to. He is suffering from Shaking Baby Syndrome. When we first arrived at the hospital they put a pressure gage into his head to moniter the Intercranial Pressure (The pressure that the brain is under due to swelling and Bleeding). He wasn't doing too well all day yesterday, his pressure in his head was ranging between 29-40 and the normal pressure is between 5-20. So doctors decided that the best thing to do was to put a tube into his brain to drain spinal fluid from his ventricle. This procedure was a sucess and brought the pressure down. Today however, they did a Cat Scan and saw that Kaleb is now suffering from a stroke and has formed a new bleed in the brain. I beleive in Miralcles! I believe that prayer works. I am asking you, all of my friends, whether you know me well or not to PLEASE pray for my little boy Kaleb. He needs a miracle and we need your help! I know some of you may not believe in God... But he exists! And he's already performed one miracle. Please I ask you, I beg you, to Pray for my little boy and my family. He is my everything. THANK YOU!!!\n \n Is this true? I see A LOT of stories that are emailed around the world that are similar to this story. It's been circulating through MySpace.  Here's the story that was sent to me: \"Kristy Reynolds and her husband are parents to a beautiful little baby boy named Kaleb. He is 6 months and 3 days old. A couple weeks ago Kristy picked Kaleb up from home care and noticed something was wrong. She immediately took him to the hospital where he was diagnosed with Shaken Baby Syndrome. He now has meningitis in response the the surgeries on his brain, his body can't regulate his temperature, his heart rate drops every time he is moved, and he has seizures. He is also blind. His sitter shook him so hard that he is in a coma, had to have spinal fluid drained from his brain, and doctors think that if he lives he will be a vegetable for the rest of his life. Brain scans show that his brain tissue is dying and his brain is shrinking. Kristy and her husband refuse this diagnosis and pray for their little boy. I'm asking you to join them in this prayer for Kaleb. Her myspace is:\nmyspace.com/kristyreynolds\nI went to this page and this is a beautiful baby boy!\nAE  myspace.com/kristyreynolds Thank you for your prayers.\"\n Origins:  In May 2007, Florida, newspapers reported a case of a Tampa day care worker's having been arrested on child abuse charges for allegedly having caused serious \"shaken baby\" injuries to an infant left in her care: shaken baby \n\nInvestigators say it's another case of shaken baby syndrome, and the accused says she's a scapegoat. A 5-month old boy  hasn't regained consciousness in a week, and Hillsborough County deputies have arrested the day care worker accused of hurting him, sheriffs spokeswoman Debbie Carter said. Rebecca Lois Saunders, 35, faces one count of aggravated child abuse. On the morning of May 8, the child's mother left him at Saunders' home day care center, Carter said. The baby was alert and appeared fine. When she returned that afternoon, the baby was lethargic, breathing abnormally and appeared overly sleepy, Carter said. The mother assumed he was tired, but he never regained consciousness. Becoming worried, the baby's parents rushed him to University Community Hospitals emergency room, and he was flown to Tampa General Hospital, Carter said. Doctors diagnosed the child with bilateral redness, hemorrhaging, and a subdermal hematoma, or bleeding on the brain, Carter said. The injuries were reported May 9, Carter said. A warrant was filed and Saunders was arrested at her home.\n The accused (through her attorney) maintained that she did nothing to harm the child, that she noticed something appeared to be medically wrong with the infant (i.e., his breating was \"not quite right\") and called it to the mother's attention, and that she was told by the mother that the child would be attended to.  (The case is still under review by prosecutors.) Since then, the daily updates posted to the MySpace page of young Kaleb Schwade's mother 21-year-old Kristy Schwade, and a dedicated HelpKaleb MySpace page have been elicting sympathy and donations from thousand of readers, according to the St. Petersburg Times. MySpace HelpKaleb \n\nDiane Queto, a family friend, said Schwade took Kaleb to a doctor for a respiratory infection after the call from Saunders. A day later, he was in the hospital for a brain injury. In the weeks that followed, Schwade began using MySpace to tell what was then a small group of friends how Kaleb was doing. But, soon, total strangers were viewing her page, and by Thursday, it reflected 9, 250 \"friends.\" She told them the injury had blinded Kaleb. He also acquired bacterial meningitis. A noncontagious form may occur after head surgery, a Health Department epidemiologist said. Schwade told her readers that Kaleb might end up in a vegetative state, as much as she didn't want to believe it. The injury also left him with seizures, she wrote. On her blog, Schwade details Kaleb's medications. She tells of touching moments when he grips her hand. Sentences in capital letters punctuate her feelings, and her somber messages on Kaleb's long-term prognosis usually end with religious optimism. She takes hospital bedside pictures of Kaleb and updates them often on her page, writing little captions beneath: \"The site where the tube was.\" \"The 2nd day in ICU.\" \"You can see that his eyes are open a little bit.\" Readers have posted more than 1, 300 comments on the photos. The most popular one, which has drawn about 500 posts, is a closeup of Kaleb with a breathing tube and heart monitor. \"So precious and innocent, \" wrote one reader. \"I just don't understand.\"\n A \"Prayers for Kaleb\" discussion group has also been established on the CafeMom web site. CafeMom On 25 January 2011, Kaleb's mother posted news of her son's passing to her MySpace page: \n\nKaleb went to heaven today at 5:08pm. He is now an angel and has been given the strength to walk and run and play with the other children angels. His death was very quick and he seemed very comfortable. I cannot express the gratitude for all of you and your support throughout the years. We find peace knowing that Kaleb is in heaven with Jesus and feels no pain. Thank You The Schwade Family\n\n Last updated:  28 January 2011\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   George, Justin.  \"Baby's Hospital Tale Grips MySpace.\"\n   St. Petersburg Times.  8 June 2007.

        "justification": "Claim:  A one-year-old girl named Gabrielle Dahm is missing from her home in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. TRUE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, October 2010] \nMy daughter Gabrielle Nicole Dahm was kidnapped and taken to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates by my ex-wife and her family.They are now at her parent's home in Abu Dhabi, UAE. I need to get her back legally, and quickly. I need your help with the legal expenses here in the United States, and in the Middle East. It is much more than I can handle. We set up a trust fund, where every dollar that gets donated goes to bringing Gabby home to the United States and for her well-being. It is mostly for lawyers here and in Abu Dhabi, although there are other costs as well. Please help us with anything you can, and keep Gabby in your prayers! Every dollar that you contribute helps to bring Gabby closer to HOME! The FBI has opened a full investigation, here in the United States and overseas. The State Department is working with U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi, UAE, although they do not have authority in the Middle East. I am currently working with Congressman Ron Klein's office and Senator Bill Nelson's office, though their capabilities are limited. I need to retain a law firm in Abu Dhabi, UAE, so they can file the paperwork in the UAE courts to bring Gabby home. We have to litigate the matter in their courts, and it is expensive! I am trying to get the attention of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, so she can help us to bring Gabby home! The Florida court order prohibited them from taking my daughter outside of Florida, let alone the country! They took Gabby in violation of the Florida court order. From a Loving Father who terribly MISSES his DAUGHTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!! Christopher Dahm  4330 NE 16 Ter.  Fort Lauderdale, FL  33334\n Origins:  Gabrielle Dahm is a one-year-old girl (she'll turn two in December 2010) who was reported as missing from her Fort Lauderdale, Florida, home in August 2010. missing According to Gabrielle's father, Chris Dahm, his ex-wife, with whom he shared joint custody of Gabrielle, took the girl out of the U.S. in violation of a custody agreement and has not returned: \n\nDahm said his 19-month-old daughter Gabrielle disappeared [on August 4] after his ex-wife, Leslie Delbecq, failed to drop her off at his house for their scheduled visit. Dahm and Delbecq went through a bitter divorce, which was finalized in June [2010], and granted the parents joint custody of Gabrielle. Dahm says that a condition under the custody agreement was that Gabrielle not be taken out of the country. But Dahm claims that [by August 5] he had learned that Delbecq had purchased three one way tickets to Abu Dhabi, by way of Brussels where Delbecq has dual citizenship. The tickets were in the names of his ex-wife, her mother and Gabrielle, he claims. \"I've been working closely with authorities since [August 6], and we are not sure how Gabby could have gotten out of the country without a passport,\" said Dahm. Dahm said that in 2005 his wife's family moved to Abu Dhabi because Delbecq's father got a job as a captain with Etihad Airways.\n Mr. Dahm has since established the Help Save Gabby web site in order to raise money to fund his efforts to find his daughter and return her to the U.S.: Help Save Gabby \n\nOn August 2, 2010, my ex-wife, Leslie Delbecq, and her mother, Jeanine DeRiddere-Delbecq, took Gabrielle Dahm, my daughter, with three 1-way flights to Brussels, Belgium. They then traveled to Abu Dhabi, UAE in the Middle East where my ex-wifes's parents have been residing since 2005. They violated a court order stating that Gabrielle may not leave Ft. Lauderdale, FL, or the United States for that matter. Gabrielle Nicole Dahm is my life. I recently enrolled her in St. Mark's Episcopal School in Ft. Lauderdale. It is the only school for 1 yr olds in Broward County. We were going swimming 2 times a day every morning and every evening. She couldnt swim yet although we were having a lot of fun in the pool. She loves  bubbles! We would also attend the local \"Mommy and Me and Daddy and Me\" class every Thursday night at Amandas place and she would always chase the bubbles in the room. Gabrielle Nicole Dahm is my only child, and she means everything to me! Gabby is my world! Gabby just learned to say \"Da Da\". I miss Gabby so much I can't sleep, eat, or think. I dream about her every night. I can't wait to see her and hold her in my arms again.  With the irrevocable trust that my family help me set up, Under Federal Law, EVERY dollar that gets donated to the \"Help Save Gabby Fund\" gets used for lawyers in the United States and overseas (in Abu Dhabi), for every resource possible to help bring Gabby back to the United States, and for Gabby's well-being. ALL THE FUNDS GO STRICTLY TO THIS CAUSE.         I have always donated to charitable causes and believe in supporting those in need. If you donate to your church, societies, research groups, or charities, please add this noble cause to your list.  I am grateful for whatever you can give.... I don't want to wait a lifetime to see my beautiful baby daughter again! Thank you in advance for your generous support.\n According to news accounts, the U.S. State Department has confirmed that Gabrielle is in the UAE, and in September 2010 a circuit court judge ruled that Christopher Dahm be given full custody of Gabrielle Dahm: \n\nBroward Circuit Judge Richard Y. Feder ruled that Christopher Dahm, 33, would be given full custody of Gabrielle Dahm if his ex-wife does not reply to the court by [September 29]. After a yearlong battle in circuit court, Dahm and Delbecq in January [2010] were awarded joint custody. Dahm said he hopes being awarded full custody would aid federal officials as they start trying to recover his daughter from the United Arab Emirates. The State Department has confirmed that the child is in Abu Dhabi, [Dahm's lawyer, Douglas] Reynolds said. He declined to explain how officials made that determination. Officials have told Dahm to brace for a wait of about two years before Gabrielle can be returned to South Florida, Dahm said. Meanwhile, Dahm is raising money to help pay for anticipated legal expenses, including having to potentially hire lawyers in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, he said.\n\n Last updated:  6 October 2010\n    Ortega, Juan.  \"Pompano Beach Man Claims Rx-Eife Abducted Their Daughter, Took Her Abroad.\"\n   [South Florida] Sun-Sentinel.  9 August 2010.

            "A widely circulated list of historical \"facts\" about slavery dwells on the participation of non-whites as owners and traders of slaves in America."
        ],
        "justification": "One of the less well knownaspects of the history of slavery is how many and how oftenpeople of color owned and traded slaves in earlyAmerica. Free Black slave holders could be found at one time or another \"in each of thethirteen original states and later in every state that countenanced slavery,\" historian R. Halliburton Jr. observed. That Black people bought and sold other black people raises \"vexing questions\" for 21st-centuryAmericanslikeAfrican American writerHenry Louis Gates Jr., who writes that it betraysclass divisions that have always existed within the Black community. For others, it's an excuseto deflect the shared blame for the institution of slavery in America away from white people. Henry Louis Gates Jr. In the latter vein, a \"9 Facts About Slavery They Don't Want You to Know\" meme laysouta mixture of true, false and misleading historical claims. We'll address each one in turn below:   The first legal slave owner in American history was a Black tobacco farmer named Anthony Johnson. Possibly true. The wording of the statement is important. Anthony Johnson was not the first slave owner in American history, but he was, according to historians, among the first to have his lifetime ownership of a servant legally sanctionedby a court. sanctioned A former indentured servant himself, Anthony Johnson was a so-called \"free negro\" who owned a 250-acre farm in Virginia during the 1650s, withfive indentured servantsunder contract tohim. One of them, a Black man named John Casor, claimed that his term of servicehad expired years earlier and Johnson was holding himillegally. In 1654, a civil court found that Johnson in fact owned Casor's services for life, an outcome historian R Halliburton Jr. calls \"one of the first known legal sanctions of slavery other than as a punishment for crime.\" John Casor North Carolina's largest slave holder in 1860 was a Black plantation owner named William Ellison. False. William Ellison was a very wealthy Black plantation owner and cotton gin manufacturerwholivedin South Carolina (not North Carolina). According to the 1860 census (in which his surname was listed as \"Ellerson\"), he owned 63 Black slaves, making him the largest of the 171 Black slaveholders in South Carolina, but far from the largest overall slave holder in the state. William Ellison census American Indians owned thousands of Black slaves. True. Historian Tiya Miles provided this snapshot of the Native American ownership of Black slaves at the turn of the 19th century forSlatemagazine in January 2016: snapshot Miles places the number of enslaved people held by Cherokees at around 600 at the start of the 19th century and around 1,500 at the time of westward removal in 1838-9. (Creeks, Choctaws, and Chickasaws, she said, held around 3,500 slaves, across the three nations, as the 19thcentury began.) \"Slavery inched its way slowly into Cherokee life,\" Miles told me. \"When a white man moved into a Native location, usually to work as a trader or as an Indian agent, he would own [African] slaves.\" If such a person also had a child with a Native woman, as was not uncommon, the half-European, half-Native child would inherit the enslaved people (and their children) under white law, as well as the right to use tribal lands under tribal law. This combination put such people in a position to expand their wealth, eventually operating large farms and plantations. In 1830 there were 3,775 free Black people who owned 12,740 Black slaves. Approximately true, according to historian R. Halliburton Jr.: There were approximately 319,599 free blacks in the United States in 1830. Approximately 13.7 per cent of the total black population was free. A significant number of these free blacks were the owners of slaves. The census of 1830 lists 3,775 free Negroes who owned a total of 12,760 slaves. Many Black slaves were allowed to hold jobs, own businesses, and own real estate. Somewhattrue. There were exceptions, but generally speaking especially after 1750, by which time slave codes had beenentered into the law books in most of the American colonies  Black slaves were not legally permittedto own property or businesses. From theOxford Companion to American Law (2002): Under these early codes, slaves had virtually no legal rights IN most areas they could be executed for crimes that were not capital offenses for whites. Their testimony was restricted in legal cases and could not be used either for or against whites. Trials of slaves were usually by special courts. Slaves could not own property, move about without consent of their owners, or legally marry. Brutal Black-on-Black slavery was common in Africa for thousands of years. True, in the sense that the phenomenonof human beings enslaving other human beings goes back thousands of years, but not just among Blacks, and not just in Africa. Most slaves brought to America from Africa were purchased from Black slave owners. Sort of true. Historian Steven Mintz describes the situation more accurately in the introduction to his bookAfrican-American Voices: ADocumentary Reader, 1619-1877: Apologists for the African slave trade long argued that European traders did not enslave anyone: they simply purchased Africans who had already been enslaved and who otherwise would have been put to death. Thus, apologists claimed, the slave trade actually saved lives. Such claims represent a gross distortion of the facts. Some independent slave merchants did in fact stage raids on unprotected African villages and kidnap and enslave Africans. Most professional slave traders, however, set up bases along the west African coast where they purchased slaves from Africans in exchange for firearms and other goods. Before the end of the seventeenth century, England, France, Denmark, Holland, and Portugal had all established slave trading posts on the west African coast. Yet to simply say that Europeans purchased people who had already been enslaved seriously distorts historical reality. While there had been a slave trade within Africa prior to the arrival of Europeans, the massive European demand for slaves and the introduction of firearms radically transformed west and central African society. A growing number of Africans were enslaved for petty debts or minor criminal or religious offenses or following unprovoked raids on unprotected villages. An increasing number of religious wars broke out with the goal of capturing slaves. European weapons made it easier to capture slaves. Slavery was common for thousands of years. True, as noted above though how \"common\" slavery has been and what the specific nature of that slavery was has varied according to time and place. White people ended legal chattel slavery. It's rather self-serving to claim that \"white people\" ended legal chattel slavery in the United States (much less ended chattel slavery, period), given that the overwhelming majority of Blacks in the U.S. could not vote, could not run for political office, and, in every other way conceivable, were excluded from institutional power. Moreover, even as some white people were laboring to put an end to slavery, many other white people were fighting to preserve it. Slavery was eliminated in America via the efforts of people of various ethnicities, including white people, who took up the banner of the abolitionist movement. The names of the white leaders of that movement tend to be better known than those of the Black leaders, among whom were David Walker, Frederick Douglass, Dred Scott, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Nat Turner, and many others. When Congress passed (and the states ratified) the 13th Amendment in 1865, it was the culmination of many years of work by that multi-racial movement. efforts abolitionist 13th Amendment work  Davis, J.B. \"Slavery in the Cherokee Nation.\"   Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 11, No. 4.

            "A popular meme appears to have conflated two different tax proposals from the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate."
        ],
        "justification": "In February 2020, a text meme concerning Sen. Bernie Sanders' health care plan and his proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour was circulated on social media. The meme contained several arithmetic equations that supposedly showed how the pay increase for minimum wage workers would be negated by the hike in taxes needed to pay for Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" plan:   \nBernie Sanders said at the debate last night he wants minimum wage to be $15 an hour. 15$ x 40 hr work week = $600\n600$ x 52 weeks per year = $31,200 Bernie Sanders wants free healthcare for all and was asked how he would pay for it. His answer was to raise taxes 52% on anyone making over $29,000 per year. 52% of $31,200 = $16,224 in tax\n$31,200 - $16,224 = $14,976 is your pay\n$14,976  52 weeks = $288 per week\n$288  40 hr week = $7.20 per hour But there's no need to check the arithmetic in this meme. The general claim here  that Sanders' health care plan would raise the tax rate to 52% on everyone making over $29,000 per year  is egregiously false. In short, no. One proposal offered by Sanders would raise the tax rate to 52% on earnings over $10 million. Sanders also proposed that the first $29,000 of a person's income would be exempt from taxes, and a 4% income-based premium would be applied to earnings over $29,000. The meme asserts that Sanders made this claim \"at the debate last night.\" As this meme started circulating in mid-February 2020, we'll assume that timing refers to the Democratic presidential debate held in Las Vegas on Feb. 17, 2020. Although Sanders did say that he wanted to raise the minimum wage to $15 during that debate, he did not say that he would pay for his health care plan by raising \"taxes to 52% on anybody making over $29,000 a year.\" Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg did maintain that \"taxes will go up on anybody making more than $29,000\" under Sanders' tax plan, but Buttigieg did not claim that the tax rate would increase to 52% for these individuals. Sanders disputed Buttigieg's claim during the debate, saying the latter was \"not being honest\" and that any tax increase for low-wage workers would be offset by lower health care costs. Here's an excerpt of the exchange between the two men (a full transcript of the debate is available here): here BUTTIGIEG: [Sanders] was a congressman at the time. And the qualities I admired then are qualities I still respect a great deal. I never said that I agree with every part of his policy views, then or now. But I appreciate that at least he's straightforward and honest about them. He's honest about the fact that taxes will go up on anybody making more than $29,000 to fund his health care plan, although, again, a little bit vague about how the rest of that gets ... SANDERS: You're not being honest. Premiums would be eliminated. BUTTIGIEG: But you're still raising those taxes. And when you do it... SANDERS: But we're saving people money because they don't pay any premiums, out-of-pocket expenses, co-payments, or deductibles. They're going to be much better off. [applause] BUTTIGIEG: But where is  where is the other $25 trillion supposed to come from? At a certain point, you've got to do the math. SANDERS: Well, we got it all up there on the internet. It's a payroll tax  a payroll tax... [crosstalk] BUTTIGIEG: Well, no, but even after the payroll tax, you still have a hole. [crosstalk] SANDERS: Because we have a wealth tax. Elizabeth [Warren] has a good one. Ours is a little bit tougher on Mr. Bloomberg than hers. We're going to raise it in a progressive way, which deals with income and wealth inequality, and makes certain, finally, that health care in this country is a human right, not a privilege. Although Sanders did not reference it during that debate, we did find mention of a 52% tax rate on a document he released to explain various \"options to finance Medicare for All.\" That document stated that the 52% tax rate would be applied to earnings over $10 million, not $29,000 as claimed in the meme. Here's the relevant excerpt from that document (emphasis ours): document Another option is to reform the personal income tax system by strengthening progressive income tax rates, taxing capital gains and dividends the same as work income, limiting deductions for the wealthy, taxing carried interest as ordinary income, and requiring derivatives to be marked to market. Progressive income tax rates. Under this plan the marginal income tax rate would be: Sanders mentioned the $29,000 figure in another document entitled \"Financing Medicare for All.\" This documented listed a few additional ways to pay for Medicare for All, including a 4% income-based premium on incomes over $29,000. Here's an excerpt from that document (emphasis ours): Financing Medicare for All As the wealthiest country in the world, we have a variety of options available to support a Medicare for All, single-payer health care system that guarantees high quality, affordable health care as a right, not a privilege, to every man, woman, and child in this country. Those options include, but are not limited to: Sanders elaborated on this portion of his plan during a September 2019 appearance on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\": September 2019  Sanders made a similar statement during a town hall in New Hampshire in November 2019. Sanders again said that the first $29,000 of an individual's earnings would be exempt from taxes and then a 4% tax rate would apply on earnings over $29,000: town hall What we will do  what we will do is have a four percent tax on income exempting the first $29,000,\" Sanders told his supporters. \"All right, good. You  youre better at arithmetic than I am. Because what that means is if you are that average family in the middle who makes $60,000 a year, that means were going to tax you on $31,000 at four percent. We were unable to find any instance of Sanders' proposing a 52% tax rate on \"anybody making over $29,000\" per year, something that appears to be an erroneous conflation of Sanders' proposing a 4% tax rate on earnings over $29,000 and a 52% tax rate on earnings over $10 million. A counter-meme offered a more accurate (although still not entirely accurate) look at Sanders' actual expressed plans:  This meme, too, makes a mistake. Sanders' tax proposal uses a marginal tax rate (or a progressive tax rate), which means that a different tax rate is applied to different portions of a person's income. The percentage taxed starts relatively small, but grows as income increases. In Sanders' case, the first $29,000 of a person's income would be exempt from taxes. When a person's income crosses the $29,000 threshold, a 4% tax will be applied to earnings OVER$29,000. This tax rate continues to grow as income increases. Income over $10 million, for instance, would be taxed at 52%. But the above-displayed meme applies a 4% tax rate to ALL $31,200. Under Sanders' plan, however, the first $29,000 would be exempt and the 4% tax rate would only apply to the remaining $2,200. We reached out to Sanders' campaign for comment on the claim that the candidate was planning to raise the tax rate to 52% on everyone making over $29,000 per year.

            "During a presidential debate Hillary Clinton mentioned a four-minute response window for launching missiles during a nuclear attack, but that information wasn't secret."
        ],
        "justification": "During the third and final presidential debate on 19 October 2016, social media users began tweeting up a storm claiming Hillary Clinton \"leaked\" classified information by revealing details about the United States' nuclear response protocols, specifically that the timeframe between a presidential order and a launch of nuclear weapons was four minutes: This is actually true, @StateDept @TheJusticeDept @DeptofDefense, @CENTCOM, do you job, she just slipped #DebateNight pic.twitter.com/7qu3qPSpW7 @StateDept @TheJusticeDept @DeptofDefense @CENTCOM #DebateNight pic.twitter.com/7qu3qPSpW7  MicroSpookyLeaks (@WDFx2EU7) October 20, 2016 October 20, 2016  The exchange in question occurred during a debate over diplomatic relations with Russia and allegations that the Russian government had attempted to interfere in the 2016 election. Moderator Chris Wallace asked Donald Trump whether he \"condemn[ed] any interference by Russia in the American election,\" to which Trump answered in the affirmative. The discussion then turned to nuclear weapons (at the 33-minute mark in the clip below), a subject which Hillary Clinton contended showed her opponent to be unsuitable for the presidency: asked CLINTON: I  I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons. This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. He's...  TRUMP: Wrong.  CLINTON: ... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia. He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying ... But here's the deal. The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button. At 8:35 PM on 19 October 2016, Clinton published a tweet on the same subject, stating that a president's decision to use nuclear weapons \"can take as little as four minutes\" (from order to launch) suggesting that the window she referenced was somewhat fluid: When the president gives the order to launch a nuclear weapon, thats it. The officer has to launch. It can take as little as four minutes.  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 20, 2016 October 20, 2016 Most of the people tweeting that Clinton had \"leaked\" classified information by mentioning this window cited no specific information substantiating that to be true (or explaining how they themselves could know and openly discuss information that was supposedly classified).   If the information were indeed classified, confirming it with any government agency would prove difficult, for obvious reasons.  An alternative method of determining whether Clinton inadvertently disclosed classified information about nuclear protocols would be to verify if that information was already publicly known and open discussed.  Indeed, on 5 August 2016 Foreign Policy magazine published an article about that very subject with a subhead that openly proclaimed it: article  The piece had been inspired by (an unsubstantiated) rumor spread by MSNBC host Joe Scarborough suggesting that Donald Trump appeared interested in having the United States use nuclear weapons. The article's author cited a book \"Walter Slocombe wrote nearly 30 years ago\" as well as a contemporaneous \"nuclear timeline\" examining whether nuclear \"launch under attack\" was \"feasible.\" Based on discussion that occurred during the MSNBC segment about the steps leading up to the use of nukes, the article focused on the \"timeline\" of nuclear events based on an anecdote from 1979: nuclear weapons nuclear timeline All those steps leave something like eight minutes from the first call to the White House to the last moment at which the president can act. Much of those eight minutes is lost to the task of informing the president. The first call to the White House isnt to the president, of course. It is to a person designated by the president for this task. (Well, probably the military assistant to that person  another minute ticks off the clock.) In November 1979, that person was Zbigniew Brzezinski  then-President Jimmy Carters national security advisor and father to Mika, who was sitting next to Scarborough, solemnly shaking her head at the idea of Trump with the bomb. You should really watch Zbig tell the story, though the bottom line is that he recalled having only three minutes to decide whether or not to inform the president,  after which the president had four minutes to decide whether or not to retaliate. At the end of his three minutes, Brzezinskis military assistant called back to tell him it was a false alarm  someone had left a training tape running. Brzezinski went back to bed. He never woke his wife, by the way. He decided that if it was a Soviet nuclear attack, it was better to let her die in her sleep. (At this point the substance of the claim diverges slightly, from holding that it takes four minutes to launch nuclear weapons once the President has given the order to do so, to holding that the President has four minutes to decide whether to launch nuclear weapons once he's been informed that a nuclear attack on the U.S. is imminent.) Internet chatter from 2015 also described \"four minutes\" as an old Cold War rule of thumb for the timeframe between first detection of incoming nuclear missiles and those missiles' hitting their targets. described Most articles on the subject published prior to the debate referenced (as Clinton's tweet appeared to do) a windows of roughly between four to 12 minutes in which a sitting President must decide to launch a nuclear attack: windows Although [nuclear response protocol] remains shrouded in secrecy, we actually know a great deal about it, beginning with the presidents first task of opening the nuclear suitcase in an emergency to review his nuclear attack options ... Let us say the president is awakened in the middle of the night (the proverbial 3 a.m. phone call) by his or her top nuclear adviser and told of an incoming nuclear strike. Since the flight time of missiles fired from launch stations in Russia or China to the White House is 30 minutes, and 12 minutes or less for missiles fired from submarines lurking in the Western Atlantic Ocean (Russian subs historically favor a patrol area to the west of Bermuda), the steadiness and brainpower of the commander in chief in such circumstances are serious questions indeed. This call has never happened, but if it ever does, the situation would be as stressful and dangerous as things ever get inside the Oval Office. The closest we came to such a call occurred in 1979, when the consoles at our early warning hub in Colorado lit up with indications of a large-scale Soviet missile attack. President Jimmy Carters national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, received back-to-back calls in the middle of the night informing him of the imminent nuclear destruction of the United States ... Just before he picked up the phone to call Carter, Brzezinski received a third call, this time canceling the alarm. It was a mistake caused by human and technical error. A training tape simulating an all-out Soviet attack had inadvertently slipped into the actual real-time attack early warning network. The impending nuclear holocaust was a mirage that confused the duty crew. (They were fired for taking eight minutes instead of the required three minutes to declare their degree of confidence that an attack against North America was underway.) How would a President Trump behave under such duress, informed of the attack and the imminent destruction of the nations capital and himself? He would have only a few minutes to consider the reliability of the attack report and decide whether and how to retaliate. If the attack is real, and he hesitates, a president will likely be killed and the chain of command decapitated, perhaps permanently. Among the people weighing in after the debate were who were able to assess the rumor and rate it was nuclear security expert Joe Cirincione, who issued two tweets about the controversy  one explicitly stating that Clinton did not disclose classified information and another reiterating that the information was already widely known and often cited: No, @HillaryClinton did not reveal any secret about how quickly we can launch ?. This is widely known, often cited. https://t.co/3z2VQEUlDm @HillaryClinton https://t.co/3z2VQEUlDm  Joe Cirincione (@Cirincione) October 20, 2016 October 20, 2016 Another example of public expert citation of the dangerously fast, 4-5 minute launch times of our nuclear missiles. https://t.co/y1xTTu6K4X https://t.co/y1xTTu6K4X  Joe Cirincione (@Cirincione) October 20, 2016 October 20, 2016  Blair, Bruce.  \"What Exactly Would It Mean to Have Trumps Finger on the Nuclear Button?\r\n  Politico.  11 June 2016.

            "Does the number of hooves lifted into the air on equestrian statues reveal how the riders died?"
        ],
        "justification": "Folk wisdom has it that equestrian statues contain a code whereby the rider's fate can be determined by noting how many hooves the horse has raised. The most common theory has it that if one hoof is raised, the rider was wounded in battle (possibly dying of those wounds later but not necessarily so); two raised hooves, death in battle; all four hooves on the ground, the rider survived all battles unharmed.  However, even the most cursory look at the statues around other sites, such as Washington, D.C., quickly disproves that the hoof code holds sway in general. Washington is home to more equestrian statues than any other city in the nation, and it's significant that perhaps only 10 out of 30 or more follow the convention. Here's a quick look-see at various equestrian statues in Washington and how they fit or don't fit this theory. First, some statues that follow the \"rule\": And now some that don't: An additional rumored statue code is prevalent in Virginia's Monument Avenue in Richmond. The Civil War statues honoring Gens. Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee, J.E.B. Stuart, and Confederate President Jefferson Davis are pointed in distinct directions, according to local lore -- the statues of those who died in the war face north, while the statues of those who survived the war face south. Upon examination, we find local lore initially appears to have something going for it, but appearances are deceiving. The equestrian statues of Lee, facing south, and Jackson, facing north, do fit the formula, and the horse of Stuart, who was mortally wounded at Yellow Tavern in 1864, faces north. But the heads of Stuart, Davis, and Matthew Fontaine Maury face east. \"To the best of anyone's knowledge, the position and pose of the statue do not signify anything,\" said Frances Pollard, a curator at the Virginia Historical Society. Those who should known better continue to pass along this piece of folklore as fact, as evidenced by this July 2001 question and response in Marilyn vos Savant's Ask Marilyn column: Q: One often sees commemorative statues of soldiers mounted on horses with their forelegs in various positions. Is there any significance to the difference? A: Yes, although some sculptors may be unaware of the tradition or choose to ignore it. A historian at Arlington National Cemetery explains that when both forelegs of the horse are in the air, the rider died in battle. When only one foreleg is raised, the rider died of his wounds afterward. And when all four legs are on the ground, the rider later died of unrelated causes. Hmm ... a vocational \"tradition\" that those who practice the trade are either complete unaware of, or choose to ignore when they do know of it.  Given that the alleged statuary code consists of three poses (no hooves raised, one hoof raised, and two hooves raised), the odds that a rider's manner of death would correspond to his horse's pose through plain chance are one in three, which is the proportion we find when surveying the equestrian statues in our nation's capital  that is, only about ten out of thirty statues in Washington, D.C., follow the \"traditional\" pattern.  (Please don't write to tell us that the odds of a given person's manner of death matching the \"correct\" statuary code are one in nine, not one in three. The latter is correct.) The connection between statuary horses hooves' and the manner of deaths of their riders is not \"tradition,\" but  like the well-known but mundane list of \"coincidences\" between the Lincoln and Kennedy assassinations  an attempt to create an interesting piece of information (in this case, something akin to a \"secret code\") by finding patterns in randomness through the expedient of simply ignoring or explaining away all the cases that don't fit the pattern. This type of statuary lore is neither new nor unique to equestrian statuary, as a similar \"tradition\" (i.e., fallacy) was attributed well over a century ago, in the same fashion, to sculptors who had created effigies of knights several hundred years earlier: coincidences \nClaim: The crossing of the legs and/or arms of the effigies of certain Knights indicates that they were Crusaders and the number of crusades in which they took part. Mr. Donald Gunn kindly dealt with this matter as follows:\nProof of the error lies in the following facts: The Rev. C.J. Cox, who, I suppose, was one of our soundest ecclesiologists, wrote: Surely it is time that the imaginary connection between cross-legged effigies and the Crusades should be exploded; and yet how rampant is that fiction in certain places, and how constantly it has to be contradicted! [T]he popular fiction that cross-legged effigies are monuments of Knights Templar has evidently arisen from the fact that six out of nine effigies in the Temple Church are so represented ... With the exception, however, of one effigy, which is not cross-legged, it is extremely doubtful whether any of these celebrated figures are memorials of Templars.

            "Did three former Fannie Mae executives serve the Obama campaign as economic advisors?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Three former Fannie Mae executives served on Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign as chief economic advisors. FALSE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, September 2008] \nHere is a quick look into 3 former Fannie Mae executives who have brought down Wall Street. Franklin Raines was a Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Fannie Mae. Raines was forced to retire from his position with Fannie Mae when auditing discovered severe irregularities in Fannie Mae's accounting activities. At the time of his departure The Wall Street Journal noted, 'Raines, who long defended the company's accounting despite mounting evidence that it wasn't proper, issued a statement late Tuesday conceding that 'mistakes were made' and saying he would assume responsibility as he had earlier promised. News reports indicate the company was under growing pressure from regulators to shake up its management in the wake of findings that the company's books ran afoul of generally accepted accounting principles for four years.' Fannie Mae had to reduce its surplus by $9 billion. Raines left with a 'golden parachute valued at $240 Million in benefits. The Government filed suit against Raines when the depth of the accounting scandal became clear. The Government noted, 'The 101 charges reveal how the individuals improperly manipulated earnings to maximize their bonuses, while knowingly neglecting accounting systems and internal controls, misapplying over twenty accounting principles and misleading the regulator and the public. The Notice explains how they submitted six years of misleading and inaccurate accounting statements and inaccurate capital reports that enabled them to grow Fannie Mae in an unsafe and unsound manner.' These charges were made in 2006. The Court ordered Raines to return $50 Million Dollars he received in bonuses based on the miss-stated Fannie Mae profits. Tim Howard - Was the Chief Financial Officer of Fannie Mae. Howard 'was a strong internal proponent of using accounting strategies that would ensure a 'stable pattern of earnings' at Fannie. In everyday English - he was cooking the books. The Government Investigation determined that, 'Chief Financial Officer, Tim Howard, failed to provide adequate oversight to key control and reporting functions within Fannie Mae,' On June 16, 2006, Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., asked the Justice Department to investigate his allegations that two former Fannie Mae executives lied to Congress in October 2004 when they denied manipulating the mortgage-finance giant's income statement to achieve management pay bonuses. Investigations by federal regulators and the company's board of directors since concluded that management did manipulate 1998 earnings to trigger bonuses. Raines and Howard resigned under pressure in late 2004. Howard's Golden Parachute was estimated at $20 Million! Jim Johnson - A former executive at Lehman Brothers and who was later forced from his position as Fannie Mae CEO. A look at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight's May 2006 report on mismanagement and corruption inside Fannie Mae, and you'll see some interesting things about Johnson. Investigators found that Fannie Mae had hidden a substantial amount of Johnson's 1998 compensation from the public, reporting that it was between $6 million and $7 million when it fact it was $21 million.' Johnson is currently under investigation for taking illegal loans from Countrywide while serving as CEO of Fannie Mae. Johnson's Golden Parachute was estimated at $28 Million. WHERE ARE THEY NOW? FRANKLIN RAINES? Raines works for the Obama Campaign as Chief Economic Advisor TIM HOWARD? Howard is also a Chief Economic Advisor to Obama JIM JOHNSON? Johnson hired as a Senior Obama Finance Advisor and was selected to run Obama's Vice Presidential Search Committee  IF OBAMA PLANS ON CLEANING UP THE MESS - HIS ADVISORS HAVE THE EXPERTISE - THEY MADE THE MESS IN THE FIRST PLACE. Would you trust the men who tore Wall Street down to build the New Wall Street?\n Origins:  When one of the hottest issues of a presidential campaign is the meltdown of the mortgage lending industry and the collapse of the economy, a candidate's having economic advisors on his staff who are strongly associated with the system and practices that helped create the current mess likely wouldn't sit well with the public.  That's the premise of the above-quoted e-mail, which claimed that three men formerly associated with the Federal National Mortgage Association (commonly known as \"Fannie Mae\") were serving as \"chief economic advisors\" with the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama.  However, although some of these men had at least tangential connections to the Obama campaign at one time or another, none of them had ongoing roles with that campaign as chief economic advisors. Franklin Raines, who formerly headed the budget office for the Clinton administration, became the first black CEO of a Fortune 500 company when he took over at Fannie Mae\" in 1999.  Raines,  who had earned $20 million in salary and bonuses from Fannie Mae in 2003, resigned from his CEO position in 2004 after regulators determined that the company had violated accounting rules and created an illusory $9 billion in past profit.   Raines had some dealings with the Obama campaign, but he never held any actual position within the campaign (much less as its \"chief economic advisor\"), and his involvement with it was not nearly as substantial as implied above.  As the Washington Post reported when a McCain campaign commercial attempted to link Raines with the Democratic candidate, the whole substance of the connection between the two men was that Raines \"had gotten a couple of calls from the Obama campaign\" in which they talked about \"general housing and economy issues.\"  reported commercial Franklin Raines' predecessor, James A. Johnson, (former chief of staff to Vice President Walter F. Mondale), was CEO of Fannie Mae from 1991 to 1998. After Johnson left the company, regulators later discovered that Fannie Mae had engaged in fraudulent accounting practices in 1998 which manipulated its earnings so that executives could earn performance bonuses (up to $1.9 million in Johnson's case) they would not otherwise have been entitled to. discovered In May 2008, Senator Obama tapped James Johnson to be one member of a three-person panel tasked with vetting potential vice-presidential running mates.  Johnson (who was not serving as an economic advisor to the Obama campaign) resigned from that position shortly afterwards when news accounts reported that he had received more than $2 million in home loans at below average market rates from Countrywide Financial (a partner of Fannie Mae). Tim Howard, the former CFO (chief financial officer) of Fannie Mae, was caught up in the same accounting scandal that undid Franklin Raines, and (like Raines) resigned from the company in 2004.   We found no substantive connection between Tim Howard and the Obama campaign, however, much less any information supporting the claim that Howard was ever a \"Chief Economic Advisor to Obama.\"   Last updated:  3 January 2012\n    Smith, Elliot Blair.  \"Former Fannie Mae Execs May Face Investigation.\"\n   USA Today.  14 June 2006.

            "Whether those contrasting statements document the senator to be a \"hypocrite\" is a thornier question."
        ],
        "justification": "Shortly after U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden named Sen. (and former California Attorney General) Kamala Harris as his running mate in August 2020, social media users began circulating a meme purportedly showing two contradictory statements Harris had made about the value of having more police on the streets, along with commentary painting Harris as a \"lying hypocrite\": meme   In a strictly literal sense, the meme correctly attributes to Harris two contrasting statements she made 11 years apart, as The New York Times noted in an August 2020 article about Harris' viewpoint on police misconduct: noted In her 2009 book, Smart on Crime, she wrote that if we take a show of hands of those who would like to see more police officers on the street, mine would shoot up, adding that virtually all law-abiding citizens feel safer when they see officers walking a beat. Earlier this summer, in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, she told The New York Times that it is status-quo thinking to believe that putting more police on the streets creates more safety. Thats wrong. Its just wrong. Whether those contrasting statements document Harris to be a \"liar\" or a \"hypocrite\" is a thornier question, however. Altering one's viewpoint about an issue over the course of many years is not necessarily hypocritical, especially if such evolution is based on additional knowledge and experience and/or shifting conditions -- it's only hypocritical if a given viewpoint is an insincere one, expressed for purposes of political expediency rather than genuine belief. In 2009, Harris was district attorney of San Francisco, but by 2020, she had served a six-year tenure as California's attorney general and was well into her fourth year as a U.S. senator. Certainly occurrences that took place, and the experience she accumulated, during that 11-year span might have prompted a change in her thinking. As well, it's important to note the context in which Harris made those statements. The first was taken from her 2009 book Smart on Crime, in a chapter that was specifically about the evolution of methods for fighting crime. The chapter was titled \"Myth: The tools of crime fighting never change\" and opened with the statement that \"the secret of successfully reducing crime is that there is no one secret to successfully reducing crime,\" so Harris was arguing against a status quo approach and emphasizing the need for measuring how effectively police were actually making communities safer (rather than merely creating the appearance of safety): On one hand, if we take a show of hands of those who would like to see more police officers on the streets, mine would shoot up. A more visible and strategic police presence is a deterrent to crime, and it has a positive impact on a community. Virtually all law-abiding citizens feel safer when they see officers walking a beat. This is as true in economically poor neighborhoods as in wealthy ones. Police officers are a reassuring sign of a community's commitment to order, calm, and safety. More beat cops means more rapid response to assaults, traffic crimes, and robberies and has a profound effect on reducing quality-of-life crimes by simple presence. But in addition to putting more police on the street, we have to look at the way officers are being deployed and how we measure whether they are achieving the goal of creating a safer community. Her second statement came in the midst of nationwide protests spurred by the police custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020, when long-simmering issues of police violence and the treatment of Blacks by police came to a boil -- all while the U.S. was grappling with a nationwide shutdown due to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. At that point, many Americans decidedly did not hold to the notion that the increased presence of police made them safer (or made them feel safer) and gave rise to \"defund the police\" movements. It was in that context that Harris responded to a question about police by asserting that \"status quo thinking\" was wrong and that \"we have to reimagine what public safety looks like\": Q: Can I ask you about this idea of defunding the police? Whats your thinking on that idea? A: Well, its a concept. We do have to reimagine what public safety looks like. And heres the thing. It is status quo thinking to believe that putting more police on the streets creates more safety. Thats wrong. Its just wrong. You know what creates more safety? Funding public schools, affordable housing, increased homeownership, job skill development, jobs, access to capital for those who want to start small businesses, or who are running small businesses in communities. But, no, were not going to get rid of the police. We all have to be practical. But lets separate out these discussions. Many cities in our country spend one-third of their entire budget on policing. With all the responsibilities those cities have, one-third on policing? Put it in the context of the fact that over the last many decades, we have essentially been defunding public schools. If anyone thinks that the way were going to cure these problems is by putting more police on the street, theyre wrong. In the period between those statements, The New York Times observed, Harris has \"struggled to reconcile her calls for reform with her record as a prosecutor\" -- enduring criticism for not intervening in cases of controversial police shootings and for \"yielding to the status quo\" rather than pursuing \"bold reform,\" while \"her approach was subtly shifting\" nonetheless: Since becoming Californias attorney general in 2011, she had largely avoided intervening in cases involving killings by the police. Protesters in Oakland distributed fliers saying: Tell California Attorney General Kamala Harris to prosecute killer cops! Its her job! Then, amid the national outrage stoked by the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., came pleas for her to investigate a series of police shootings in San Francisco, where she had previously been district attorney. She did not step in. Except in extraordinary circumstances, she said, it was not her job. Still, her approach was subtly shifting. During the inaugural address for her second term as attorney general, Ms. Harris said the nations police forces faced a crisis of confidence. And by the end of her tenure in 2016, she had proposed a modest expansion of her offices powers to investigate police misconduct, begun reviews of two municipal police departments and backed a Justice Department investigation in San Francisco. Critics saw her taking baby steps when bold reform was needed  a microcosm of a career in which she developed a reputation for taking cautious, incremental action on criminal justice and, more often than not, yielding to the status quo. So yes, across an 11-year span, Harris did offer the contrasting statements about police displayed above. Whether they're evidence of hypocrisy on her part or of an authentic shift in her thinking and viewpoint is a subjective issue. Harris, Kamala with Joan O'C. Hamilton.

        "justification": "Claim:  Groups of gang members are committing robberies and carjackings in Round Rock, Texas. UNDETERMINED Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2003] \nYesterday  I was in Round Rock talking with Mrs. Sue Livingston, a Round Rock Acupuncturist.  Mrs. Livingston told me about a very scary episode that happened to her on Monday night.  She had a late 7:00 p.m. appointment with a close friend at her office on North Mayes street which is the main street in Round Rock.  After the appointment she and her client went to\ndinner and a movie and returned about 11:00 p.m. to her office in order for her client to pick up her car.  As she drove to the office she noticed two police cars at a 7 Eleven two doors away.  When she pulled into her office parking lot adjacent to North Mayes Street she headed into the space facing the Sonic next to her property.  The Sonic is separated from her parking lot by shrubs. As she pulled into the space, a later model foreign car with five black men pulled in behind her and blocked her Jeep into the parking space. When she looked up a very large black man tried to pull her door open which was fortunately locked.  As she looked up again, the four other men when putting hoods over their heads and approaching the car.  With quick thinking she put her car into reverse and slammed the car blocking her Jeep into the parking space out of the way and jumped the curb and sidewalk back into Mayes street and immediately went to the 7 Eleven where the police were.  The police were unable to apprehend these men. After talking with a detective at the Round Rock Police force, they told Mrs. Livingston that they believe this is a group of gang members trying to rob people and steal cars.  They believe that a woman that was robbed and raped at the Salt Grass Restaurant right on IH 35 in Round Rock last week was attacked by these same men.  They also have reports that lead them to believe they robbed and attacked a college age couple in Temple. The young man and his girl friend were on a date and had gone to a movie and when he drove her back to her car in a public parking lot at the mall the\nsame incident occurred.  In this case the man was outside the car and was robbed at gun point.  The man refused to force his girl friend out of the car and was severely beaten.  Four of the men were known to have guns. It is believed that these gang members are working areas along IH 35 between Waco and San Antonio.  BE SURE that your family members and especially your wives and daughters are aware of these incidents.  Be sure to keep your car doors locked and do not get blocked into a parking space.  Be EXTREMELY careful in public parking spaces.  They believe that these individuals may be on PCP, Angel Dust, or some other narcotic as the attack on Mrs. Livingston was made within 500 feet of two parked Round Rock Police cars next to Sonic on a major street.  These men are EXTREMELY dangerous.  If you notice anything suspicious report it. Stay safe! THIS IS NOT URBAN LEGEND, THIS IS A REAL AND CURRENT SITUATION!   Origins:  Although we haven't looked into the issue of groups of armed gang members committing robberies,  carjackings, and rapes in Round Rock, Texas (a town just outside the state capital of Austin), we offer this example to demonstrate the often jarring differences of information reported in dire \"crime warning\" e-mails and information obtained by talking to the police.   What follows is the Round Rock Police Department's response to the e-mail quoted above: Round Rock \n\nConcerned Citizens, Good morning. I would like to introduce myself. My name is Shawn Scott. I am a Detective with the Round Rock Police Department. I would like to take this time to address the email that seems to be circulating through Round Rock. First, the incident involving Sue Livingston has been reported to Round Rock P. D.  We are currently investigating the incident and do take this very seriously.  Part of our investigation is to prove the intent of the suspect. We encourage citizens with any information regarding this incident to contact the Round Rock Police Department. You may also contact me with any questions or concerns you may have and I will be more than happy to discuss them with you. Second, I would like to clarify the incident that occurred at the Salt Grass restaurant in Round Rock. This incident occurred last year, almost four months ago (not last week). The victim in this incident was not sexually assaulted (or raped as the email stated) nor was the suspect armed. I would like to reiterate that I am not at all minimizing this type of incident. I just wanted to clarify the email. Currently, we have no reason to believe the incident at Salt Grass and the report involving Sue Livingston are related.    Third, I want to let the citizens of Round Rock know that we do NOT have a rash of carjackings in our city. The incident involving Sue Livingston is the first one of this sort reported. I would further add that I am not aware of any rash of carjackings in our surrounding area.  We are checking with Temple P.D. for clarification of information printed in the email regarding the incident there.  I have contacted the Temple victim regarding the incident there and have learned that no car jacking occurred. The information contained in the \"this is not a joke email\" did not come from Round Rock P.D. as indicated.  Furthermore, Round Rock P.D. is not currently aware of any armed gang of black males\ncommitting car jackings in our city.   Last, I want to reassure the citizens of Round Rock that you live in a safe community. I would encourage everyone to be cautious and aware of your surroundings at all times. Sue Livingston should be\ncommended for her bravery and quick actions to remove herself from harms way. Please do not hesitate to report suspicious activity to Police. Thank you for your time and please forward this email to others.

        ],
        "justification": " Claim:  A pending ballot initiative would make homosexuality a capital crime in California. MIXTURE Example:  [Collected via e-mail, February 2015] \nI'm hoping this is fake. The Sodomite Suppression Act ballot initiative was filed in California last month.\n\n   Origins:  On 24 February 2015, Huntington Beach attorney Matthew McLaughlin filed a proposed ballot initiative titled \"The Sodomite Suppression Act\" with the California Attorney General's office.  The measure sought to make any homosexual sex act a crime punishable by death (via \"death by bullets to the head or by any other convenient method\"), outlaw the distribution of \"Sodomistic propaganda\" (with penalties for violation ranging from imprisonment to a $1 million fine to permanent expulsion from California), and to bar \"sodomites\" from public employment, public office, and public benefits: initiative \n\na) The abominable crime against nature known as buggery, called also\nsodomy, is a monstrous evil that Almighty God, giver of freedom and liberty,\ncommands us to suppress on pain of our utter destruction even as he\noverthrew Sodom and Gomorrha. b) Seeing that it is better that offenders should die rather than that\nall of us should be killed by God's just wrath against us for the folly\nof tolerating-wickedness in our midst, the People of California wisely\ncommand, in the fear of God, that any person who willingly touches another\nperson of the same gender for purposes of sexual gratification be put to\ndeath by bullets to the head or by any other convenient method. c) No person shall distribute, perform, or transmit sodomistic\npropaganda directly or indirectly by any means to any person under the\nage of majority. Sodomistic propaganda is defined as anything aimed at\ncreating an interest in or an acceptance of human sexual relations other\nthan between a man and a woman. Every offender shall be fined $1 million\nper occurrence, and/or imprisoned up to 10 years, and/or expelled from\nthe boundaries of the state of California for up to life. d) No person shall serve in any public office, nor serve in public\nemployment, nor enjoy any public benefit, who is a sodomite or who espouses\nsodomistic propaganda or who belongs to any group that does. e) This law is effective immediately and shall not be rendered\nineffective nor invalidated by any court, state or federal, until heard\nby a quorum of the Supreme Court of California consisting only of judges\nwho are neither sodomites nor subject to disqualification hereunder.\n McLaughlin also included (an unenforceable) provision in his initiative barring its invalidation by anyone other than a \"non-sodomite\" quorum of state Supreme Court judges: \n\nThis law is effective immediately and shall not be rendered ineffective or invalidated by any court, state or federal, until heard by a quorum of the Supreme Court of California consisting only of judges who are neither sodomites nor subject to disqualification hereunder.\n\n The extreme nature of the \"Sodomite Suppression Act\" led many readers to question its authenticity, particularly the putative reasoning behind it.  Is McLaughlin a prankster who submitted the initiative purely as a spoof, was he trying to make a point about a need to reform the California initiative process, or is he really possessed of\nfundamentalist beliefs?  These questions remain unanswered as McLaughlin has been unavailable since news of his proposed measure hit the media, but this measure wasn't his first effort along these lines, and the nature of one of his previous ballot proposals doesn't rule out any of those possibilities: previous \n\nA Huntington Beach attorney who credits the Bible with helping him become an honor student is pushing for a state ballot measure to put the Scriptures in the hands of public school students as a literary text. Matt McLaughlin received approval from the secretary of state's office to begin gathering signatures for the King James Bible as Textbook initiative, which would amend the Constitution to allow teachers to use the Bible in literature classes. \"Even if you don't believe its teachings, you'll agree that it includes rich usage of the English language,\" he said. \"That's what makes it good literature.\" Under the proposal, classroom Bible reading would still be voluntary, and students could substitute another text, said McLaughlin.\n It is true that McLaughlin really did file the proposal (along with the required $200 filing fee), but that act alone will not get it voted upon by California residents.  McLaughlin still has to collect 365,000 signatures from Californians first, and as the San Diego Union-Tribune observed, this measure has zero chance of actually making its way onto a ballot, being approved by voters, or withstanding constitutional scrutiny: \n\nIt's unclear if [McLaughlin] will actually make an effort to collect signatures. If he does, he will need to collect the valid signatures of more than 365,000 registered California voters in just 180 days. He won't be able to do it. If, miraculously, he did gather sufficient signatures, it would go on the ballot in November 2016. California voters would overwhelmingly reject it. If, through some incredible and shocking mistake, voters approved it, it would be quickly challenged in court again and at that point it would be quickly ruled unconstitutional.\n Or, as James Ching detailed on the Law.com web site: detailed \n\nLegally, the initiative is an appalling mess. Like your Aunt Hattie's mauve and chartreuse 1959 Caddy, one simply stares at it in disbelief. Subdivision (b) creates a new defense to murder; subdivision (c) creates a category of speech in a manner suspect under the First Amendment and proposes what may seem excessive fines; subdivision (d) seems to effect discrimination under the 14th Amendment and the First Amendment; subdivision (e) disturbs the separation of powers, as the Legislature cannot ex post facto disqualify a judicial officer and certainly not without appropriate due process; and subdivision (f) is void for vagueness, in addition to creating blanket defenses for whatever violations of law are committed in \"execut[ing] all the provisions [of the initiative] extra-judicially.\" As a whole, the initiative cannot be regarded as a serious legislative proposal and it could not survive any court review if it ever passed. Moreover, unless the initiative becomes backstopped by a whole lot of money, it will never gain the approximately 365,000 voter signatures required to place it on the ballot. Social conservatives would never put any serious money into this project when they have achieved much greater success using the theme of religious freedom, such as Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act. And if on the ballot, it would never pass in a state where LGBT residents of San Francisco are 6.2% of the population and 4.6% of the population of Los Angeles. Following Ockham's Razor, it appears that the initiative was designed to gain a maximum amount of publicity for very low cost, in this case a filing fee of $200. More speculation might turn to discussion of the initiative as a Swiftian satire of social conservative attitudes towards gay society. This modest proposal for interpretation of the author's motives is somewhat diminished by the initiative author's previous failed initiative to use the Bible as a public schools instructional text.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Last updated:   29 March 2015\n    Pusey, Allen.  \"June 26, 2003: Court Overturns Bowers v.

        ],
        "justification": "Curious about how Snopes' writers verify information and craft their stories for public consumption? We've collected some posts that help explain how we do what we do. Happy reading and let us know what else you might be interested in knowing. help explain let us know In January 2022, a widely circulated Facebook post claimed that a person's \"most productive years\" are between the ages of 60 and 80, according to an unreferenced study published in the peer-reviewed and credible research publication New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). As of this writing, the post had received more than 68,000 shares.  Facebook post In addition to similar iterations on social media, Snopes readers also sent our newsroom screengrabs from an email chain with the subject line, The brain of an elderly person that claimed older people have more brilliant brains and achieve more than younger people:    In particular, the post claimed that the most productive age of a person is from 60 to 70 years, that the second most productive human stage is the age from 70 to 80 years old, and that the third most productive time is between the ages of 50 and 60. Before that, the person was said to have not reached his peak.  Therefore, if you are 60, 70 or 80 years old, you are at the best level of your life, claimed the poster.  Snopes dug through the NEJM publications available and were not able to find evidence of such a study having been conducted or published by the journal. To confirm, we reached out to the publication directly and were told that no such article has been published by NEJM.  The NEJM does not use the numbering system cited in the Facebook post [N.Engl.J.Med. 70,389 (2018)], NEJM editorial coordinator Grace Hansen-Dewa told Snopes.  There was neither an issue 70 nor an issue 389 published in 2018, she said, nor were these the page numbers of articles related to the topic. In 2018, the article found on page 70 is Favism and Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency, which begins on page 60. The article found on page 389 is the end of Case 3-2018: A 5-Month-Old Boy with Hypoglycemia, which begins on page 381. Because the study in question never existed, we have rated this claim as False. However, there is scientific work that has been conducted in the past to determine when a person might be most productive.  While there is extensive literature on various life stages and their measures of productivity, each depends on a variety of factors including whether youre looking at physical, mental, emotional, or financial parameters. Without knowing exactly what such parameters were used to make the original poster's case, it is difficult to further determine when a person may be at their peak potential.  Some research finds that the later years may be the best time in a person's life. In a 2015 TedX talk, real estate developer and primary spokesperson for Halftime Institute, Lloyd further argued that there is compelling evidence that the second half of a persons life could be the very best season of life. TedX But there's also evidence arguing the contrary.  In the comments section of a 2019 NEJM Facebook post that featured the issue cited in the misleading claim, several users made mention of the viral post, some of whom shared research they had found to suggest some there may be some truth to a persons better years occurring later in life. 2019 NEJM Facebook post Historians of science have generally concluded that scientific output tends to rise steeply in the twenties and thirties, peak in the late thirties or early forties, and then trail off slowly through later years, wrote one such study published in 2012 to determine how an aging demographic may hold implications for societal productivity. study A commentary published in a 2008 further argued that the determinants of productivity vary by age and their relative importance on measuring productivity at various stages in ones lifetime.  commentary Given that experience has a reasonably strong effect on productivity, the peak productivity potential occurs in ages 35-44, noted the study.  There were some other dubious and somewhat vague claims that we wanted to address from the Facebook post as well, the first being that the average age of dads is 76. It is unclear if at what stage of fatherhood the original poster meant, but a 2017 study published in the journal Human Reproduction found that the average age of a dad at their childs birth is just under 31 years old  and about 1 in 10 fathers will be 40.  Human Reproduction found The claim in question is a great lesson in media literacy, whereby it is important to pay attention to context. For example, the original poster claimed that most Nobel Prize winners were 62, but it does not specify whether that is the age at which they received the prize or the age at which they conducted the work they were awarded for.  The average age of a Nobel Prize laureate, a proxy to study at which age scientist produce their most groundbreaking work, is at least 65 and mostly over 72, according to the BBC. (Prize winners were all also mostly men, which could say more about societal privilege than age itself.) Research conducted in 2010 looked at the age at which invention occurs and found that the average is 39.  average age proxy BBC 2010  Source: Review of Economics and Statistics  Review of Economics and Statistics In short, there are a wide variety of factors that may influence a persons productivity and how one might set about measuring it. While there is some evidence to suggest certain gauges of productivity occur later in life, other research finds that a person may be more productive in other arenas of life at various stages, such as financial earnings, parenthood, or an individual's own measure of productivity.

        "justification": "The tale of the \"bedbug letter,\" in which a complaining business customer receives a seemingly personalized and polite written apology in response to his correspondence  marred by the inadvertent inclusion of crude instructions from a manager to send the recipient \"the standard SOB letter\"  has been a part of contemporary lore since at least the 1920s, as these examples document: [Tunbridge, 1997] I once asked a LAME in Cairns if the tropical climate caused any peculiar aircraft maintenance problems. He thought for a moment and said, \"Yes, cockroaches, because they thrive in all the hidden recesses despite blazing heat on the ground and chilly temperatures in flight, and can really make a mess.\" Then he told me a story about a businessman who woke up some years ago on an international flight only to find a giant cockroach crawling down his cheek. He was so revolted by this that he filled in a complaint form about the incident and sent it off. Some weeks later a letter from the airline's Public Relations Manager landed on his desk. It was an outstanding example of the practitioner's art and convincingly explained the airline's strict precautions against such pests before admitting that, in very rare circumstances, bugs did get on board their airliners, but when they did so, it was always somebody else's fault; the unhygienic dumps they had to land at, or when they had to rely on contractors for servicing, or when carried aboard in passenger's hand luggage. Then to show how repentant the airline was, the PR manager invited the business man to present his letter at check-in when next he flew, when he would be automatically upgraded to first class. After carefully filing the letter, the business man crumpled up the envelope and pitched it into the waste paper basket. As it landed he noticed something inside it. So he retrieved the envelope and withdrew one of the ubiquitous Post-it notes used nowadays to write messages in every office around the globe and apparently enclosed in error by the PR Manager's secretary. It was his instruction to her to, \"Just send this jerk the standard cockroach letter.\"\n [Playboy, 1955] A wealthy gentleman was badly bitten by bugs while riding on a certain railway line. Arriving at his destination, he wrote the company an indignant letter and received a prompt reply. It was, said the letter, the first complaint the company had ever had of this nature. Inquiry had failed to reveal any explanation for this unprecedented occurrence. Nevertheless, a number of new precautions were being taken to make absolutely certain such an unfortunate incident never happened again. The letter was signed by a high official of the railway. The gentleman was well satisfied with this reply and was returning it to the envelope when a slip of paper fell out onto the floor. The hastily scribbled note on it read: \"Send this guy the bug letter.\" [Doyle, 1929] It was a tiring journey to the capital of the Orange Free State and took us just twenty-six hours, so that we were weary folk when late at night on December 1st we found ourselves at Polley's Hotel. Travelling is not luxurious in South Africa  it is leather, not velvet  but all that any reasonable man could wish is to be found. Occasionally there is a plague of insects, but we were not molested much. It is recorded that one traveller, who had been badly bitten, sent a fierce complaint to the management, and received so courteous and conciliatory a letter in reply that he was quite soothed, until by chance a memorandum which was there fell out of the envelope, and he read: \"Send this guy our bug letter.\"\n [The New Yorker, March 1927] Recurrent is the story, or perhaps it is the incident itself, of the gentleman who moved into a new apartment, to discover the presence of water bugs. He immediately dispatched a wrathful letter to the renting agent. In reply he received a lengthy communication in which the agent expressed his deepest grief, his intention of taking up the matter with the owner at once and his assurance that nothing remedial would be left undone. A careless secretary, however, had enclosed a note which read: \"Miss Fraser, send this guy the bug letter.\" Its age notwithstanding, the tale continues to update itself, with overnight travel by Pullman car replaced by long distance journeys by airplane, and paperclipped instructions upgraded to Post-It notes: Variations: Did a real event spark off this legend? Possibly. Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand reported on a 1992 letter from the corresponding secretary of the George Mortimer Pullman Encomium Society in which it was claimed the bed bugging took place on March 4, 1889, to a Mr. Phineas P. Jenkins, a salesman of pig-iron products. After spending a night in the company of far too many bedbugs (which in my book would number \"one\"), Jenkins penned a note of complaint to George M. Pullman, President of the Pullman Palace Car Company. In return, Jenkins supposedly received a wonderfully detailed and heartfelt apology from Pullman. Its effect was undermined, however, by the enclosure of his original letter, across which Pullman had handwritten \"Sarah  Send this S! O! B! the 'bedbug letter.'\" An interesting related incident was recorded as a news story in November 2000: Ian Payne wrote the BBC to request a season of Jean Simmons films and the autograph of Lorraine Heggessey. He received back a short letter saying the BBC could not consider a Simmons season at this time, and attached to the letter was a Post-It note reading: \"Nutter, polite fob off  no autograph.\" Whether the BBC actually sent Mr. Payne a letter with the described Post-It note attached (or whether the incident was contrived by the recipient or someone else in a case of pseudo-ostension) was never settled, as the BBC maintained it was unable to identify a possible culprit: \"We have apologised unreservedly to Mr. Payne. We have tried to find out who wrote the post it note and we have compared the handwriting from the officers and we cannot find anybody's handwriting who matches it. We are mystified at this.\" pseudo-ostension Another similar incident took place in September 2013, when a Seattle woman named Erin Boudreau e-mailed customer support at Postmates to complain about a service issue. Ms. Boudreau said she received a response (which she posted on Twitter) that included crudely-phrased instructions from Postmates CEO Bastian Lehmann about how her complaint should be handled: Postmates posted  (Twitter screenshot) Mr. Lehmann subsequently posted an apologetic blog entry in which he referred to his message as a \"bad joke\": Last night I sent a private e-mail to our Customer Service team in response to a customer complaint regarding her past orders and restaurant profile. My e-mail, which outlined how to resolve the customer issue, contained a bad joke which was very poor in taste. Subsequently, the bad joke was sent to the customer. What I said was a major lapse in judgement on my part. I deeply regret this.I immediately reached out to the customer and offered my full and sincere apology. I would like to extend that same apology to all of our customers and Customer Service team. There is no excuse for this. Though this is not quite the bedbug story (a recurrent condition was not being passed off as a one-time occurrence), the element of a customer's written communication being responded to with a polite letter marred by the inclusion of a \"send this gal a fob off note\" (thus revealing the real sentiments behind the response) is close to it. In July 2014 a redditor posted an image of apology letter sent by United Airlines in response to a complaint, showing that the letter was a template and the sender had neglected to customize the appropriate fields: apology letter  Braude, Jacob M.Complete Speaker's and Toastmaster's Library: Business and Professional Pointmakers.Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1965 (p. 282).

        "justification": "Claim:  Claire Braz-Valentine wrote and read  \"An Open Letter to John Ashcroft\" at Cabrillo College. \nStatus:  True.\n Example:  [Collected via e-mail, 2005] \n\n\nThis poem was written and read at the Santa Cruz Celebration of The Muse at Cabrillo College in 2002. The evening is a benefit for survivors of breast cancer.  AN OPEN LETTER TO JOHN ASCROFT, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES  On January 28, 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft, announced that he spent $8000 of taxpayer's money for drapes to cover up the exposed breast of The Spirit of Justice, an 18ft aluminum statue of a woman that stands in the Hall of Justice.  John, John, John,\nyou've got your priorities all wrong.\nWhile men fly airplanes into skyscrapers,\ndive bomb the pentagon,\nwhile they stick explosives into their shoes,\nand then book a seat right next to us,\nwhile they hide knives in their luggage,\nsteal kids on school buses,\ntake little girls from their beds at night\ndrive trucks into our state capital buildings,\nwhile our president calls dangerous men all over the world\nevildoers and devils,\nwhile we live in the threat of biological warfare\nnuclear destruction,\nannihilation,\nyou are out buying yardage\nto save Americans\nfrom the appalling\nalarming, abominable\naluminum alloy of evil,\nthat terrible ten foot tin tittie.\nYou might not be able to find Bin Laden\nBut you sure as hell found the hooter in the hall of justice.  It's not that we aren't grateful\nBut while we were begging the women of Afghanistan\nto not cover up their faces,\nyou are begging your staff members to\njust cover up that nipple,\nto save the American people\nfrom that monstrous metal mammary.\nHow can we ever thank you?  So, in your office every morning,\nin your secret prayer meeting,\nwhile an American woman is sexually assaulted every 6 seconds,\nwhile anthrax floats around the post office,\nand settles in the chest of senior citizens,\nyou've got another chest on your mind.\nWhile American sons arrive home in body bags\nand heat seeking missiles,\nfly around a foreign country,\nlooking for any warm body,\nyou think of another body.\nAnd you pray for the biggest bra in the world John,\nbecause you see that breast on the spirit of justice\nin the spirit of your\nown inhibited sexuality.\nAnd when we women see\nour grandmothers, our mothers, our daughters, our granddaughters,\nour sisters, ourselves,\nwhen we women see that\nstatue the spirit of justice\nwe see the spirit of strength\nthe spirit of survival.\nWhile every day\nwe view innocent bodies dragged out of rubble\nand women and children laid out\nlike thin limp dolls\nand baptized into death as collateral damage,\nand the hollow eyed Afghani mother's milk has dried\nup underneath her burka,\nin famine, in shame,\nand her children are dead at her breast.  While you look at that breast John,\nthat jug on the spirit of justice,\nand deal with your thoughts of lust,\nand sex, and nakedness,\nwe see it as a testimony motherhood,\nAnd you see it as a tit.  It's not the money it cost.\nIt's the message you send.\nWe've got the right to live in freedom.\nWe got the right to cheat Americans out\nof millions of dollars and then\njust not want to tell congress about it.\nWe've got the right\nto drop bombs night and day\non a small country that has no army,\nno navy, no military at all,\nbecause we've got the right to bear arms\nbut we just better not even think\nabout not the right to bare breasts.\nSo now John, you can be photographed\nwhile you stand there and talk about\nguns,and bombs, and poisons,\nwithout the breast appearing over your right shoulder,\nwithout that bodacious bosom bothering you,\nand we just wanted to tell you,\nin the spirit of justice,\nin the spirit of truth,\nJohn,\nthere is still one very big boob left standing there in that picture.  Claire Braz-Valentine\n Origins:  The issue at the heart of this piece is two Art Deco sculptures which have stood in the Great Hall of the Department of Justice since that headquarters building opened in 1936.  Commissioned from German sculptor C. Paul Jennewein, the pair of 12-1/2 foot statues represent the Spirit of Justice and the Majesty of the Law: the former is a female figure draped in a toga, with raised arms and one exposed breast; the   latter is a male figure with a draped cloth covering his midsection. Press photographers over the years had sometimes taken advantage of the positioning of the statues to snap \"boob in front of the boob\" shots (such as a notorious photo of Edwin Meese, Attorney General during President Reagan's second term, holding a report on pornography aloft with the partially nude female statue visible behind him).   After John Ashcroft, the Attorney General during President George W. Bush's first term, was captured by press cameramen in similar shots, the media reported in January 2002 that Ashcroft had ordered (or approved) the Department of Justice's spending of $8,650 for drapes to hide the two statues because he didn't like being photographed in front of them (or, worse, that Ashcroft was a embarrassingly prudish Philistine who was offended by any representation of nudity).  Department of Justice spokespersons maintained that the drapes were used not to hide the statues but to  \"provide a nice background for television cameras\" during formal events; that the purchase had been made by a DoJ staffer on her own initiative to save the $2,000 per event cost of renting them; and that \"the attorney general was not even aware of the situation.\"  Critics held that the DoJ's disputing the issue of who actually authorized the purchase of the drapes was a smoke screen (since rental drapes were already being used to cover the statues); that the drapes were left hanging all the time and were not put in place only when televised events were being held in the Great Hall; and that even if Attorney General Ashcroft didn't know about or authorize the purchase, he certainly didn't order the drapes removed, either:  Whatever the truth of the \"Drapegate\" incident, poet, playwright, and journalist Claire Braz-Valentine used the issue as the basis for her poem quoted above, \"An Open Letter to John Ashcroft,\" which she read (to much laughter) at the 2002 \"In Celebration of the Muse,\" an annual poetry event at held Cabrillo College in Santa Cruz, California.  A transcription of her poem began making the rounds of the Internet shortly afterwards (although somewhere along the way someone took the title a bit too literally and formatted the text as if it were an actual letter). Claire Braz-Valentine A QuickTime video of Ms. Braz-Valentine reading her poem at Cabrillo College can be viewed at the link below. Update: John Ashcroft stepped down as Attorney General after the 2004 elections, and President Bush selected Alberto R. Gonzales as his replacement.  On 24 June 2005, the blue drapes were quietly removed from the Great Hall, once again revealing the sculptures which had been hidden behind them for more than three years.  According to a Department of Justice spokesman, the decision to remove the drapes was made by Paul Corts, assistant attorney general for administration, and Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales \"agreed with the recommendation.\" Additional information: \n  \n\n An Open Letter to John Ashcroft  (Claire Braz-Valentine)\n\n   Last updated:  25 June 2005\n  \n\n\n  Sources:\n\n   Eggen, Dan.  \"Sculpted Bodies and a Strip Act at Justice Dept.\"\n   The Washington Post.  25 June 2005  (p.

Through the latter half of 2021, one such claim suggested that Japanese health officials touted ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug that has been at the heart of contentious treatment conspiracies, as an effective therapeutic. In turn, rumors claimed that Japan had as a result nixed rollout of its vaccine program by October 2021.  The claim dates back to at least August 2021 when Dr. Haruo Ozaki, the chairman of the Tokyo Metropolitan Medical Association, reportedly recommended the use of ivermectin.  August 2021 Dr. Haruo Ozaki reportedly recommended  And it recirculated again in late October 2021, when the rumor was described in an Oct. 27 episode of the Hal Turner Radio Show  a broadcast that floats conspiracy theories  titled, Japan drops vax rollout, goes to Ivermectin, ENDS COVID almost overnight.  Oct. 27 episode Hal Turner Radio Show Japan drops vax rollout, goes to Ivermectin, ENDS COVID almost overnight By far, however, the absolute superstar among foreign nations dealing with COVID is Japan. Japan has PULLED the vaccines and substituted Ivermectin - and in one month, wiped COVID out in that country! wrote Turner on the radio blog. As a result, publications like the pseudo-science website Natural News ran headlines such as, Japan ends vaccine-induced pandemic by legalizing IVERMECTIN, while pharma-controlled media pretends masks and vaccines were the savior.  Japan ends vaccine-induced pandemic by legalizing IVERMECTIN, while pharma-controlled media pretends masks and vaccines were the savior But as other reputable fact-checking publications, including The Associated Press and PolitiFact, have reported, this claim is false. Japan has neither halted its vaccine program, nor has the country unilaterally stated that ivermectin is an approved or authorize treatment for COVID-19.  The Associated Press PolitiFact However, it is true that Ozaki is credited with saying, to some extent, that more attention should be given to ivermectin as a potential treatment. During a news briefing on Feb. 9, he suggested that doctors should be allowed to prescribe off-label ivermectin and the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone. On Aug. 23, he said that it was necessary to thoroughly study the clinical trials, but it seems that we are at a stage where it is okay to have the patient get an informed consent, and get permission to use it. Feb. 9 Aug. 23 Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic treatment approved in the U.S. for the treatment of certain external parasites like head lice, and as an oral tablet called Stromectol to treat some parasitic roundworm infections.

Studies in the cultured cells of fetal pigs showed that ivermectin may be effective in preventing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in petri dishes  not humans. It shows promise, but it is too early to claim that the drug is either an effective cure or treatment, or that it will become one soon. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and its Center for Veterinary Medicine have publicly expressed concern over people who may self-medicate with ivermectin intended for animals.  cultured cells of fetal pigs Center for Veterinary Medicine publicly expressed At the time of this writing, there is no approved or authorized use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 in the U.S, and that extends to Japan as well. A look at the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan showed that ivermectin is still not an approved medical product for COVID-19 (what has been approved as of November 2021 was Remdesivir, Baricitinib, Casirivimab, and Sotrovimab.)  approved medical product This isnt to entirely rule out the potential for ivermectin use in the future. A review published in the Journal of Antibiotics that analyzed decades of research concluded that the anti-parasitic drug could serve as a potential candidate in the treatment of a wide range of viruses including COVID-19. By and large, experts agree that a decision surrounding the application and prescribing of ivermectin depend on further clinical testing to determine whether it is both safe and effective in human patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.  depend Its also not true that Japan stopped its vaccine rollout. A look at the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare website showed that COVID-19 vaccination is not only still rolling, but it is free for all residents of the nation. As of this writing, three vaccines were available in Japan: Comirnaty (previously Pfizer), Moderna, and AstraZeneca. Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare available While Japan has not wiped out COVID-19, it was touted as a pandemic success story in mid-October following a significant drop in cases. pandemic success Almost overnight, Japan has become a stunning, and somewhat mysterious, coronavirus success story, wrote The AP on Oct. 18. Daily new COVID-19 cases have plummeted from a mid-August peak of nearly 6,000 in Tokyo, with caseloads in the densely populated capital now routinely below 100, an 11-month low. wrote  Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare  Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare   But that success is credited largely to a remarkably rapid vaccination campaign and a culture of hygienic measures, public sanitization campaigns, and mask-wearing. As a report published on Oct. 1 said, 1.6 million people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, or about 1.3% of the population.

            "The 'real McCoy' refers to a type of automatic oiler invented by a black man?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  The \"real McCoy\" refers to a type of automatic oiler invented by a black man. FALSE Examples:  \n[Collected via e-mail, February 2000] Railroading was vital to the development of our economy and culture in the 19th century.  An example: the real McCoy refers to McCoys automated oilier and not his many imitators that where not nearly as good.\n \n [Collected via e-mail, April 2005] Curiously, an invention left off [a list of black inventors] is perhaps the most distinctive of its kind, the McCoy Automatic Lubricator (US Pat #129,843).  Elijah McCoy invented an entirely new class of machinery improvement, being the very first time a railroad locomotive could be continuously lubricated while in motion.  Variations were used on virtually every steam locomotive built since.  The McCoy device was so popular that a number of inferior knockoffs appeared on the market - leading master mechanics of the railroads to specify the genuine article - the \"Real McCoy.\"\n Origins:  While most folks instinctively grasp the meaning of the phrase \"the real McCoy\" (the genuine article, as opposed to an imitation), no one has the definitive answer as to where that peculiar expression came from. There are a number of competing theories as to who or what was \"the real McCoy\": \n Elijah McCoy, inventor of a device that lubricated the moving parts of a railway locomotive, or his invention itself.  Someone from the Hatfield-McCoy family feud of the 1880s.   Products of the Nelson McCoy Pottery company in Ohio.  Booze supplied by Prohibition-era rum-runner named Bill McCoy, whose product was said to always be of the highest quality.  Joseph G. McCoy, the cattleman who laid out the Chisholm Trail.   A Pennsylvania wildcatter of the name of McCoy who diverted nitroglycerin from job sites to safecrackers, who in turn dubbed the explosives he supplied \"the real McCoy\" (to distinguish them from the homemade less reliable concoctions they sometimes used).  Mrs. McCoy of a 19th century Irish ballad wherein she thrashes her husband, thereby proving herself \"the real McCoy.\"  The products of a British pharmaceutical company that were much in demand by addicts in the U.S. after passage of the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914, with the appellation spreading to any commercially produced drug product (to differentiate it from blackmarket drugs of dubious origin).  Arising from rivalry among branches of the Mackay clan in Scotland as to which was the most valid, with the name of one clan's leader (Reay Mackay) over time morphing into \"real McCoy.\"  A corruption of \"the real Macao,\" slang for pure heroin, the best of which supposedly came from Macao.  A corruption of \"the real McKay,\" a slogan used to advertise the products of whisky distillers A & M McKay of Glasgow.  American welterweight champion Norman Selby, known as Kid McCoy.\n The saying's recorded history is murky, but while there is no indisputable origin for the term, one theory (which actually combines two of the above elements) does stand far above the rest. While the earliest verified print sighting of \"the real McCoy\" dates to 1908, the first surfacing of the phrase it likely stemmed from was noted in 1856: \"A drappie o' the real McKay,\" referring to a brand of whisky produced in Scotland. Said brand of hooch subsequently came to be advertised under the slogan \"the real McKay\" in 1870, thereby exposing an even greater number of Scots to its existence. Over time, other sightings into which misspellings had crept were noted:  \n 1865: The ceremony being concluded, Bacchus was worshipped to a most satisfactory extent - the supply of \"the real MacKay\" being unlimited - capital in quality, and accompanied with tempting viands.  1908: I took a good-size snort out of that big bottle [of furniture polish] in the middle.... Have you none of the clear McCoy handy around the house? (The item being described as \"McCoy\" in this sighting was whisky.)  1934: There's something very attractive about the real McKie when you meet it.\n These two points (misspellings creeping in plus the first McCoy sighting being about whisky) somewhat work to support the theory that the Scottish advertising slogan \"the real McKay\" became a tad garbled as it crossed the ocean into the U.S.   Yet however it got there, once it had arrived in the new land, it subsequently came to be associated with a boxer of some fame, thereby greatly increasing its spread. Norman Selby, better known  Norman Selby as Kid McCoy, was the American welterweight champion in 1896. As he gained weight, he moved up into the middleweight class, and during his career fought many notable heavyweights. Selby's life outside the ring was every bit as interesting as it was within it: he was married eight times (thrice to the same woman), served a nine-year prison sentence for the murder of a married lover, and ended his life by his own hand.  It is not known how he came by his \"Kid McCoy\" sobriquet. (Another nickname attached to him was \"The Corkscrew Kid,\" in reference to his signature \"corkscrew\" punch.) But however he came by the McCoy handle, he did fight under it.  An apocryphal tale ties Norman Selby to the origin of  \"the real McCoy.\" By its lights, he encountered a drunk in a bar who was skeptical of his claims to be the great fighter Kid McCoy. The boxer settled all doubt with one punch that flattened the sot. Upon regaining his feet, the now thoroughly convinced lush loudly announced to all present that the one who'd decked him was \"the real McCoy.\"  Similarly, another legend states that McCoy had so many imitators that he eventually had to bill himself as Kid \"The Real\" McCoy. No reason exists to believe either tale; they appear more fanciful lore than anything else. However, the boxer's fame likely contributed to the popularity of the expression, as potentially did the fame of another pugilist who bore the actual surname: Al McCoy, middleweight title holder from 1914 to 1917.  That's the long way around to this most likely of explanations of the origin of \"the real McCoy\": a Scottish whisky slogan came to the U.S., with its \"McKay\" becoming \"McCoy\" in the process, with the saying subsequently further popularized through confusion between a popular boxer of the day (Kid McCoy) and the saying (the real McCoy). Of the many other potential origins for the phrase, while some contain elements that are rooted in history (there was a black inventor by name of Elijah McCoy who did invent a revolutionary device that allowed for the oiling of machines while in operation, and there was a famous cattle baron of the name of Joseph G. McCoy), most are not. If addicts ever referred to heroin as \"the real Macao,\" we've yet to encounter an instance of it. Likewise, there's little reason to suppose that a Pennsylvania wildcatter named McCoy was selling nitroglycerin swiped from job sites to safecrackers.  Nelson McCoy Pottery wasn't founded until 1910 which, given the 1908 \"real McCoy\" sighting, puts it out of the running. 1910 Of the three less credible purported explanations that involve real people, although there was a famous cattle baron called Joseph G. McCoy, it's unlikely he was confused with anyone else, thereby requiring him to self-identify as \"the real McCoy.\" Joseph G. McCoy Likewise, while the oiler invented by Elijah McCoy amounted to a startling development in its time, it does not appear to have been competing with copycats, thereby leaving buyers clamoring for \"the real McCoy.\" Also, it was a specialized piece of equipment, which means its pool of potential purchasers was very small. It is therefore not believable that widespread consumer insistence upon having the McCoy oiler and no other created the phrase. Elijah McCoy Similarly, while there was a Prohibition-era rum runner named Bill McCoy, even if the booze he had been vending had been of the highest quality, he could not have been the McCoy celebrated in the saying, given that the line has been documented back to 1908, whereas Prohibition did not begin in the U.S. until 1920. Bill McCoy For the saying to not only have taken root but survived for more than a century, it had to have caught the public's imagination in its infancy rather than been merely a catchphrase within a small specialized area. A phrase first recorded as used in reference to whisky in 1856 then enshrined as a particular brand of firewater's official slogan in 1870 fits the bill in ways the other proffered explanations do not, especially if it were given a further boost via being confused with the nickname of a well-known boxer in its new homeland.

        ],
        "justification": "Clean coal, a broad term for technology that can reduce the environmental impact of burning coal, has become a popular political buzzword in the past two U.S. presidential campaigns. To those who promote it, clean coal is a third way that will allow humans to continue to mine and burn that form of fossil fuel in a more responsible way, obviating the need for regulations on the coal industry or heavy investment in green energy. To detractors, it is an expensive marketing ploy selling an unrealized and unrealistic fantasy. marketing ploy Humans have used coal as fuel for at least 4000 years. A combustible rock formed from the chemical transformation of organic plant matter over hundreds of millions of years of burial, coal is a relatively cheap and easy source of energy. Its widespread use powered the industrial revolution, and coal-burning power plants currently provide 33% of all household energy in the States. 4000 years power plants But for as long as coal has been an energy source, it has been plagued by environmental issues. Burning coal produces hazardous acid rain and irritating particulate matter, and it releases climate-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. plagued From a global warming standpoint, burning coal is significantly worse than burning other fossil fuels, as its chemistry allows for the production of more CO2 per reaction, as discussed in a December 2010 Atlantic article about clean coal technology: article Compared with most other fossil-fuel sources of energy, coal is inherently worse from a carbon-footprint perspective, since its hydrogen atoms come bound with more carbon atoms, meaning that coal starts with a higher carbon-to-hydrogen ratio than oil, natural gas, or other hydrocarbons. This situation is especially unfortunate for the United States, since the country has large domestic reserves of cheap coal, and because many local economies depend on coal mining jobs that could be lost if regulations were to make coal economically unfeasible. The intersection of these environmental and economic concerns has made coal mining and energy a polarizing political issue in the United States. domestic reserves Clean coal is not a special type of coal, nor is it a new technology that reduces the environmental impact of coal mining. Instead, it refers to technology used to clean up the emissions from burning coal after it has already been burned for energy, or technology used to treat coal just prior to being burned. In the context of global warming, the main technology that is cited is carbon capture, utilization and sequestration, defined on the U.S. Department of Energy web site thusly: defined Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), also referred to as carbon capture, utilization and sequestration, is a process that captures carbon dioxide emissions from sources like coal-fired power plants and either reuses or stores it so it will not enter the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide storage in geologic formations includes oil and gas reservoirs, unmineable coal seams and deep saline reservoirs -- structures that have stored crude oil, natural gas, brine and carbon dioxide over millions of years. The term clean coal was first used by the US Department of Energy (DOE) in 1980s during an initiative they sponsored to demonstrate the commercial viability of technology that could scrub acid-rain creating toxins from the emissions of coal burning. At the time of the initiative, acid rain was the primary environmental concern, and greenhouse gases were an afterthought: afterthought The early program, however, was focused on the environmental challenges of the time  primarily concerns over the impact of acid rain on forests and watersheds. In the 21st century, additional environmental concerns have emerged  the potential health impacts of trace emissions of mercury, the effects of microscopic particles on people with respiratory problems, and the potential global climate-altering impact of greenhouse gases. The term was, in effect, rebranded in 2007 by an industry-funded group called the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, who were concerned about the prospect of increased coal regulations under an Obama presidency. They made the term clean coal a household name through a 30 million dollar public relations campaign touting the benefits of clean coal technology. campaign  The problem, though, is that from the standpoint of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the technology (for all practical purposes) does not yet exist on a scale that could be considered at all meaningful. In terms of carbon capture, utilization and sequestration technology, the only projects underway in the United States are pilot studies. These are not viable on larger scale, as the DOE admits: technology admits Today, there are commercially available First Generation CO2 capture technologies that are being used in various small-scale industrial applications. At their current state of development these technologies are not ready for widespread deployment on fossil fuel based power plants [...]. Furthermore, there are a number of barriers to the successful implementation of carbon capture technology at coal-burning power plants, as discussed in a report by the British humanitarian think tank the Overseas Development Institute. First, the pace and scale of carbon capture technology is unlikely to overcome its limitations in a time period that would have any relevance to reducing atmospheric CO2: report Essentially, coal-powered CCS has yet to be technologically proven as planned even at a quarter-scale. With per-plant investments running to the billions, this stepping-stone from laboratory to full commercial rollout of just the first phase of coal-powered CCS plants is incredibly important and getting past it is going to take years. Although the industry might argue that it is close, it has clearly not yet refined an off-the-shelf product. The investment and time needed to build, test, and learn from projects to reduce costs means that CCS for coal power will not be ready to be commercially deployed at scale for at least a decade. Second, implementation of CCS makes the cost of coal too high to be competitive, and it reduces its output by consuming energy from the power plant trying to sell that energy: To capture CO2 at a power station requires adding a large separation unit, which also requires a significant amount of power to run. Adding the extra process currently doubles the capital costs of a plant, while running the separation process effectively decreases the overall efficiency of the plant by around a quarter. This efficiency penalty means that only the most efficient coal plant (advanced coal) can feasibly be used with CCS. Together these mean that adding CCS to a coal-fired plant will make the electricity it produces substantially more expensive than both conventional and advanced current coal plants. These problems were made plainly visible by a recent pilot study of a coal-burning power plant in Canadas Saskatchewan province that used a nearby hydroelectric dam to power the separation of CO2 from its exhaust. Though early reports painted a rosy picture, a March 2016 New York Times article suggested that the system was affected by a number of critical problems: article Known as SaskPowers Boundary Dam 3, the project has been plagued by multiple shutdowns, has fallen way short of its emissions targets, and faces an unresolved problem with its core technology. The costs, too, have soared, requiring tens of millions of dollars in new equipment and repairs. At the outset, its economics were dubious, said Cathy Sproule, a member of Saskatchewans legislature who released confidential internal documents about the project. Now theyre a disaster. This is not to say that research into minimizing the effect of the emissions from coal burning is necessarily futile. As discussed in a 2010 Atlantic article, there are two arguments to be made in favor of funding clean coal technology: article One is that coal can be used in less damaging, more sustainable ways than it is now. The other is that it must be used in those ways, because there is no plausible other way to meet what will be, absent an economic or social cataclysm, the worlds unavoidable energy demands. The latler argument is a staple of the pro-coal camp, who argue that, like it or not, we are going to have to use coal in the future to supply energy for our country. So why not try to make it cleaner in the process? staple The push against that argument is well summarized by a comment made by Mary Finley-Brook, a professor of geography, environmental studies and international studies at the University of Richmond in Virginia, to the science news website Live Science: Live Science \"Clean coal does not currently exist,\" Finley-Brook wrote in an email. \"It will be expensive to develop and is uncertain (unlikely) to work, depending on what technology is selected. This is moving in the wrong direction from a climate change mitigation perspective. We need energy transition away from fossil fuels, not nice-sounding names to confuse people who don't know better.\" Regardless of ones view on the philosophical debate about spending money to clean a technology we may begrudgingly have to use for years to come, the fact is that currently, so-called \"clean coal\" technology can for now do nothing to reduce carbon emissions on any appreciable or significant scale.",

            "Are St. Bernard dogs being raised for food in China?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  St. Bernard dogs are being raised for food in China. TRUE Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2001] \nPETITION TO STOP THE EXPORT OF ST BERNARD DOGS TO ASIA AS TABLE MEAT St. Bernard dogs are being exported to Asia (China, Phillipines, etc) as table meat. Some of these dogs are first tortured to increase their adrenaline levels BECAUSE IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS MAKES THE MEAT TASTE SWEETER, then skinned alive. These animals are being killed because their meat is considered to be an aphrodisiac. This is an absolutely abhorrent practice and WILL STOP NOW! PLEASE, sign this Petition which, will be forwarded to the United Nations asking that they intervene. New Zealand was successful in stopping the experimentation on the Great Apes We can all, as a world nation, do the same for our pets. Thank you.           PETITION TO STOP THE EXPORT OF ST BERNARD DOGS TO ASIA AS TABLE MEAT We the undersigned ask that the United Nations intervene on behalf of the people of the world to stop this abhorrent treatment of all dogs and to stop countries exporting/importing dogs for the purpose of either breeding for food or using for food. St Bernard dogs are popular for this practice as the puppies grow to a large size quickly.\n Origins:  News reports from and about China are notoriously difficult to verify, and given the size and diversity of China's population, any statement about what   \"Chinese people do\" has to be taken with a grain of salt.  Several European newspapers and news agencies have run items in recent weeks about the raising of St. Bernard dogs for food in China, although newspapers often pick up stories from each other without verifying the information (and thus all report the same apocryphal story as true, as recently happened with the Working Stiff legend).  Some of these papers carried stories filed by reporters in Beijing itself, which gives them a bit more credibility, but even these reporters seem to have been relaying information they were told rather than scenes they personally witnessed.  Nonetheless, we're cautiously assuming the basic facts found in the reports are true, based on the sheer persistence of the reports. Working Stiff The main thrust of the articles is that some 11,000 signatures have been collected by a group in Switzerland known as the SOS St Bernard Dogs in order to prod the Swiss government into lodging a formal protest with China, and the validity of the protest is supported with various quotes and scenes gathered from around China: \n\nIn Datong, where coal was once the biggest business, sacked miners now make money cross-breeding pure St Bernards with local mutts that are reared solely for the stovetop. \"The meat is so tender and has a unique aroma,\" said Meng Li, a local breeder.\n \n The fame of gently braising St Bernhard in oyster sauce or pot roast with aromatic vegetables has reached Beijing. At the Gourou Wang restaurant in a suburb of the capital - the name means Dog Meat King - St Bernard is in hot demand. \"Dog fondue is the most asked after dish,\" said a spokesman. \"It really warms you up.\"\n \n On the public broadcasting system recently Professor Du Shaoyue said: \"This is meat from an idle dog. They are very tasty and very nutritious.\"  The film accompanying his voiceover shows little St Bernard pups playing in the grass\nwhile a female narrator, then cuts over romantic piano music as the \"growth qualities\" of the breed are extolled.\n \n Song Shiyong, head of the Shenyang Dog Meat Research Institute said St Bernard were four times more profitable to breed than pigs or chickens. \"This is a new way to prosperity,\"  The  Central Garrison Bureau, which is responsible for the wellbeing and security of President Jiang Zemin and other leaders, is a regular customer at a dog farm that specialises in the breeding of St Bernards for meat production. A spokesman for the Beijing Academy of Agricultural Science said: \"The Central Garrison Bureau buys up to 30 St Bernards for the dining pleasure of the leaders.\"  The Swiss dogs, which have been imported for mass breeding, weigh up to 200lb each and their meat costs about 4 per pound, according to the academy. A 1lb St Bernard meat dish feeds about five people and is usually prepared with soy sauce or oyster sauce. The tail, the liver and the paws are often served separately.\n \n A brochure published by the Shenyang Agriculture and Science Development Institute, in the far northeastern province of Liaoning, praised the St Bernards' \"high farrowing rate\", its \"fine and tasty\" meat and noted that its \"gentle disposition is good for group breeding\". Returns from meat dog farming were four times higher than from pig farming, the brochure added.\n One reporter found that Chinese claims about the savory aspects of dog meat didn't quite meet his expectations: \n\nThe Beijing academy spokesman said: \"The taste of St Bernard meat is somewhere between ordinary beef and tenderloin  much better than other dog meat, which is often hard to chew.\"  This description does not quite match what I found during a meal this week at Beijing's Dog Meat King restaurant. Groups of businessmen feasted in private rooms with karaoke video machines at the head of the table.  Waitresses placed two menus in front of me, a regular one and a dog meat menu. The dog meat was not labelled as coming from Switzerland but the waitresses assured me that the Dog Meat King uses only the best type of meat, which I assumed to mean St Bernards.  The dishes on offer cost between 3 and 9 and included stewed dog meat with soy sauce, dog ribs, stewed paws and tail with ginseng. I opted for dog meat boiled in soup.  In retrospect, I would say that it tasted a bit like Irish beef stew but at the time it seemed more like a wet, crumbling digestive biscuit.\n Two of the points often mentioned  that the dogs \"are sometimes subjected to a painful death because breeders believe that the resulting adrenalin rush improves the flavour\" (or because this supposedly enhances the aphrodisiacal qualities of the meat) and that St Bernards are being imported into China in large numbers  are more difficult to verify.  The St. Bernard is supposedly the preferred dog in China because it yields a better-tasting and more economical source of meat than other breeds, and it doesn't make much economic sense to go to all the expense of importing thousands of dogs from other countries when breeders could simply raise them much more cheaply themselves. Still, though the idea of someone's eating St. Bernards (or any other type of dog) may be abhorrent to us, it's also rather hypocritical of us to demand that it stop.  Even if the Chinese are eating dogs, why is that any different than our eating lamb, for example?  Would America react with anything but scorn if Hindus around the world presented the U.S. with a petition demanding that we stop the \"abhorrent practice\" of eating cows and exporting beef?  Nonetheless, hypocrisy seems to be the typical stance of much of the world: \n\nAnimal welfare organizations, like the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), are outraged that Saint Bernards are being bred for their meat and have petitioned the Chinese government to introduce its first animal cruelty laws. \"If a Chinese cannot understand why Swiss people get so upset that they are eating St Bernards, I would ask that same question: If Swiss people eat China's panda, how would Chinese feel?\" Grace Ge Gabriel, IFAW China director, told Reuters Television.\n\n We suspect that if pandas were as plentiful (and edible) as dogs, the Chinese would already be eating them.  But of course, their standards don't count, only ours do. Certainly most of us prefer that any animals used for food be raised and killed humanely, but we don't have to look to China to find exceptions to this standard  there are plenty of cows, chickens, pigs, and other food animals being raised and slaughtered in appalling fashion right here in our own backyard.  But of course, since we keep dogs as pets, we arrogantly assume we have the moral right to tell the rest of the world what they can do with their dogs.  Why worry about the suffering of millions of our own livestock and poultry animals if we can beat up on somebody else for daring to eat dogs?  As usual, the issue isn't really about the right of all animals to be treated humanely; it's only about the right of a small subset of cute and endearing animals to be treated humanely.

            "Is Marlboro owned by the KKK?"
        ],
        "justification": "Claim:  Marlboro is owned by the KKK. FALSE Origins:  Rumors about markings on the Marlboro package indicating Ku Klux Klan ownership have been in circulation at least since the mid-1980s. By 1989 these slanders had become so widespread that they were well known even in France and England. Which markings indicates Klan ownership vary, depending upon whom you hear the rumor from: \n The red chevroning on the white background is often cited is as forming the two jutting arms of the capital letter \"K\" when the pack is tipped on its side. Given that the chevroning appears on three surfaces of the pack (front and back plus one of the sides  the one carrying the Surgeon General's warning has no room for additional styling), one could \"read\" three Ks on the pack, resulting in \"KKK\", the abbreviated name of the Ku Klux Klan. The two horses on the Marlboro crest also come in for comment. When viewed upside-down, the positioning of their forelegs could be taken for a hand gesture known in the United States as the \"V for Victory\" or \"Peace\" symbol (depending on which generation one hails from). This \"victory\" symbol is read by those looking for proof of Klan involvement as a symbol of Klan triumph. (Be careful with flashing that gesture abroad  in England, delivering it with the palm faced inwards towards the signaler's body means \"Up Yours!\")  Some who look between the horses legs see two hooded Klansmen carrying the motto banner. The \"Veni, Vidi, Vici\" motto emblazoned on the banner is believed by some to be the motto of the Ku Klux Klan. (Evidently, they'd never heard of Julius Caesar.) The final five letters of Marlboro are \"lboro.\" Reverse them to get \"orobl,\" a fragment conspiracy theorists claim is meant to be read as \"horrible.\" Turning \"Marlboro\" upside-down and reading the first three letters backwards results in \"jeW\" (the upside-down \"r\" looks like a \"j\"). All together, this decoding results in \"horrible jew.\" (Why, precisely, the phrase \"horrible jew\" is supposed to indicate ties to the KKK as opposed to general anti-semitism is never explained.) Tearing open the bottom of the pack in a certain way was rumored to reveal the head of a hooded Klansman, with two spots (one black, one gold) on the package serving as the Klansman's eyes. (The two spots were actually common printers' proofs for colors used on packaging. They don't appear on current packs, however, as Philip Morris has done away with them.)\n Marlboro is the flagship tobacco product of the Philip Morris Company. There is no evidence that PMC is or was ever owned by the Ku Klux Klan,   even back in its early days when it was still possible for individuals to own enough of the company to have any sort of a say in how it was run. PMC has no need to fear doing its laundry in public, sheets and all. One has to wonder at the basic premise of the whisper. Even if the KKK did own a business (and in the world of specious rumor the list of companies it's supposed to control is endless), why would it be fool enough to advertise the fact, even by way of coded references worked into package design? A huge public backlash would be risked against no potential gain, and that makes no sense. Were such ownership to come to light, whatever firm the KKK ran would be immediately boycotted, lose its customer base in the blink of an eye, and have to shut its door forever shortly thereafter. If there's one sure death knell a company could sound, it would be to announce it's owned by the Ku Klux Klan. Okay, so the rumor fails the common sense test. Why is it so popular, then? Everyone likes to think he's been let in on a secret, and that is perhaps what lies at the heart of this bit of lore. That the rumor itself is ridiculous doesn't interfere with that special frisson of knowing something others have yet to catch on to. Besides, everyone knows cigarettes are bad for you and the companies who profit from flogging them are evil  why not combine both elements with the KKK, one of the few groups in existence worthy of being paired off with them? According to lore, PMC's founder, Philip Morris, was a Klan member, which is supposedly how Marlboro fell into the hands of the KKK. Truth is, Morris was a London tobacco shop owner in the 1850s. In 1902 this British manufacturer set up a corporation in New York to sell its British brands, including Philip Morris, Blues, Cambridge, Derby, and one named after the street its London factory was on, Marlborough. (Heh. So much for that \"orobl jew\"  theory.) (A similar KKK rumor circulates about Richard Joshua Reynolds, founder of Reynolds Tobacco, the firm which produces Camels. That too is untrue, although Reynolds was a native of Virginia, which at least would make a bit more sense than trying to pin KKK membership on a London shop owner. Strangely enough, most of the lore surrounding Camels has to do with naked men and phalluses hidden in the artwork.) Camels Let's look at why it's impossible for the KKK to own Marlboro. The Philip Morris Company was incorporated in New York shortly after the turn of the century. These days it is publicly owned and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol MO. The claim that any one entity could own this company is laughable  there are 2.4 billion shares of MO on the market. At a November 1998 peak of $58.25 per share, that's $139.8 billion. Even at the November 1999 low of $24.75 per share, just a 1% holding of the Philip Morris Company would amount to $600 million, placing even this tiny slice of the pie far beyond the means of most well-organized, strongly-financed investor groups, let alone a white supremacist group forced by its very nature to operate in a surreptitious fashion. (It's not like the KKK has corporate headquarters, openly collects dues, or flaunts letterhead and checkbook emblazoned \"Ku Klux Klan.\") It's inevitable that a firm as large as the Philip Morris Company would become the target for wild rumors. Even if cigarette companies enjoyed a positive image in the marketplace, they would still provoke jealousy simply because of their size and the ubiquity of their product. That they're despised both for what cigarettes do and for their conduct in keeping vital information from the public as long as they did only paints a brighter bullseye on their backsides. But that bullseye would always have been there anyway. Earlier in this article we mentioned how one set of printers' marks has been mistaken in the world of lore for the eyes of a lurking Klansman. Another printing rumor exists about a set of marks located under the bottom flap of the box. Alpha-numeric renderings such as \"Wn-2\" have been interpreted by some as proof of a secret promotion being run by the company which entitles the finder to free product, either one or two packs, depending on the numeral in the string. Another version states the valuable hidden marks are located on the cigarettes themselves, underneath the paper just above the filter, and that an all-letter or all-number find entitles the lucky paper-peeler to a free carton of cigs. This tale is only wishful thinking. Though Marlboro has run a number of promotions requiring the accumulation of tokens found on its cigarette packs to later be exchanged for premiums (merchandise), it has yet to run a secret promotion, nor is it ever likely to. The object, after all, of such giveaways is to attract new customers with the whiff of \"something for nothing\" while maintaining established custom by building brand loyalty. Such an agenda is not served by failing to advertise what goodies are up for grabs or how to get your paws on them. Not all lore associated with Marlboro cigarettes is false, however. At least one actor who portrayed the Marlboro man in the product's advertising did die of lung cancer.

The original included only the phrase \"First Ex President to Publicly Speak Against a Successor\": 2017 The claim, that no ex-president before Barack Obama ever publicly criticized his immediate successor is false. There is ample historical evidence of ex-presidents doing just that. Here are a few instances: Barack Obama The 44th president offered what were widely perceived as thinly-veiled criticisms of President Donald Trump when he spoke in Johannesburg, South Africa, in July 2018, railing against what he called \"strongman politics,\" whereby \"those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning.\" He also criticized \"far-right parties\" with a platform of \"protectionism and closed borders\" as well as \"barely-hidden racial nationalism.\" perceived Speaking at the University of Illinois in September, Obama criticized Trump by name, saying he was a \"symptom, not a cause\" of an effort by powerful elites to engender fear and division in the face of social change and progress: Obama had declined to openly attack Trump for the first 18 months of his presidency, following what, in his University of Illinois speech, he called the \"wise American tradition of ex-presidents gracefully exiting the political stage.\" Obama said he had changed his mind because, in his view, the 2018 mid-term elections represented \"one of those pivotal moments when every one of us, as citizens of the United States, need to determine just who it is that we are, just what it is that we stand for.\" speech Bill Clinton In July 2007, the 42nd president took aim at the administration of his successor, George W. Bush, in its handling of the Iraq war, telling Good Morning America's Diane Sawyer \"There is no military victory here\" and criticizing Bush for attempting to filibuster Congressional efforts to bring about a withdrawal of troops: took aim efforts George H.W. Bush Although George H.W. Bush had a general policy of not speaking publicly against his successor, the 41st president did just that more than once while campaigning for Republican candidates during the 1994 mid-term elections. The Daily Oklahoman newspaper reported that Bush Sr. had offered a stinging counter-attack against Clinton during a visit to the state capital on 4 November 1994: reported Saying he was breaking his policy against criticizing President Clinton, former President George Bush said Friday in Oklahoma City he was tired of his Democratic successor criticizing Republicans ... Bush told the crowd ... that Clinton was stumping about blaming Republicans in Congress \"for his demise or things that weren't going right.\" \"He blames us and he is wrong. I'm so tired of it,\" Bush told about 5,000 noisy GOP supporters at Oklahoma Christian University of Sciences and Arts. \"I think America is a little tired of it.\" During a Republican rally in Omaha, Nebraska, the same week, Bush attacked Clinton for having \"the nerve\" to blame the GOP for \"his own failures,\" the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nreported: reported Former President George Bush broke a self-imposed silence yesterday and attacked President Clinton for taking credit for the U.S. economic recovery. Bush has been stumping for Republican candidates in the Mid-west this week. \"He has the nerve to blame Republicans for his own failures and the shortcomings of the Democratic Congress,\" the former president told a crowd of about 1,500 people in Omaha. In 1999, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Clinton's impeachment by the U.S. House of Representatives, Bush even appeared to accuse his successor of behaving in a way which demonstrated a lack of respect for the U.S. presidency, as the Associated Press reported: reported Former President Bush thinks Bill Clinton lacks respect for the presidency, but Bush predicts the country will bounce back after Clinton's impeachment trial ends. \"I have tried to stay out of all the Washington mess,\" Bush said Saturday at the end of a keynote address to the Safari Club International's 27th annual hunters' convention. \"But I must confess I have been deeply concerned by what appears to be a lack of respect for the office I was so very proud to hold.\" Jimmy Carter The 39th president more than once criticized Ronald Reagan, the man who defeated him in the 1980 presidential campaign, firmly defending his own record and offering relatively barbed comments about his successor. In September 1982, Carter responded to Reagan's earlier criticisms of the Democrat's legacy, accusing his rival of failing to \"accept his responsibilities as president,\" the New York Times reported: New York Times Former President Jimmy Carter, responding to criticism from President Reagan, said tonight that while his Administration made mistakes, \"we did not spend four years blaming our mistakes on our predecessors\" ... Mr. Carter accused Mr. Reagan of not accepting his responsibilities. The former President said that after his defeat in 1980, he resolved to pledge Mr. Reagan \"my help, my support when he was ready to accept the awesome responsibilities of the Presidency.\" \"My offer still stands,\" Mr. Carter said at a Democratic National Committee fund-raising dinner. \"When he is ready to accept those responsibilities, I'll be there to help him.\" At a press conference two months later, Carter continued that theme, saying Reagan's efforts to deflect criticism onto him were \"irresponsible and ill-advised\" and that his Republican successor had made \"radical\" and unwelcome changes to U.S. foreign policy, United Press International reported: reported Jimmy Carter criticized President Reagan for making 'radical' changes in U.S. foreign and domestic policy, and said Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin is responsible in part for failure of the Camp David accords. In a wide-ranging news conference, Carter also twitted Reagan for trying to lay the blame for the nation's problems on the previous administration. 'There is always the temptation for an incumbent politician to blame all his mistakes on his predecessor. Most are willing to withstand the temptation. Mr. Reagan, apparently, is not,' Carter said. 'The public sees through that and the results of the (midterm) election proves I'm right' ... Speaking typically with a soft voice but strong words, Carter said: \"Most of the quite radical departures in foreign, domestic and economic policy have not been good for the country. We have an unprecedented number of people unemployed; bankruptcies are the highest in years; farm income is at the lowest level ever; the deficits have never been so high, and so forth\" ... \"It's true President Reagan inherited some serious problems from my administration. I inherited some from President Ford. But to try to forego blame and say all these problems are my predecessor's fault is patently irresponsible and ill-advised,\" he said. Carter called Reagan's nuclear policies 'ill-advised.' Gerald Ford Just as Carter publicly took aim at the man who replaced him in the White House, he was also the subject of repeated and sometimes very strong criticism by Republican Gerald Ford, whom Carter had defeated in the 1976 election. In April 1977, less than three months after Carter succeeded him, Ford ridiculed the Democrat's economic policies in a widely-syndicated interview with the Washington Post: interview \"Mr. Carter's anti-inflation program came in like a lion,\" Ford said. \"It's going out like a mouse\" ... The former president, looking relaxed, voiced his criticism of Carter in a brief interview following a speech to a Republican group here [in Los Angeles, California.] Over the next three years, Ford also took aim at Carter's handling of negotiations over the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT), his handling of the economic crisis, and in the summer of 1980 he launched a devastating attack on his successor's legacy at a Republican event in Indianapolis, as the Associated Press reported: negotiations crisis reported \"The Carter economic policies have been a catastrophe. They've been disasters. We handed them the economy on a silver platter,\" Ford said, arguing that the rate of inflation was less than 5 percent when he left office and that unemployment was going down. \"The president blew it.\" Ford predicted that Carter will go into the November election with a national unemployment rate of 9 percent, double-digit inflation and double-digit interest rates. \"He'll be defending the worst economic policy of any president since the Depression of 1932. That's bad. And he's responsible.\" Conclusion The examples highlighted above are far from exhaustive but serve to illustrate that Barack Obama's recent criticisms of President Donald Trump are far from unique or unprecedented and, especially when compared to the pronouncements of Gerald Ford, could even be argued to have been relatively tame. As such, the claim in the 2017 meme which re-emerged in November 2018, that Obama is \"the first ex-president to publicly speak against a successor\" is false.

            "A discussion of the history and various types of chain letters."
        ],
        "justification": "Topic:  A discussion of the history and various types of chain letters. Origins:  The practice of circulating letters to other parties beyond their original recipients has existed for centuries, so pinpointing the exact origin of chain letters is problematic. While all manner of written materials (letters, speeches, eye-witness accounts, polemics, recipes, cures, prayers) have in the past been circulated to ever-widening circles of recipients, the first full-fledged chain letter recorded by Daniel W. VanArsdale in his massive archive of the genre is dated 1888. If we accept that a true chain letter must contain within its text an explicit instruction to the reader to make copies of the mailing and put them into the hands of a specified number of new recipients, that 1888 date is a defensible notch on the timeline of  first archive  history to point to as the moment of origin. If, however, we're willing to settle for an implied instruction to\npass the item to others for their benefit, protection, or well-being, certain written communications dating to the Middle Ages could fairly be considered the first of this sort. In them, their writers set down what they believed to be useful cures, on the understanding that such missives were to be recopied by those who received them then distributed to those people's loved ones, who in turn would themselves recopy these wisdoms to hand to their nearest and dearest. These letters were also sold by peddlers and fortune tellers. The cures detailed therein were typically combinations of recipes for simple nostrums and special prayers to be recited as the concoctions were mixed or administered. Our modern world sees chain letters of a variety of descriptions circulated by surface mail, fax machine, and in e-mail. While folk cures and accompanying prayers have dropped from favor (as medical information and resources became easier to access, such intelligences became less vital), other sorts of \"Send this to five of your friends!\" mailings emerged to fill this gap.  Contemporary chain letters fall into five broad categories: \n Money-generating (aka pyramid or Ponzi schemes)\n Luck-generation (or ill luck avoidance) \n Altruistic\n Something for nothing\n Humor\n Money-generating (pyramid or Ponzi scheme) chain letters hold out the promise of untold riches to those gulled into participating in their circulation. In their most common form, recipients are instructed to send a token set dollar figure ($5, for example) to the name at the top of the group's roll call, strike that name and address from the list of those involved, add their own to the base of the register, recopy the amended letter, and mail it to five of their acquaintances. If all goes according to plan, their small investment will reap them a fortune once their names percolate to the top of the list. (Pyramid schemes exist in many forms and go by many names. Deserving of particular mention are \"gifting circles\" or \"gifting clubs\" wherein folks pay substantial chunks of cash [$5,000, for example] to be included on a chart of like-minded investors, the object being that as new people are added behind them, they will move higher on the diagram one tier at a time until ultimately they occupy the top spot, at which moment they will receive the pool of money accumulated behind them.  Such endeavors have operated under the names of \"Elite Activity,\" \"Women Empowering Women,\" \"The Dinner Club,\" \"Spirit of Giving\" and so many more that we couldn't possibly ever list them all.) So much can go wrong with pyramid contrivances that their pitfalls hardly needs explaining. First, for pyramid investments to work, the world would need an endless supply of people, each of them with money in hand and determined to participate in the process. Because each level of the pyramid increases exponentially the throng of investors involved, the numbers soon lose meaning. For instance, suppose the money-generating come-on you received in the mail displayed five names. If everyone in the chain had followed instructions and mailed it to five of their friends, by the time it reached you it had already been through 3,905 pairs of hands, and that only provided the first person listed was the one who began the progression. Add one more level (either from having a sixth name on the roll or through one of the names having already been moved off from the top), and the number involved jumps to 19,530. Add two, and it reaches 97,655. Second, not everyone is honest, so there will always be those who will simply insert their names near the top of the roll rather than at its base. Names added honestly, therefore, will fail to move up past this ever-changing invisible ceiling (as new people enter the chain, they too will try this trick). Also, that someone receives the circular and passes it along to five acquaintances does not necessarily mean he sent his requisite sum to the name heading the roster.  However, the biggest argument against money-generating chain letters is their illegality. Missives that request money or other items of value and promise substantial returns to the participants are against the law. Sending them through the mail (or delivering them in person or by computer, but mailing money to participate) violates Title 18, United States Code, Section 1302, of the Postal Lottery Statute.  At various times the unscrupulous have tried to circumvent the aspects of money-generating chain letters that render them illegal. One common attempt is the inclusion of the additional step of having participants send recipe cards or other relatively-worthless small items along with the cash, thereby transforming the process into a legitimate enterprise wherein those particular trifles are being vended. Another is to go the opposite way, that is, label all monies involved as \"gifts\" (see section above about gifting clubs). Yet another is to process as much of the proposition as possible via non-postal routes. However, no matter what technology or plausible-sounding subterfuge (e.g.; sale of credit reports or mailing lists) is used, if at any point anything passes by surface mail, the entire maneuver becomes illegal. Says the USPS: USPS \n\nRecently, high-tech chain letters have begun surfacing. They may be disseminated over the Internet, or may require the copying and mailing of computer disks rather than paper. Regardless of what technology is used to advance the scheme, if the mail is used at any step along the way, it is still illegal.\n\n An example of a \"money generating\" chain letter: \n\n[Collected via surface mail, 1975] DO YOU NEED $8,000? ? ? ? ? ?\nLet Bill Nelson tell you how I have run one of these promotion letters  four times in the past year. The First time I received $7,000 in cash and around $7,800 the other three. It this letter is continued as it should be, everyone profits!  Yes, and don't worry about financing or paying money back.  After the first time, you'll see what I mean, and next time you will be more eager and glad.  Now, let me give you the complete story and details.  Please forward them and in about 30 days you will be $8,000 richer.  This letter will pay up to $8,000 because there are only four names at all times.  Three moves and you are in a position to receive one dollar from each participant.  This chain letter was initiated by William Neham from Nashville, Tennessee, for the purpose of investment capital.  But, now this has been expanded.  Your participation is one dollar to the first person or firm in the Number One position below, while omitting the name to whom you sent the dollar.  Then, move the list of names up one place and place your name at the bottom.  Mail a copy of this letter to 20 new prospects.  MAIL YOUR LETTERS within 48 HOURS AND DO NOT BREAK THE CHAIN.  When your name reaches the Number One position, it will be your turn to collect the fees. They will be sent to you by 8,000 persons like yourself.  Please DO NOT BREAK THE CHAIN BECAUSE IT REALLY WORKS!!  In fact, I guarantee it, provided you do not break the chain and follow the simple rules above.  Try it and see.  You are investing ONLY, ONE DOLLAR, and that is all you can lose.  Be sure to copy this letter completely. Don't leave any of it out.  Send your report to Imperial Sales Company, 3096 Ivey Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee 37914.  Let us know when your fee was sent and how much you received within nine days.  We have at the present time almost 100% return to the people carrying out this letter promotion.  The majority received $7,800.  If four names should be listed on your promotion, the one in Number One position is omitted, after you send him your one dollar. Then, put your name and address in the Number Four position.  $8,000 is capital absolutely free!  Send letters only to people who have secretaries or whom you personally consider \"Doers.\" Look  20 times 20 times 20 equals 8,000!!!!.\n While money-generating chain letters flourish in both the off- and online worlds, \"Make Money Fast!\" hustles have become so much a part of online culture that they have spawned any number of parodies. This next example is one such howler we particularly treasure: \n\n[Collected on the Internet, 1998] MAKE CLUBS FAST Recent evidence has come to light that suggests that pyramid style chain letters may have pre-dated Dave Rhodes by a considerable margin. Palaentologists recently deciphered the following, painted on a cave wall on the slopes of Kilimanjaro. MAKE SPIKY CLUBS FAST!!! Hello, not-tribe-member. Urk name Urk. Many moons ago, Urk in bad way. Urk kicked out of cave by Thag. Thag bigger than Urk, Thag take Urk spiky club, Urka (Urk wo-man). Urk not able kill deer, must eat leaves, berries. Urk flee from wolves. Today, Urk big chief. Urk have best cave, many wives, many spiky clubs. Urk tell how. WHAT DO: make one spiky club and take to cave places below. Add own cave place to bottom of list, take cave place off top. Put new message on walls many caves. Wait. Many clubs soon come! This not crime! Urk ask shaman, gods say okay. HERE LIST: 1) Urk\nFirst cave\nOlduvai Gorge few) Thag (not that Thag, other Thag)\nold dead tree\nby lake shaped like mammoth few) Og\nbig rock with overhang\nnear pig game trail Many) Zog\nriver caves\nwhere river meet big water Urk hope not-tribe-member do what Urk say do. That only way it work.\n While Urk and his quest for spiky clubs leaves a smile on our faces, the second sort of chain letters provokes the opposite response: a worried frown. Even the most rational and level-headed can't help but feel a bit uneasy when they drop luck-generation chain letters into the nearest trash bin. This type of imploration, which promises good luck even as it threatens ill fortune to rain down on the heads of those who fail to speed it on its way, tends to follow a standard outline. (Not all chain letters of this ilk scrupulously adhere to this formula; certain elements may be omitted in some of the entreaties you encounter.) \n Invocation:  The letter begins with an admonition to pray, trust the Lord, or kiss someone as an expression of love.  Origins:  A description of the person who began the letter (a priest, a saint, a sea captain, a doctor) and where (Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands) is given. Often included is a claim of the letter's having been around the world a stated number of times.  Success Story:  Accounts of the happy circumstances of a few people who followed instructions to send the letter on its way are given, with their rewards (financial windfall, sudden luck in matters of romance, miraculous recovery from illness) described in glowing detail.  Punishment Story:  Accounts are given of the setbacks or tragedies (job loss, broken heart, injury or death) that befell a few people who ignored the letter or threw it away.  Instruction and Promise:  The recipient is told how many copies of the letter to distribute and is reassured that good luck will swiftly follow.\n An example of a contemporary \"luck generation\" chain letter sent by e-mail.  \n\n[Collected on the Internet, 2000] CASE 1:  Kelly Sedey had one wish, for her boyfriend of three years, David Marsden, to propose to her.  Then one day when she was out to lunch David proposed!  She accepted, but then had to leave because she had a meeting in 20 min.  When she got to her office, she noticed on her computer she had e-mail.  She checked it, the usual stuff from her friends, but then she saw one that she had never gotten before. was this letter.  She *simply deleted it without even reading it all. BIG MISTAKE!  Later that evening, she received a phone call from the police. It was about DAVID!  He had been in an accident with an 18 wheeler.  He didn't survive. CASE 2:  Take Katie Robbenson. She received this letter and being the believer that she was, she sent it to a few of her friends but didn't have enough e-mail addresses to send out the full 10 that you must. Three days later, Katie went to a masquerade ball. Later that night when she left to get to her car to go home, she was killed on the spot by a hit-and-run drunk driver. CASE 3:  Richard S. Willis sent this letter out within 45 minutes of reading it.  Not even 4 hours later walking along the street to his new job interveiw with a really big company, when he ran into Cynthia Bell, his secret love for 5 years.  Cynthia came up to him and told him of her passionate crush on him that she had had on him for 2 years.  Three days later, he proposed to her and they got married.  Cynthia and Richard are Still married with three children, happy as ever! This is the letter: You must send this on in 3 hours after reading the letter to 10 different people.  If you do this, you will receive unbeleveably good luck in love.  The person that you are most attracted to will soon return your feelings. If you do not, bad luck will rear it's ugly head at you. THIS IS NOT A JOKE!  You have read the warnings, seen the cases, and the consiquences.  You MUST send this on or face dreadfuly bad luck. *NOTE*  The more people that you send this to, the better luck you will have. P.S.  I did not make this up,someone sent it to me and I am passing it on!  You Send it by clicking forward on the side\n The avoidance of ill luck features in numerous chain letters, especially the \"crazed killer\" sort prized by prepubescent girls who delight in forwarding \"a crazed killer or vengeful spirit will come for you if you don't forward this message to others\" tales. These next examples were sent by text message via cell phone: \n\n[Collected via e-mail, September 2009] A picture of a girl with a graduation cap on the caption read: \"Hi, my name is Alexis, I am 7 years old about 1 year ago me and my dad got into a big fight, he slit my throat and threw me down the sewer.  There was this girl named Alissia and she got the same text message you are getting now and she just erased it and didn't think about it.  Later on, around midnight, she heard laughing coming from her bathroom and she quickly sent that message to 10 people.  Later on that night, her parents heard laughing and cutting.  When they came it to check in the bathroom, Alissia's blood was everywhere.  Now that you have read this message about Alissia's death, I must kill you too unless you send this message to 10 people  no send backs.  I'll be waiting for you at midnight if you don't do this.\n \n don't ignore this. once a little girl was so obsessed with taking pictures of herself and one day she took a picture of herself and when she looked at herself she thought something wasn't right. she heard a girl laughing and turned... this was the last picture she took before she went missing. they found her in the backyard with scratches and blood everywhere... one girl named Aliie dint belive this and deleted it. that night she heard laughing and went and forwarded this message, but it was too late. an hour later her parents found her in the bathtub covered in blood. fwd this to ten ppl or she will be waiting under your bed at 12 tonight. if you don't belive it, then save the pictures and zoom in to the right bottom corner. NO SEND BACK!!!!\nPiggy back 09\n\n Altruistic chain letters are those that present themselves as seeking benefit for others rather than the financial enrichment or improvement of luck of their recipients/forwarders. Into this category fall prayers for the suffering and collections made on behalf of charitable groups or the needy themselves. While this form of the genre might indeed be the oldest (according to Daniel W. VanArsdale, the first full-fledged chain letter was of this sort; it called for the donation of dimes to \"poor whites in the region of the Cumberlands\"), the Internet has added new expressions of it. Many \"dying child\" hoaxes circulate online, each of them asserting every forward of their supplications will result in  benefactors (either named charities or corporations or unnamed millionaires) directing set sums towards the care of the stricken youngsters. While these lack the specificity of \"Send this to four people\" instructions (they instead direct recipients to \"Forward this to everyone you know\"), the languishing children are imaginary, and the forwarders add nothing of themselves to the mix (neither prayers nor donations), they are a close enough fit with the altruistic class of chain letters to be considered a legitimate variant.  first dying child Closer yet are the myriad prayer requests (e.g., the Delaney Parrish appeal) that have sprung to life on the Internet. While the \"Send this to ten people\" command is still absent (\"Send to as many as you can\" and its ilk being used instead), the people being pled for often do exist, with their travails often as described, and those moved to keep the chain going are adding something of themselves (their petitions to God) to the process.  Delaney Parrish Similarly, various appeals of the \"dying child intent upon collecting specific items\" nature (e.g.; the Craig Shergold appeal for business cards) are also close fits.  While not all entreaties of this sort are on the up-and-up, a fair number are  the children and their situations are real, as are their requests. Those participating in these chains not only pass along the requests to their circles of acquaintance but also themselves donate the items requested and transport them to the youngsters.  Craig Shergold Moving to the \"something for nothing\" category, we find online appeals aimed at augmenting the bank accounts or wardrobes of their participants, bringing them fame, or entertaining them. Of the first sort, the granddaddy of them all is the e-mail tracking hoax: Bill Gates is testing an e-mail tracking program and for taking part by forwarding his note you will receive $1,000. (Or Disney will reward you with a trip for two to Disney World. Or Nike will give you free shoes. Or Veuve-Clicquot will bless you with some gratis champagne. Or Applebees will treat you to a dinner for you and your date. Or, well, the list is endless.) These differ from \"money-generating\" chain letters in one important way: those involved do not themselves send any of their own money or possessions to anyone else, they merely forward the leg-pulls in the expectation that by doing so the promised goodies will come their way. e-mail tracking A less mercenary example of a \"something for nothing\" chain letter that plays upon the urge to seek fame rather than fortune is the Guinness World Book of Records hoax which states as its goal the establishment of a world record. For years, children have been gulled into participating in these mailings by the promise of their names being listed in that fabled book if the chain is kept alive long enough for a record to be set. More recently a snail mail version has supplemented the e-mail jape of the same design, so the hoax exists in both the offline and online worlds.  Guinness \"Something for nothing\" e-mail chain letters that hold out as the forwarders' reward the promise of entertainment are a form of practical joke of the \"Made you look foolish\" variety. Potential victims are told their sending these e-mails to the requisite number of new people (as spelled out in proposition) will cause them to receive the next installments of intriguing stories they have become caught up in reading or their computers to spontaneously begin playing either humorous animated clips (e.g. Ronald McDonald beating up the Taco Bell dog) or videos of lusted-after celebrities caught off-guard doing naughty things. But of course the promised carrots never arrive; the next chapters of novelettes fail to mail themselves and videos don't spring to life. We detail a great many such hokey come-ons in our Clip Artless article. Clip Artless We now come to the final category of chain letter: Humor. Though these offerings mimic the form taken by their money-generating cousins, those who receive them don't mistake them for anything other than jokes. These mailings are solely meant to provoke rueful smiles or outright guffaws among those they are happily flung to; they are not intended to prompt recipients to actually mail off the items or persons described in hopes of getting back a great many more of like nature. For instance, one well-known humor chain letter instructs dissatisfied wives to bundle up their good-for-nothing husbands and mail them to the woman whose name appears at the head of the list; when the senders' names arise to the top spot they are guaranteed to receive thousands of similarly-discarded spouses, some of which might prove worth keeping (the implication being that most will not).

Powell by U.S. diplomat Mary Wright is genuine.  \nStatus:  True.\n Example:  [Collected on the Internet, 2003] \n\n\nU.S. Embassy\nUlaanbaatar, Mongolia\nMarch 19, 2003   Secretary of State Colin Powell\nUS Department of State\nWashington, DC 20521  Dear Secretary Powell:  When I last saw you in Kabul in January, 2002 you arrived to officially open the US Embassy that I had helped reestablish in December, 2001 as the first political officer. At that time I could not have imagined that\nI would be writing a year later to resign from the Foreign Service because of US policies. All my adult life I have been in service to the United States. I have been a diplomat for fifteen years and the Deputy Chief of Mission in our Embassies in Sierra Leone, Micronesia, Afghanistan (briefly) and Mongolia. I have also had assignments in Somalia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Grenada and Nicaragua. I received the State Department's Award for Heroism as Charge d'Affaires during the evacuation of Sierra Leone in 1997. I was 26 years in the US Army/Army Reserves and participated in civil reconstruction projects\nafter military operations in Grenada, Panama and Somalia. I attained the rank of Colonel during my military service. This is the only time in my many years serving America that I have felt I cannot represent the policies of an Administration of the United States. I disagree with the Administration's policies on Iraq, the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, North Korea and curtailment of civil liberties in the U.S. itself. I believe the Administration's policies are making the world a more dangerous, not a safer, place. I feel obligated morally and professionally to set out my very deep and firm concerns on these policies and to resign from government service as I cannot defend or implement them. I hope you will bear with my explanation of why I must resign. After thirty years of service to my country, my decision to resign is a huge step and I want to be clear in my reasons why I must do so.            I disagree with the Administration's policies on Iraq. I wrote this letter five weeks ago and held it hoping that the Administration would not go to war against Iraq at this time without United Nations Security Council agreement. I strongly believe that going to war now will make the world more dangerous, not safer. There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is a despicable dictator and has done incredible damage to the Iraqi people and others of the region. I totally support the international community's demand that Saddam's regime destroy weapons of mass destruction. However, I believe we should not use US military force without UNSC agreement to ensure compliance. In our press for military action now, we have created deep chasms in the international community and in important international organizations. Our policies have alienated many of our allies and created ill will in much of the world. Countries of the world supported America's action in Afghanistan as a response to the September 11 Al Qaida attacks on America. Since then, America has lost the incredible sympathy of most of the world because of our policy toward Iraq. Much of the world considers our statements about Iraq as arrogant, untruthful and masking a hidden agenda. Leaders of\nmoderate Moslem/Arab countries warn us about predicable outrage and anger of the youth of their countries if America enters an Arab country with the purpose of attacking Moslems/Arabs, not defending them. Attacking the Saddam regime in Iraq now is very different than expelling the same regime from Kuwait, as we did ten years ago. I strongly believe the probable response of many Arabs of the region and Moslems of the world if the US enters Iraq without UNSC agreement will result in actions extraordinarily dangerous to America and Americans. Military action now without UNSC agreement is much more dangerous for America and the world than allowing the UN weapons inspections to proceed and subsequently taking UNSC authorized action if warranted. I firmly believe the probability of Saddam using weapons of mass destruction is low, as he knows that using those weapons will trigger an immediate, strong and justified international response. There will be no\nquestion of action against Saddam in that case. I strongly disagree with the use of a \"preemptive attack\" against Iraq and believe that this preemptive attack policy will be used against us and provide justification for individuals and groups to \"preemptively attack\" America and American citizens. The international military build-up is providing pressure on the regime that is resulting in a slow, but steady disclosure of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). We should give the weapons inspectors time to do their job. We should not give extremist Moslems/Arabs a further cause to hate America, or give moderate Moslems a reason to join the extremists. Additionally, we must reevaluate keeping our military forces in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia. Their presence on the Islamic \"holy soil\" of Saudi Arabia will be an anti-American rally cry for Moslems as long as the US military remains and a strong reason, in their opinion, for actions against the US government and American citizens. Although I strongly believe the time in not yet right for military action in Iraq, as a soldier who has been in several military operations, I hope General Franks, US and coalition forces can accomplish the missions they will be ordered do without loss of civilian or military life and without destruction of the Iraqi peoples' homes and livelihood. I strongly urge the Department of State to attempt again to stop the policy that is leading us to military action in Iraq without UNSC agreement. Timing is everything and this is not yet the time for military\naction.  I disagree with the Administration's lack of effort in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Likewise, I cannot support the lack of effort by the Administration to use its influence to resurrect the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. As Palestinian suicide bombers kill Israelis and Israeli military operations\nkill Palestinians and destroy Palestinian towns and cities, the Administration has done little to end the violence. We must exert our considerable financial influence on the Israelis to stop destroying cities and on the Palestinians to curb its youth suicide bombers. I hope the Administration's long-needed \"Roadmap for Peace\" will have the human resources and political capital needed to finally make some progress toward peace. I disagree with the Administration's lack of policy on North Korea. Additionally, I cannot support the Administration's position on North Korea. With weapons, bombs and missiles, the risks that North Korea poses are too great to ignore. I strongly believe the Administration's lack of substantive discussion, dialogue and engagement over the last two years has jeopardized security on the peninsula and the region. The situation with North Korea is dangerous for us to continue to neglect. I disagree with the Administration's policies on Unnecessary Curtailment of Rights in America. Further, I cannot support the Administration's unnecessary curtailment of civil rights following September 11. The investigation of those suspected of ties with terrorist organizations is critical but the legal system of America for 200 years has been based on standards that\nprovide protections for persons during the investigation period. Solitary confinement without access to legal counsel cuts the heart out of the legal foundation on which our country stands. Additionally, I believe the Administration's secrecy in the judicial process has created an atmosphere of fear to speak out against the gutting of the protections on which America was built and the protections we encourage other countries\nto provide to their citizens. Resignation. I have served my country for almost thirty years in the some of the most isolated and dangerous parts of the world. I want to continue to serve America. However, I do not believe in the policies of this Administration and cannot defend or implement them. It is with heavy heart that I must end my service to America and therefore resign due to the Administration;s policies. Mr. Secretary, to end on a personal note, under your leadership, we have made great progress in improving the organization and administration of the Foreign Service and the Department of State. I want to thank you for your extraordinary efforts to that end. I hate to leave the Foreign Service, and I wish you and our colleagues well. Very Respectfully,  Mary A. Wright, FO-01  Deputy Chief of Mission\nUS Embassy\nUlaanbaatar, Mongolia\n Origins:  On 19 March 2003, Mary Wright, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Ulan Bator, Mongolia, became the third (and senior-most) U.S. diplomat to step down from her post (after John H.

            "We carefully reviewed scenes of the 1994 film for holes in its storyline."
        ],
        "justification": "In early 2021, Snopes became aware of online posts alleging narrative plot holes in the 1994 film \"Forrest Gump,\" which American screenwriter Eric Roth created based on a novel with the same title. One Reddit thread, for example, debated the accuracy of a scene in the latter half of the movie in which the fictional protagonist, Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, received a letter from the computer software company, Apple. Reddit thread Additionally, a webpage on My Daily Magazine  a digital hub of self-improvement tips and other content  alleged Gump's famous cross-country run (which came after the Apple letter scene) spanned 1.5 years, based on other context clues, though Gump said he ran for more than three years. My Daily Magazine Below, we analyzed the legitimacy of those claims, which together asserted that the movie that mixed fictional characters and ideas with real events contained at least two plot holes. Before we proceed, let us note here: We requested an interview with Roth by reaching out to the Los Angeles-based talent company, called Creative Artists Agency, which represents the screenwriter, according to IMDB. We have yet to receive a response, and we will update this report when or if we receive one. Creative Artists Agency One Reddit user alleged: \"Iconic 'Forrest Gump' Scene Has One Ridiculous Flaw No One Noticed | Forest Gump is set in 1975 and he got a letter from Apple, which wasn't founded until 1981.\" In other words, the post claimed Gump received a letter from the tech company before it was established. The Reddit post referenced a montage scene roughly one hour and 40 minutes into the movie, when Gump explained his life after working with \"Lt. Dan\" as a member of his platoon and later as shrimp boat partners. Gump narrates the scene: scene As Gump mentions the \"fruit company,\" movie viewers saw him opening a letter addressed to him with Apple's retro rainbow logo and the title \"Apple Computer, Inc.\" We took the below-displayed screenshot of the moment, via Amazon's digital rental version of the film:   As you can see, the letter was dated Sept. 23, 1975. While the Reddit post claimed the computer manufacturing company was actually formed in 1981  which we learned was inaccurate based on evidence we outlined below  we pieced together events showing when, exactly, college dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created the company. As a 26-year-old engineering intern at Hewlett-Packard Company, or HP, Wozniak indeed developed a plan to build his own computer in 1975, after a New-Mexico-based tech firm announced the invention of the first-ever commercially successful microcomputer, the Altair 8800, the previous year, according to Encyclopedia Britannica and the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. Wozniak Encyclopedia Britannica Smithsonian National Museum of American History Wozniak initially pitched his design to his employer, historical records show. But after it expressed no interest in his idea, he teamed up with his former high-school classmate, 21-year-old Jobs, to act on his vision by piecing together equipment in Jobs' Silicon Valley garage. \"Jobs and Wozniak named their company Apple,\" Britannica said.  Portrait of American businessmen and engineers Steve Jobs (left) and Steve Wozniak in 1977. (Photo by Tom Munnecke/Getty Images)  So while Wozniak first acted on a design that eventually led to the company's creation in 1975, Apple Computers, Inc, was not officially established until April 1, 1976, according to an arm of The Library of Congress that documents American business and economics, called Business Reference Services. Business Reference Services The underlying assertion of the Reddit post's claim was accurate: Jobs and Wozniak founded Apple after the date of Gump's letter. Additionally, Apple did not launch an initial public offering (IPO) of its stock  which would have hypothetically allowed Lt. Dan to invest his and Gump's money in the tech company until December 12, 1980, according to EDN, a trade magazine for electrical design and engineering news. EDN \"The shares sold out almost immediately and the IPO generated more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956,\" the magazine reported. \"Instantly, about 300 millionaires were created, some 40 of which were Apple employees and investors.\" In sum, since the letter supposedly depicting Gump's stock investment in Apple was dated in fall 1975, and the fact that Jobs and Wozniak did not officially launch the company until the following spring and allowed public shareholding years after that, it was true to say the movie scene included a narrative plot hole. The original \"Forrest Gump\" novel by Vietnam veteran Winston Groom, which was published about eight years before the movie's release, did not reference Apple or \"some kind of fruit company\" in its storyline, based on our keyword search of the text. Winston Groom, In an October 2020 slideshow of \"Interesting Facts About Forrest Gump,\" My Daily Magazine alleged of a roughly seven-minute sequence in the movie, depicting the long run by Gump: alleged seven-minute sequence Forrest Gump said that he was running for three years and two months. But he actually started running the day President Carter collapsed from heat in October 1, 1979, and ran until he got Jenny's letter the day President Regan's [sic] assassination attempt was all over the news. Between the first and the second event, only a year and a half had passed. Put another way, the webpage claimed Gump only ran for 1.5 years  not three years and about two and a half months, like Gump claimed in his narration of the scene  based on surrounding details of the film that depicted real historical events. (Note: Winston's novel did not include the famous cross-country run by Gump.) However, the movie's famous \"run scene\" began on Gump's front porch in the fictional town of Greenbow, Alabama. The character said \"for no particular reason, I decided to go for a little run.\" Within seconds, viewers saw Gump running past a business in which at least two men were watching a television news cast. The news program said in the background of Gump's narration: \"President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion, fell into the arms of ...\" President Jimmy Carter indeed suffered from heat exhaustion while running a six-mile race in Maryland on Sept. 15, 1979, according to news archives obtained by Snopes. \"The President was sweating excessively and had become weak and wobbly at the 4-mile point due to heat exhaustion,\" The New York Times reported two days later. \"Carter fell to his knees and was given smelling salts.\" news archives reported While it was unclear whether the news anchor in in Forrest Gump was reporting on Carter's fall live or recapping the event days after it happened, the inclusion of the detail likely meant movie producers wanted viewers to believe Gump began his run in mid-September 1979. After passing the business, Gump's narration continued as images of him running past Alabama's state line to Mississippi, and eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean in Santa Monica, California, appeared on screen. He supposedly made the same multi-state trip multiple times, only stopping to sleep, eat, and use the bathroom. Then, at one point, movie viewers saw men inside a barbershop and people inside a cafe, including Gump's love interest Jenny Curran, watching TV news programs featuring Gump's run. One news anchor said he had been running for more than two years, which would put the date in mid-September 1981 or later, based on Carter's heat exhaustion episode.  By the end of the montage, when he apparently stopped running and returned to Alabama, Gump claimed, \"I had run for three years, two months, 14 days and 16 hours.\"  Screenshot via Amazon's digital version of Forrest Gump.  The movie's next scene showed a news program playing footage of President Ronald Reagan approaching a limousine and people ducking from gunshots. \"Five or six gunshots were fired by an unknown, would-be assassin,\" a news anchor said, as Gump listened to the broadcast. \"The president was shot in the chest.\" That detail again referenced a real-life event, the attempted assassination of Reagan in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1981, according to news archives. The president was leaving a hotel speaking event when gunman John Hinkley Jr. opened fire, wounding Reagan and three administration officials. the attempted assassination John Hinkley Jr. Based on back-of-the-napkin math, only one year, six months and 15 days passed between Carter's collapse and Reagan's assassination attempt, proving the underlying claim of The Daily Magazine webpage true  Gump's alleged timeframe for the run did not align with the actual timing of simultaneously-referenced historical events. According to ScreenCraft, an organization that aims to help aspiring screenwriters, cinematic storytellers should avoid such plot errors, big or small, that expose inconsistencies in characters' motivation or storylines. ScreenCraft \"Even the best screenwriters make mistakes,\" wrote Ken Miyamoto, a ScreenCraft blogger and former Sony Pictures screenwriter. \"The small ones are those that may slip by the average audience member.\" Ken Miyamoto",

        "justification": "Claim:   The outcome of Washington Redskins home football games has correctly predicted the winner of every U.S. presidential election since 1936. OUTDATED Example:  [Collected via e-mail, November 2012] \nDid you know....??  The Washington Redskins have proved to be a time-tested election predictor. In the previous 15\nelections, if the Washington Redskins have lost their last home game prior to the election, the incumbent party has lost the White House. When they have won, the incumbent has stayed in power.  This election year, that deciding game takes place on Sunday, October 31 ... vs. Green Bay.  Go Pack!!!\n Origins:  Our desire to understand and assert some control over the world around us is often manifested by our attempts to find predictive signs that enable us to prognosticate events  even when there is no seeming connection between predictor and event.  Sometimes one natural phenomenon supposedly forecasts another, as in the belief that a    groundhog's seeing his shadow on February 2 portends another six weeks of winter.  In other instances the linkage is between affairs of mankind, as in the superstition that the winner of football's Super Bowl augurs that year's stock market performance (or vice-versa). groundhog Super Bowl One item of this ilk which gained currency in 2004 maintained that the results of the last game played at home by the NFL's Redskins (a football team based in the national capital, Washington, D.C.) before a U.S. presidential election foretold the winner of that contest.  If the Redskins won their last home game before the election, the party that occupied the White House continued to hold it; if the Redskins lost that last home game, the challenger from the out-of-office party unseated the incumbent party.  And up until that 2004 election, the Redskins indicator had a rather remarkable record: Since 1936, the earliest  presidential election year in which the current Redskins franchise played under that team name, the team's results had currently predicted the outcome of 17 straight presidential contests.   Reality finally trumped coincidence in 2004, however: Despite the Green Bay Packers' 28-14 defeat of the Redskins at the latter's home field on 31 October, presaging a victory for Democratic challenger John Kerry in upcoming the presidential election, two days later incumbent President George W. Bush was re-elected, breaking the Redskins' predictive pattern.   The Redskins indicator failed again in 2012 as Washington suffered a 21-13 home loss at the hands of the Carolina Panthers on 4 November 2012, just two days before that year's election, but Republican nominee Mitt Romney failed to unseat incumbent president Barack Obama. defeat loss While we don't presume there is anything more behind the phenomenon than random correlation, the Redskins indicator can still boast an accuracy rate of 90% with 18 correct matches out of the last 20 elections:   \n After stumbling in 2004, the Redskins' power as election predictors got back on track in 2008.  In a Monday night game contested on 3 November 2008, the evening before Election Day, the Redskins were defeated at home, 23-6, by the Pittsburgh Steelers, a loss that foretold a change in party which would bring the Democratic candidate into the White House.  The following day, the Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, defeated the Republican presidential candidate, Senator John McCain, for the White House. defeated  On 30 October 2000 the Washington Redskins lost a Monday night game at home to the Tennessee Titans, 27-21, presaging a loss for the incumbent Democratic party.  Since President Bill Clinton had already been elected to the constitutionally-mandated maximum of two terms in office, the 7 November 2000 presidential election pitted Democratic Vice-President Al Gore against Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas.  In the closest (and most controversial) presidential election since 1876, Governor Bush gained the White House by the slim margin of five electoral votes, thereby fulfilling the Redskin prophecy. lost   On 27 October 1996 the Washington Redskins defeated the Indianapolis Colts at home, 31-16, predicting a win for the incumbent Democrats.  Sure enough, in the 5 November 1996 general election, Democratic President Bill Clinton won re-election over his Republican challenger, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. defeated   On 1 November 1992 the Washington Redskins lost to the New York Giants at home, 24-7, predicting a similar loss for the incumbent Republicans.  As expected, in the 3 November 1992, Republican President George H. W. Bush lost his re-election bid to Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. lost   On 6 November 1988 the Washington Redskins edged the New Orleans Saints at home, 27-24, predicting a win for the incumbent Republicans.  As President Ronald Reagan had already been elected twice, the 8 November 1988 election once again matched a sitting Vice-President, Republican George H. W. Bush, against a challenger, Democratic Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.  True to form, Vice-President Bush emerged victorious. edged   On 5 November 1984 the Washington Redskins bested the Atlanta Falcons in a Monday night home game, 27-14, predicting a win for the incumbent Republicans.  The next day, President Ronald Reagan handily defeated his Democratic challenger, former Vice-President and Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota, winning re-election with an electoral vote landslide. bested   On 2 November 1980 the Washington Redskins were trounced at home by the Minnesota Vikings, 39-14, predicting a loss for the incumbent Democrats.  As expected, on 4 November 1980 President Jimmy Carter failed in his re-election bid, losing to his Republican opponent, former California governor Ronald Reagan. trounced   On 31 October 1976 the Washington Redskins were spooked by the Dallas Cowboys in a Halloween Day home game, losing 20-7 and predicting a loss for the incumbent Republicans.  Two days later, on 2 November 1976, Democratic Governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia unseated President Gerald Ford (who had been appointed Vice-President after the resignation of Spiro Agnew in 1973 and became chief executive in 1974 after President Richard Nixon also resigned). spooked   On 22 October 1972 the Washington Redskins edged the Dallas Cowboys, 24-20, predicting a win for the incumbent Republicans.   The 7 November 1972 election resulted in the electoral vote landslide re-election of President Richard Nixon over the Democratic nominee, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota. edged   On 27 October 1968 the Washington Redskins lost a close game to the New York Giants, 13-10, predicting a loss for the incumbent Democrats.  Since President Lyndon B. Johnson had announced several months earlier that he would not seek another term as president, the November 1968 election was a contest between sitting Vice-President Hubert Humphrey and a former Vice-President, Republican Richard Nixon.  In a mirror of the Redskins game, the Democrats lost in a close contest (the two candidates were separated by a slim 0.6% margin in the popular vote). lost   On 25 October 1964 the Washington Redskins beat the Chicago Bears, 27-20, predicting a win for the incumbent Democrats.  As predicted, on 3 November 1964 President Lyndon Johnson (who had ascended to the White House after the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963) won a landslide victory over Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. beat   On 30 October 1960 the Washington Redskins were pasted at home by the Cleveland Browns, 31-10, predicting a loss for the incumbent Republicans.  President Dwight D. Eisenhower had already served two terms, so Vice-President Richard Nixon took up the Republican mantle against Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts in the 8 November 1960 presidential election.  Like the Redskins, the Republicans lost; unlike the Redskins, the Republicans made the contest a very close one. (Kennedy bested Nixon by a mere 0.2% margin in the popular vote.) pasted   On 21 October 1956 the Washington Redskins soundly defeated the Cleveland Browns at home, 20-9, predicting a win for the incumbent Republicans on 6 November 1956.  And, for the second straight election, the Republicans and their standard-bearer, Dwight D. Eisenhower, prevailed over the Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson. defeated   On 2 November 1952 the Washington Redskins lost a squeaker to the Pittsburgh Steelers at home, 24-23, predicting a similar loss for the incumbent Democrats.  President Harry S. Truman declined to run for re-election (he had already served eight years), leaving the field open for former Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson to stand against the Republican candidate, General Dwight D. Eisenhower.  The Democrats' loss on 4 November 1952 was not nearly as close as the Redskins' had been. lost   On 31 October 1948, the Washington Redskins walloped the Boston Yanks at home, 59-21, predicting a win for the incumbent Democrats.  Two days later, In one of the most stunning political upsets in U.S. history, President Harry S. Truman (who had assumed office in 1945 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt died shortly after beginning his fourth term) defeated his Republican challenger, Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York. walloped   On 5 November 1944, the Washington Redskins trimmed the Cleveland Rams at home, 14-10, predicting a win for the incumbent Democrats.  And win the Democrats did, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt secured an unprecedented fourth term by defeating the Republican nominee, Thomas Dewey, on 7 November 1944. trimmed   On 3 November 1940, the Washington Redskins thrashed the Pittsburgh Pirates (forebears of today's Steelers team) at home, 37-10, predicting a win for the incumbent Democrats.  Likewise, Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt became the first (and only) three-term president as he thrashed Republican challenger Wendell Willkie of New York (a former Democrat who had never held high elected office) on 5 November 1940. thrashed  Going back to 1936 puts us beyond the beginnings of the Washington Redskins, as that year the Redskins franchise was still playing in Boston. Nonetheless, their knack for foretelling the outcome of presidential elections was already in place.

Roosevelt won  re-election over Republican Governor Alf Landon of Kansas.\n downed That is as far back as the streak goes.  In 1932 the Washington Redskins were neither the Redskins nor a Washington team: they were the Boston Braves, and they played in Braves Field, which they shared with the National League baseball team of the same name.  On 6 November 1932 they won at home against the Staten Island Stapletons, 19-6, a result that should have foretold a presidential victory for the incumbent Republican party.

It literally takes only a minute, and could help to save her life, as well as help put an end to this kind of cruel and disgraceful judgment in a country that calls itself a democracy. Please copy and forward this letter to others in your address book as well. Please help her!\n\n\n https://www.mertonai.org/amina Origins:  In March 2002, 30-year-old Amina Lawal (sometimes called Amina Lawal Kurami), was found guilty of the crime of adultery by a court in the remote village of Kurani in Nigeria.  The sentence handed down was that she be buried up to her neck and stoned to death. In August 2002 Amina's appeal was rejected by the regional appeals court and her death sentence upheld. Her execution is to be carried out no earlier than January 2004, giving her time to wean Wasila, the child she conceived out of wedlock.  Amina's story is a sad one. She was the youngest of 13 children and was married when she was 14. That marriage lasted   12 years, and she has two children from that union. A year after her divorce, she wed again. That second marriage proved short-lived, lasting only ten months.  About five months after her second divorce, she began receiving attentions from another man, Yahay Mohammed. They were an item for about eleven months, during which time she conceived. After the baby was born, Yahay admitted paternity and agreed to help support Amina and the child. But he later recanted his admission, bending to pressure from his family, who thought such an admission would bring shame upon them.  Amina was brought before a Sharia court on a charge of adultery. The child in her arms was proof enough that she'd been engaging in sex outside marriage (her baby was born sixteen months after her divorce), and she freely admitted to having had carnal relations with Yahay Mohammed. Later she was to learn just how damning that admission was, but at the time she made it, she likely thought no more of it than its being a necessary part of establishing Yahay as the father of her daughter. Yahay denied he had had sex with her, and as there was no other proof against him, he was not charged. An adultery charge was returned against Amina, and six weeks later she was sentenced to death. All of this sounds wildly improbable to Western ears, which are unaccustomed to laws so frighteningly intrusive and the unbelievably harsh penalties attached to them, but this is the way of things under Sharia law. Twelve of Nigeria's nineteen northern Muslim states have adopted the strict Sharia code since 1999, and human rights groups have recorded a series of cases of punishment under the code, including amputations and floggings. Amnesty International has said the punishments amount to \"ill-treatment and  torture.\" Under this strict Islamic rule of law known as the Sharia (the same code imposed by the Taliban in Afghanistan), the penalty for adultery when one or both of the participants is (or has been) married is death.  Moreover, under a traditionally strict interpretation of the Koran adopted in those nothern states, Amina's pregnancy alone was considered sufficient evidence of her adultery.   Will signing a petition help the cause? In all likelihood it won't. The person to whom the missive is being addressed, Olusegun Obasanjo, the President of Nigeria, is both opposed to the sentence and almost powerless to do anything about it. He has said that under Nigeria's federal system of government the mainly Muslim northern states have every right to reintroduce the Sharia code into their penal law, and that while he will weep for Amina and for Nigeria itself if her execution is carried out, he will not overturn the finding of that court. Nigeria is a country effectively split into two, with Christians to the south and Muslims to the north. Those nineteen northern provinces have chosen Sharia law, and up until now Nigerian law has recognized the rights of individual states to govern themselves. To suddenly change this by overruling a verdict and sentence handed down by a court in one of those provinces could result in a civil war in that country.  Diplomatic remedies are being sought, and maybe if a passingly plausible loophole can be found, that northern court of appeals will overturn Amina's conviction on even the flimiest of pretexts, as another did in the 2001-2002 case of Safiya Hussaini, another Nigerian woman then under sentence to be stoned to death for having committed adultery. Safiya's conviction was overturned in a Muslim appeals court in March 2002 on the grounds that her \"adultery\" had taken place prior to Sharia's law being enacted in her region. Safiya Hussaini Those grounds did not work for Amina, though. The judge at the appeals hearing rejected the argument that her conviction for adultery was invalid because, as her lawyers claimed, the child was born before Sharia law took effect in her area. If a loophole is to be found in the Sharia courts, it will have to be based on other legal grounds. So far, Amina's sentence has been suspended until January 2004 to allow her to care for her baby until it is weaned.  Meanwhile, a team of lawyers continues to pursue the avenues of appeal still open to her.   Amina's last appeals hearing in Sharia court was scheduled for 25 March 2003, but it was adjourned because not enough tribunal members were available to hold the proceedings.  Amina's next appearance before the state Sharia court of appeal is now slated for 3 June 2003. Whether Amina's lawyers can successfully appeal her death sentence before Nigeria's secular supreme court (rather than the Islamic Sharia court) is problematic because such an appeal would test the authority of Islamic courts to hand down such sentences. If it were to be heard, it would create a knotty political situation for Nigeria's federal government: If they deny the appeal, they risk the condemnation of much of the international community (including nearly all of the western world) as well as the discontent of southern Nigerians concerned over the spread of Sharia rule; if they uphold the appeal, they would offend much of Muslim northern Nigeria for daring to overrule Islamic law. No wonder the President of that country is hoping the matter resolves itself before Amina's sentence is due to be carried out, and why at this point all he will offer for her are his tears. Pressure from the international community plus the announcement that several contestants in the upcoming Miss World beauty pageant (which Nigeria was scheduled to host in December 2002) would boycott the event led the government of Nigeria to issue statements in November 2002 pledging to quash Islamic stoning sentences.  However, after an outbreak of violence between Muslims and Christians (triggered in part by opposition to the Miss World content,  which has been characterized by fundamentalist Islamic groups as a \"parade of nudity\" likely to undermine the fight against AIDS) spread to the Nigerian capital of Abuja  planned site of the beauty pageant  and left over 100 people dead and several hundred more injured, the Miss World pageant organizers moved the event to London instead, thereby eliminating one of the Nigerian federal government's prime motivations for preventing the execution of Amina's death sentence.  Without a reversal of the ruling by the Sharia court reversing its ruling, preventing her execution will require intervention by force, an act that has the potential to plunge Nigeria into civil war.  Would sending letters to the Sharia appeals court in Katsina (the one which has already heard her appeal and rejected it) help? This is even more unlikely: Muslim fundamentalists deeply resent Western interference of any sort at any time, so telling them the world will be angry with them unless they reverse themselves isn't going to be the carrot that will inspire this particular donkey. They believe the teachings of the Koran and their interpretations and applications of them are entirely above matters of world opinion  to them, they are answering to God, and nothing may be placed ahead of that. Let's hope God calls them direct. Barbara \"and that He reverses the charges\" Mikkelson Update:  A revised petition circulated in mid-2003 claimed Amina was due to be executed by stoning on 3 June 2003.  The information was wrong: 3 June was the date Amina was scheduled to appear before the state Sharia court of appeal.   A further revision claimed she would be executed on 27 August 2003 and asserted Amesty International was the source of the information. Amnesty International disavows this, pointing out 27 August 2003 is the scheduled date for another appeal.  disavows On 27 August 2003, Amina Lawal once again appeared in court to plead that she be spared from death by stoning.  The Sharia judges stated at the end of the hearing that they would announce their ruling on 25 September. That ruling has now been handed down: Amina Lawal is free. The appeals court deemed her conviction invalid because she was already pregnant when Shariah law was implemented in her home province.
